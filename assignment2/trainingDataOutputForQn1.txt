<s>the September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr. .</s>

<s>only a relative handful of such reports was received , the jury said , considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city .</s>

<s>the jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous .</s>

<s>it recommended that Fulton legislators act to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them .</s>

<s>the grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments .</s>

<s>merger proposed
however , the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration .</s>

<s>the City Purchasing Department , the jury said , is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies .</s>

<s>implementation of Georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury .</s>

<s>the grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes .</s>

<s>this is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program , the jury said , but the State Welfare Department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County , which receives none of this money .</s>

<s>the jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties .</s>

<s>nevertheless , we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds , the jurors said .</s>

<s>failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on Fulton taxpayers .</s>

<s>the jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation .</s>

<s>wards protected
the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries , the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee .</s>

<s>these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms , the jury said .</s>

<s>regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences .</s>

<s>the jury did not elaborate , but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable .</s>

<s>ask jail deputies

<s>Daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 .</s>

<s>he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books since Texas was a republic .</s>

<s>it permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more .</s>

<s>the bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer .</s>

<s>the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared .</s>

<s>Dewey Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers .</s>

<s>if you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy , he said .</s>

<s>you take out of circulation many millions of dollars .</s>

<s>Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies .</s>

<s>his contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor B. Jones of Houston , J.</s>

<s>Washington , Feb. 9
-- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs .</s>

<s>the President , in a special message to Congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research .</s>

<s>the aged care plan , similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on Capitol hill .</s>

<s>it was defeated in Congress last year .</s>

<s>cost up to $37 a year
it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes .</s>

<s>the social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4,800 of pay per year .</s>

<s>the Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent -- 3.25 per cent each .</s>

<s>similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system .</s>

<s>the payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs .</s>

<s>outlays would increase
officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 .</s>

<s>both figures would go higher in later years .</s>

<s>other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years .</s>

<s>these would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes .</s>

<s>nursing home care
the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems : 1 full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days .</s>

<s>2 full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital .</s>

<s>4 community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness .</s>

<s>the President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged .</s>

<s>calls proposal modest
he said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay .</s>

<s>this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs , he said , and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals .</s>

<s>this is not a program of socialized medicine .</s>

<s>it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed .</s>

<s>every person will choose his own doctor and hospital .</s>

<s>wouldn't pay doctors
the plan does not cover doctor bills .</s>

<s>they would still be paid by the patient .</s>

<s>apart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools .</s>

<s>the President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care .</s>

<s>moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the schooling costs .</s>

<s>contributions to schools
the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students .</s>

<s>the schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships , based on need , of up to $2,000 a year per student .</s>

<s>in addition , the government would pay a $1,000 cost of education grant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grants .</s>

<s>officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 .</s>

<s>the President recommended federal matching grants totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones .</s>

<s>in the child health field , the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau .</s>

<s>he also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute .</s>

<s>asks research funds

<s>for medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities .</s>

<s>the President said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine .</s>

<s>the President said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them .</s>

<s>reaction as expected
congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines .</s>

<s>legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the President's plan .</s>

<s>those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message .</s>

<s>Senate Republican Leader Dirksen ( Ill. ) and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck ( Ind. )</s>

<s>said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance .</s>

<s>Halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first .</s>

<s>House Speaker Sam Rayburn ( D. , Tex. )</s>

<s>called the Kennedy program a mighty fine thing , but made no prediction on its fate in the House .</s>

<s>Washington , Feb. 9
-- acting hastily under White House pressure , the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation's federal housing chief .</s>

<s>only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote .</s>

<s>a number of scattered ayes and noes was heard .</s>

<s>customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency .</s>

<s>in the last eight years , all Presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor .</s>

<s>enforce by demand
the rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse ( D. , Ore. ) in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961 .</s>

<s>Oslo
the most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings .</s>

<s>this has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes .</s>

<s>in Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems .</s>

<s>this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the colonialist powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems .</s>

<s>the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence .</s>

<s>explosion avoided
in the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the J Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension .</s>

<s>the general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council .</s>

<s>there should even be no more bitter surprises in the J General Assembly as to J members' votes , since a new ad hoc J committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance .</s>

<s>Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the J locomotive .</s>

<s>even Norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the J line .</s>

<s>on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for .</s>

<s>one diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's speeches as inconclusive .</s>

<s>but he hastened to add that , if United States policies were not always clear , despite Mr. Rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy .</s>

<s>exploratory mood
a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair , with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited .</s>

<s>the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity , that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots .</s>

<s>the Secretary of State himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months .</s>

<s>but where the core of J is concerned , the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance , cornerstone of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at J disposal in European waters .</s>

<s>the Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole .</s>

<s>conflict surveyed
the secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of J realization that East-West friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection .</s>

<s>the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions : more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent .</s>

<s>this increase in the threshold , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to come .</s>

<s>each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled .</s>

<s>Washington
the Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time .</s>

<s>there is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos .</s>

<s>the United States , State Department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam .</s>

<s>they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this .</s>

<s>the United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated .</s>

<s>but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility .</s>

<s>policies modified
the inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos , rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference .</s>

<s>this is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make .</s>

<s>it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration .</s>

<s>its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas .</s>

<s>but with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises : how effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression ?</s>

<s>former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union .</s>

<s>he was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory .</s>

<s>J GOP restrained
it does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it .</s>

<s>they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans , if they had been in power , would have made amateurish and monumental blunders in Cuba .</s>

<s>one Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration on this score .</s>

<s>his reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now .</s>

<s>but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first .</s>

<s>the Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B. Morton ( R ) of Kentucky , chairman of the Republican National Committee , that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination .</s>

<s>Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard , Boston University , Brandeis , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators .</s>

<s>detente urged
this group pleads with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups .</s>

<s>it recommends that the United States seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations ;
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds .</s>

<s>Mr. Nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation .</s>

<s>but he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated .</s>

<s>until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos , almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and the professors .</s>

<s>aid plans revamped
very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration .</s>

<s>strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements .</s>

<s>policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed .</s>

<s>but thus far there has been no response in kind .</s>

<s>foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations .</s>

<s>in Laos , the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture .</s>

<s>again and again it asked the Communists to freeze the military situation in Laos .</s>

<s>but the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate .</s>

<s>and after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization .</s>

<s>J SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos .</s>

<s>but the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos .</s>

<s>( some J nations disagreed , however .
)</s>

<s>there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , Thailand and South Viet Nam .</s>

<s>the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos .</s>

<s>the pro-Western government , which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma neutralist government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army .</s>

<s>there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt .</s>

<s>if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma , whom it felt was too trusting of Communists , it gradually had to relinquish them .</s>

<s>one factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .</s>

<s>he declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by encouraging the removal of Prince Souvanna .</s>

<s>Washington
the White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States .</s>

<s>the President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation .</s>

<s>in an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime , to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems .</s>

<s>the President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend .</s>

<s>offenses multiply
the President has also called upon the Attorney General , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem .</s>

<s>simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett , a special assistant to the Attorney General , as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime .</s>

<s>his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in offenders .</s>

<s>among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age .</s>

<s>East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , Raymond H. Hawksley , the present city J head , believes .</s>

<s>Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council or anyone else locally to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time .</s>

<s>East Providence now has no civil defense program .</s>

<s>Mr. Hawksley , the state's general treasurer , has been a part-time J director in the city for the last nine years .</s>

<s>he is not interested in being named a full-time director .</s>

<s>noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program , Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director .</s>

<s>he expressed the opinion the city could hire a J director for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs .</s>

<s>Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time J job .</s>

<s>one of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin , he said .</s>

<s>along with a director , the city should provide a J headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized .</s>

<s>Mr. Hawksley said .</s>

<s>one advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program .</s>

<s>matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he said .</s>

<s>Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the J vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station .</s>

<s>he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area .</s>

<s>speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack .</s>

<s>the Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would be another .</s>

<s>Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point .</s>

<s>Mr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack .</s>

<s>such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know .</s>

<s>if the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time J director , Mr. Hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally .</s>

<s>one of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid .</s>

<s>other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government .</s>

<s>Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind .</s>

<s>Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly .</s>

<s>the governor's move into the so-called blue law controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R. Grant , deputy city clerk of Central Falls .</s>

<s>a copy was released to the press .</s>

<s>Mr. Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant .</s>

<s>the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature .</s>

<s>while the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review , Mr. Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty.</s>

<s>Gen. J. Joseph Nugent to get the benefit of his views .</s>

<s>he will then appoint the study committee with Mr. Nugent's cooperation , the governor said .</s>

<s>I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings , Mr. Notte said , to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws .</s>

<s>the governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales .</s>

<s>the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws .</s>

<s>should there be evidence they are shirking , he has said , the state police will step into the situation .</s>

<s>there has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws .</s>

<s>the statutes , similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath .</s>

<s>the Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday .</s>

<s>the only day they have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday , the council's resolution said .</s>

<s>the small shops must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community , according to the resolution , which added that they also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors .</s>

<s>it declares that Sunday sales licenses provide great revenue to the local government .</s>

<s>the council advised the governor that large supermarkets , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business on Sunday .</s>

<s>they operate on a volume basis , it was contended , and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community .</s>

<s>liberals and conservatives in both parties -- democratic and Republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , George H. Reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday .</s>

<s>Mr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the welfare type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system .</s>

<s>he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day .</s>

<s>he said he was confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910 .</s>

<s>that , he added , was when he was a very young man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade .</s>

<s>that was before I studied law .</s>

<s>some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist Party .</s>

<s>the lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist track .</s>

<s>he steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track .</s>

<s>he said that when he was a Socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources .</s>

<s>he suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties .</s>

<s>Mr. Reama , who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co. in 1955 said , both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it .</s>

<s>he said he favors wage increases for workers -- but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added .</s>

<s>indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , Mr. Reama said : a Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own .</s>

<s>Mr. Reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling .</s>

<s>a petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town .</s>

<s>William A. Martinelli , chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr. .</s>

<s>the law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that post .</s>

<s>Mr. Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days .</s>

<s>he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work .</s>

<s>a difference of opinion arose between Mr. Martinelli and John P. Bourcier , town solicitor , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled .</s>

<s>Mr. Martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while Mr. Bourcier said that a special election might be called instead .</s>

<s>Mr. Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior Court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures .</s>

<s>he assured Mr. Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible .</s>

<s>Mr. Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement .</s>

<s>he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes .</s>

<s>after inspiring this , I think we should certainly follow through on it , he declared .</s>

<s>it has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement .</s>

<s>he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission .</s>

<s>our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement , he indicated , and to tell them what this will mean for the town .</s>

<s>he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September .</s>

<s>some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter .</s>

<s>increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated .</s>

<s>misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed false pretenses .</s>

<s>several signers affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system .</s>

<s>action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting .</s>

<s>council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A. Abatuno to draft the ordinance .</s>

<s>at the last session of the General Assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective .</s>

<s>nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation .</s>

<s>at present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition .</s>

<s>local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense .</s>

<s>Plainfield
-- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones J , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the J is campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism .</s>

<s>Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr. J did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel .</s>

<s>the controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club .</s>

<s>it was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs .</s>

<s>Hughes said Monday , it is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired .</s>

<s>now he's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state .</s>

<s>Sunday he had added , we can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership .</s>

<s>Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign .</s>

<s>how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this ?</s>

<s>he asked .</s>

<s>the former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican and proud to have absorbed his philosophy while working in his adminstration .</s>

<s>Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue .</s>

<s>regrets attack
Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president .</s>

<s>he is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign , he said , because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign .</s>

<s>the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark .</s>

<s>Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary .</s>

<s>he then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign .</s>

<s>state aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority , and making New Jersey attractive to new industry .</s>

<s>decries joblessness
Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate must share the blame for this .</s>

<s>noting that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co. plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform .</s>

<s>but I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time , Mitchell said .</s>

<s>Jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for Mitchell .</s>

<s>he said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises .</s>

<s>he calls for help while saying he is against centralization , but you can't have it both ways , Jones said .</s>

<s>the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue .</s>

<s>defends Ike
earlier , Mitchell said in a statement : I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J. Hughes .</s>

<s>his reference to discredited carcass or tattered remains of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations .</s>

<s>I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste .</s>

<s>such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature .</s>

<s>it can only rebound to Mr. Hughes' discredit .</s>

<s>sees Jones ahead
Sen. Charles W. Sandman , J May , said today Jones will run well ahead of his J opponents for the gubernatorial nomination .</s>

<s>Sandman , state campaign chairman for Jones , was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel , Newark , of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones .</s>

<s>Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years .</s>

<s>Sandman said : the announcement that Sen. Clifford Case J , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveaway .</s>

<s>it is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New Jersey's problems .</s>

<s>we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington .</s>

<s>that failed .</s>

<s>we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case's candidacy of last year .</s>

<s>that , too , will fail .</s>

<s>Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave. , Westfield , as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee .</s>

<s>Mrs. Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman .</s>

<s>County Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets , who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them .</s>

<s>the proposal , Sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a lip service word .</s>

<s>Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge .</s>

<s>Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January , 1964 .</s>

<s>although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful , he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines .</s>

<s>the candidacy of Mayor James J. Sheeran of West Orange , for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County , was supported today by Edward W. Roos , West Orange public safety commissioner .</s>

<s>Sheeran , a lawyer and former J man is running against the Republican organization's candidate , Freeholder William MacDonald , for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy , now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals .</s>

<s>my experience as public safety commissioner , Roos said , has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer .</s>

<s>he said you're the kind of governor we're glad we , we Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time .</s>

in his only attack on the Republicans , Hughes said , the three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary .</s>

<s>but we'll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform .</s>

<s>we'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson .</s>

<s>we'll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November .</s>

<s>he said , you can see signs of the Republicans' feeble attack on the Meyner administration .</s>

<s>but I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead .</s>

<s>he urged New Jersey to become a full partner in the courageous actions of President Kennedy .</s>

<s>even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political future .</s>

<s>this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- Gov.</s>

<s>Ross Barnett .</s>

<s>Barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well .</s>

<s>consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year .</s>

<s>could be scramble
some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far .</s>

<s>the builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's office .</s>

<s>there are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble .</s>

<s>certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful honeymoon he had in the 1960 legislative session .</s>

<s>if Barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session .</s>

<s>the odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year .</s>

<s>districts issue
legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating .</s>

<s>Barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure .</s>

<s>the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat .</s>

<s>with eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic Delta district , and Congressman Frank E. Smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature .</s>

<s>Mississippi's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House .</s>

<s>split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck .</s>

<s>and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together .</s>

<s>future clouded

<s>with a Democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election .</s>

<s>-- the Gov.</s>

<s>Jimmie H. Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses .</s>

<s>the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue .</s>

<s>but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government .</s>

<s>the transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent .</s>

<s>the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program .</s>

<s>but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation .</s>

<s>legislators weary
indeed , the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat .</s>

<s>the administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program .</s>

<s>the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote .</s>

<s>the tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenes .</s>

<s>Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy .</s>

<s>if it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration .</s>

<s>he could terminate special sessions of the Legislature .</s>

<s>actually , Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway .</s>

<s>many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration .</s>

<s>this is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly .</s>

<s>they would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be ineffectual .</s>

<s>underlying concern
passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition .</s>

<s>he could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle .</s>

<s>then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period .</s>

<s>it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one .</s>

<s>but if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes .</s>

<s>this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash .</s>

<s>it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year .</s>

<s>if the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma .</s>

<s>since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues .</s>

<s>constant problem
in either case , it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser .</s>

<s>the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor .</s>

<s>it is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem .</s>

<s>but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature .</s>

<s>this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year .</s>

<s>a constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize .</s>

<s>any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves .</s>

<s>the new year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms .</s>

<s>Hartman impressive
Bill Kunkel , Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium .</s>

<s>tailback James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries ;
he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games .</s>

<s>Saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington State game , for four plays : he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench .</s>

<s>wingback Jack Collins injured a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll be ready for Oklahoma .</s>

<s>last week , when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the conference's top four in rushing , he said : that won't last long .</s>

<s>it didn't ;
Monday , he had four Longhorns in the top four .</s>

<s>a good feeling prevailed on the J coaching staff Monday , but attention quickly turned from Saturday's victory to next week's problem : Rice University .</s>

<s>the Mustangs don't play this week .</s>

<s>we're just real happy for the players , Coach Bill Meek said of the 9-7 victory over the Air Force Academy .</s>

<s>I think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on .</s>

<s>it was the first time we've been ahead this season ( when John Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal ) .</s>

<s>assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as a good feeling , I think , on the part of the coaches and the players .</s>

<s>we needed it and we got it .</s>

<s>Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon .</s>

<s>both turned in top jobs for the second straight game .</s>

<s>Nelson played magnificent football , Meek praised .</s>

<s>he knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times .</s>

<s>and he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown .</s>

<s>he broke that boy ( Air Force fullback Nick Arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football .</s>

<s>Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons' aerial thrusts in the late stages .</s>

<s>one was on a fourth-down screen pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory .</s>

<s>as soon as it started to form , Gannon spotted it , Meek said .</s>

<s>he timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback Terry Isaacson ) had time to turn around .</s>

<s>he really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss .</s>

<s>the Air Force's , and the game's , final play , was a long pass by quarterback Bob McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards .</s>

<s>he just lay back there and waited for it , Meek said .</s>

<s>he almost brought it back all the way .</s>

<s>except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice .</s>

<s>Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game , Meek said .</s>

<s>he'll be out of action all this week .</s>

<s>he got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game .</s>

<s>there is definitely some ligament damage in his knee .</s>

<s>Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland .</s>

<s>he's looking a lot better , and he's able to run , Meek explained .</s>

<s>we'll let him do a lot of running this week , but I don't know if he'll be able to play .</s>

<s>the game players saw the Air Force film Monday , ran for 30 minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes .</s>

<s>we'll work hard Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday , Meek said , and probably will have a good scrimmage Friday .</s>

<s>the Texans have two more road games -- at Buffalo and Houston -- before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank Stram's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings .</s>

<s>Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way .</s>

<s>Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , Jack Spikes , though he did the team's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury .</s>

<s>our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well , said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game .</s>

<s>in fact our whole defensive unit did a good job .</s>

<s>the Texans won the game through ball control , with Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes .</s>

<s>we always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack , explained Stram .</s>

<s>they can be going along , doing little damage , then bang , bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble .</s>

<s>the Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off .</s>

<s>the principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes , the flashy halfback .</s>

<s>he was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yards .</s>

<s>the Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver's Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas .</s>

<s>a quick touchdown resulted .</s>

<s>that permitted us to start controlling the ball right away , said Stram , quipping , I think I'll put that play in the book .</s>

<s>I've had it , he told a newsman .</s>

<s>I know when my reflexes are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club .</s>

<s>this was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout .</s>

<s>Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a .130 batting average in the first 12 games .</s>

<s>he took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno , Nev. , where his wife , former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen , awaited .</s>

<s>she said , when she learned Jackie was heading home : I'm just speculating , but I have to think Jack feels he's hurting Boston's chances .</s>

<s>the Union Pacific Railroad streamliner , City of San Francisco , stopped in Ogden , Utah , for a few minutes .</s>

<s>Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him .</s>

<s>the conductor said to Ritchie : I don't think you want to talk to him .</s>

<s>you'll probably get a ball bat on the head .</s>

<s>he's mad at the world .</s>

<s>but Jackie had gone into the station .</s>

<s>Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand .</s>

<s>I told him who I was and he was quite cold .</s>

<s>but he warmed up after a while .</s>

<s>I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( Liston ) got was through a keyhole .</s>

<s>he said he had never talked to Liston .</s>

<s>Liston is Bill Liston , baseball writer for the Boston Traveler , who quoted Jensen as saying : I can't hit anymore .</s>

<s>I can't run .</s>

<s>I can't throw .</s>

<s>suddenly my reflexes are gone .</s>

<s>just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging .</s>

<s>and so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants' Willie Mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree Sunday .</s>

<s>both , of course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime .</s>

<s>of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts .</s>

<s>it was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone .</s>

<s>and one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , wish I was 40 , and a top-grade big leaguer .</s>

<s>the modest and happy Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days .</s>

<s>but there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game's history .</s>

<s>yes , with Bob Grove , Carl Hubbell , Herb Pennock , Art Nehf , Vernon Gomez , et al .</s>

<s>Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball player's ball player , as they say in the trade .</s>

<s>I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct. 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18,792 .</s>

<s>Spahnie doesn't know how to merely go through the motions , remarked Enos Slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse .</s>

<s>the spectacular Mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings .</s>

<s>incidentally , only two did it before a home audience .</s>

<s>Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn's Ebbetts Field .</s>

<s>Ed Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies , the Braves' Joe Adcock , Lou Gehrig of the Yankees , Pat Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito , then with Cleveland , made their history on the road .</s>

<s>Willie's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle .</s>

<s>this is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you're an American or National fan and anti or pro-Yankee .</s>

<s>the record books , however , would favor the Giants' ace .</s>

<s>in four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases .</s>

<s>once the figure was 30-30 .</s>

<s>Willie's lifetime batting average of .318 is 11 points beyond Mickey's .</s>

<s>the Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee's park .</s>

<s>it will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump .</s>

<s>the Denver-area J audience was privileged to see Mays' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home .</s>

<s>this rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top rulers .</s>

<s>the last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the Living Room Athletic Club when games were cut off .</s>

<s>actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy .</s>

<s>this year , I am told , the J network will continue to abide by the rule but J will play to a conclusion here .</s>

<s>there are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise .</s>

<s>it is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level .</s>

<s>you would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy .</s>

<s>this dissatisfaction led to Howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game .</s>

<s>Cincinnati , Ohio ( AP )

<s>with Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries , the American League champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game .</s>

<s>Johnny Blanchard , Mantle's replacement , slammed a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay in a 5-run first inning .</s>

<s>Hector Lopez , subbing for Berra , smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth .</s>

<s>the Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors .</s>

<s>the crowd of 32,589 had only two chances to applaud .</s>

<s>in the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on .</s>

<s>momentarily the Reds were back in the ball game , trailing only 6-3 , but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out .</s>

<s>in the fifth , Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off Bud Daley , but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn't matter .</s>

<s>the Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a manager .</s>

<s>Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a year .</s>

<s>he succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season .</s>

<s>Williams is a defensive coach .</s>

<s>Gauer works with the ends .</s>

<s>choice was expected

<s>Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings , the newest National Football League entry .</s>

<s>Van Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday .</s>

<s>Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player .</s>

<s>with Skorich at the helm , the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing .</s>

<s>in the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerials .</s>

<s>Skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing .</s>

<s>coach played 3 years
Skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers .</s>

<s>an injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 season .</s>

<s>golf's golden boy
Arnold Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months .</s>

<s>he won the Masters , the United States Open and a record $80,738 in prize money .</s>

<s>he was heralded as Sportsman of the Year by Sports Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the Professional Athlete of the Year , a distinction that earned for him the $10,000 diamond-studded Hickok Belt .</s>

<s>but he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot .</s>

<s>a couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole .</s>

<s>it made him human .</s>

<s>and it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair .</s>

<s>if such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all .</s>

<s>it was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold .</s>

<s>he merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all .</s>

<s>the world's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher .</s>

<s>he boomed a 280-yard drive .</s>

<s>then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance .</s>

<s>no margin for error
on the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot .</s>

<s>the ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice .</s>

<s>he tried again and once more sliced out of bounds .</s>

<s>he hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side .</s>

<s>it is possible that I over-corrected , he said ruefully .</s>

<s>each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes .</s>

<s>so he wound up with a dozen .</s>

<s>it was a nice round figure , that 12 , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed .</s>

<s>from the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open .</s>

<s>the idol of the hackers , of course , is Ray Ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the United States Open .</s>

<s>their secondary hero is another pro , Willie Chisholm , who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully .</s>

<s>Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes , who tried to keep count .</s>

<s>stickler for rules
how many is that , Jim ?</s>

<s>asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project .</s>

<s>thirteen , said Long Jim .</s>

<s>nae , man , said Willie , ye must be countin' the echoes .</s>

<s>he had a 16 .</s>

<s>Palmer's dozen were honestly earned .</s>

<s>nor were there any rules to save him .</s>

<s>if there had been , he would have found a loophole , because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book .</s>

<s>this knowledge has come in handy , too .</s>

<s>his first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway .</s>

<s>the ball floated downstream .</s>

<s>a spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie .</s>

<s>Arnold sent for Joe Dey , the executive secretary of the golf association .</s>

<s>Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream .</s>

<s>I knew it all along , confessed Arnold with a grin , but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there .</s>

<s>for a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings .</s>

<s>yet he remains the fiercest of competitors .</s>

<s>he'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he's right .</s>

<s>that's how he first won the Masters in 1958 .</s>

<s>it happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder .</s>

<s>Arnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force .</s>

<s>ruling from on high
I can remove the ball , can't I ?</s>

<s>asked Palmer of an official .</s>

<s>no , said the official .</s>

<s>you must play it where it lies .</s>

<s>you're wrong , said Arnold , a man who knows the rules .</s>

<s>I'll do as you say , but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling .</s>

<s>he scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one .</s>

<s>the golfing fathers ruled in his favor .</s>

<s>other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through Saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football's hall of fame , players' benefits and constitutional amendments .</s>

<s>the owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division .</s>

<s>however , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks .</s>

<s>Pete Rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out : we'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other .</s>

<s>nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates .</s>

<s>if the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies , they won't be misled by the Pirates' slower start this season .</s>

<s>Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat , Mauch said here the other day .</s>

<s>the Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year .</s>

<s>they have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season , along with Bobby Shantz .</s>

<s>tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals , who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's world champions .</s>

<s>the Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7-9 .</s>

<s>change in pitchers .</s>

<s>Solly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio , for several reasons : 1 Broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago ;
2 the desire to give Broglio as many starts possible ;
3 the Redbirds' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday .</s>

<s>Manager Hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignment .</s>

<s>after Thursday's open date , Solly plans to open with Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night .</s>

<s>Harvey Haddix , set back by the flu this season , will start against his former Cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain Kenny Boyer in tonight's game at Busch Stadium .</s>

<s>Boyer is suffering from a stiff neck .</s>

<s>Haddix has a 13-8 record against the Redbirds , despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960 .</s>

<s>Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh said he hadn't decided between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday's game .</s>

<s>Mizell has won both of his starts .</s>

<s>Nieman kept in lineup .</s>

<s>after a lengthy workout yesterday , an open date , Hemus said that Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup .</s>

<s>that means Stan Musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the Giants .</s>

<s>I have to stay with Nieman for a while , Hemus said .</s>

<s>Bill White ( sore ankles ) should be ready .</s>

<s>with a lefthander going for Pittsburgh , I may use Don Taussig in center .</s>

<s>Lindy McDaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes , and he looked good , Hemus said .</s>

<s>he should be getting back in the groove before long .</s>

<s>our pitching is much better than it has shown .</s>

<s>the statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice , but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday .</s>

<s>six Bucks over .300 .</s>

<s>until the Bucs' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over .300 .</s>

<s>despite the recession , Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : Smoky Burgess .455 , Gino Cimoli .389 , Bill Virdon .340 , Bob Clemente and Dick Groat , each .323 , Dick Stuart .306 , Don Hoak .280 and Bob Skinner .267 .</s>

<s>Bill Mazeroski with .179 and Hal Smith with .143 were the only Pirates dragging their feet .</s>

<s>perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit out most of the series is Bob Friend , who was beaten by The Man twice last season on dramatic home runs .</s>

<s>Friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn't likely to see action here this week .</s>

<s>we're getting Friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good , Murtaugh said .</s>

<s>Virdon has been blasting the ball .</s>

<s>no plunkers for him .</s>

<s>six Bucs over .300 .</s>

<s>the Pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by May 1 last year , when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held them even over the season .</s>

<s>on last May 1 , the Cardinals stood at 7-6 , ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone .</s>

<s>in 1958 , the Birds were 3-10 on May 1 .</s>

<s>a year later they were 4-13 .</s>

<s>since 1949 , the St. Louis club has been below .500 on May 1 just four times .</s>

<s>the '49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning , then fell as low as 12-17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories .</s>

<s>the '52 Cards were 6-7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club's top since 1949 .</s>

<s>then last season the Birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories .</s>

<s>since 1949 , the only National League club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team .</s>

<s>those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by May 8 .</s>

<s>the club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New York's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 .</s>

<s>they honored the battling Billikens last night .</s>

<s>speakers at a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St. Louis University players who , in the words of Coach John Benington , had more confidence in themselves than I did .</s>

<s>the most valuable player award was split three ways , among Glen Mankowski , Gordon Hartweger and Tom Kieffer .</s>

<s>in addition , a special award was given to Bob ( Bevo ) Nordmann , the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury .</s>

<s>you often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing , Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , but what this team had was a little different .</s>

<s>the boys had a tremendous respect for each other's ability .</s>

<s>they knew what they could do and it was often a little more than I thought they could do .</s>

<s>several times I found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk .</s>

<s>we'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say , don't worry , Coach -- we'll get 'em all right .</s>

<s>the trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by Bob Broeg , sports editor of the Post-Dispatch .</s>

<s>Kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as well as his all-round excellent play .</s>

<s>Mankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his performance against Bradley in St. Louis U.</s>

<s>'s nationally televised victory .</s>

<s>Benington said , I've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day .</s>

<s>Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills .</s>

<s>after the coach listed all the boy's faults , Hartweger said , Coach before I leave here , you'll get to like me .</s>

<s>Mrs. Benington admired Gordon's spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team .</s>

<s>as Hartweger accepted his silver bowl , he said , I want to thank coach's wife for talking him into letting me play .</s>

<s>Bob Burnes , sports editor of the Globe-Democrat , presented Bob Nordmann with his award .</s>

<s>Bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time .</s>

<s>within a week after the injury , suffered in St. Louis's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament , Nordmann was sitting on the Bill's bench doing what he could to help Benington .</s>

<s>on the clock given him was the inscription , For Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball , 1960-61 .</s>

<s>other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the National Invitation Tournament were : Art Hambric , Donnell Reid , Bill Nordmann , Dave Harris , Dave Luechtefeld and George Latinovich .</s>

<s>this team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future , Benington pointed out .</s>

<s>by winning against Bradley , Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams' home courts , they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn't take a super team to do it .</s>

<s>St. Louis University found a way to win a baseball game .</s>

<s>Larry Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game , said to be the first in Billiken baseball history , as the Blue and White beat Southeast Missouri State College , 5-1 , at Crystal City .</s>

<s>the victory was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and a tie .</s>

<s>the tie was against Southeast Missouri last Friday .</s>

<s>Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , Len Boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and Dave Ritchie had a home run and a triple .</s>

<s>St. Louis U. was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington University at Ligget Field .</s>

<s>the game opened a busy week for Washington .</s>

<s>the Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy , Ill. , Saturday .</s>

<s>happy hitting
if it's true that contented cows give more milk , why shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits ?</s>

<s>the two top talents of the time , Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations .</s>

<s>and that's meant as a boost , not a knock .</s>

<s>Mays and Mantle , both 10-year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they've never hit the heights .</s>

<s>their heights , that is .</s>

<s>Mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown season , 1959 , when he batted .365 and also led the American League in home runs , 52 , and rbi's , 130 .</s>

<s>like the Yankees' slugger , Mays , the terror of the Giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by -- or for -- Willie .</s>

<s>his best years were 1954 when he hit .345 with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs , drove in 127 and stole 24 bases .</s>

<s>now , apparently happier under new managers , Mays and Mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they're going to pass those previous peaks .</s>

<s>labor relations
yes , we know , they're professionals , men paid to play , and they shouldn't care how they're handled , just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month .</s>

<s>the truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment .</s>

<s>for that matter , Stan Musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effort .</s>

<s>Mantle , it's apparent , resented Casey Stengel's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility .</s>

<s>the old man was almost too possessive .</s>

<s>Stengel inherited DiMaggio , Rizzuto , but he brought up Mantle from Class J to the majors , from Joplin to New York .</s>

<s>with the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him , Ol' Case wanted No.</s>

<s>7 to be not only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielder .</s>

<s>Stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats .</s>

<s>inheriting a more mature Mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway , Ralph Houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on Mickey .</s>

<s>the Major decided that , rather than be led , the slugger could lead .</s>

<s>and what leadership a proud Mantle has given so far .</s>

<s>the opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field Jr. , Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , Babe Ruth's 60 homers of 1927 .</s>

<s>four for Alvin
Mays' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year .</s>

<s>Willie's wonderful walloping Sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark .</s>

<s>next to Leo Durocher , Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the Polo Grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant .</s>

<s>I'll write what you tell me to .</s>

<s>for a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago .</s>

<s>the magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29,000 in American and British currency , mostly $20 bills , and in British government bonds and stocks .</s>

<s>this is Russian money , said Mervin Griffith-Jones for the attorney general's office .</s>

<s>he asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow , Lonsdale the Red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's secrets .</s>

<s>of highest value

<s>but just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , Capt.</s>

<s>George Symonds .</s>

<s>he said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon , Jan. 7 .</s>

<s>the information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy .</s>

<s>court cleared

<s>the British defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve .</s>

<s>so in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour .</s>

<s>almost any information about the Dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet .</s>

<s>Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed .</s>

<s>the United States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the Skipjack .</s>

<s>it was there that the two accused civil servants were at work .</s>

<s>her basic hull form ( a teardrop ) and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent Polaris missile submarines , the statement went on .</s>

<s>the atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp. .</s>

<s>thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said .</s>

<s>the hull was also a result of almost a decade of work .</s>

<s>it was first tried out on a conventional submarine , the Albacore , in 1954 .</s>

<s>the Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built .</s>

<s>reputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyers .</s>

<s>it could , reputedly , go 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month .</s>

<s>it was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes .</s>

<s>the navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in Miss Gee's purse would , if completed and handed back , have given the Kremlin a complete picture of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future .</s>

<s>in his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , Bernard H. Sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were entirely innocent .</s>

<s>had to know peddlers
when they became members of the city police narcotics unit , Sokol said , they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket .</s>

<s>they , on occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers .</s>

<s>although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , Sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were aiming at the same criminals .</s>

<s>this , he added , brought about petty jealousies and petty personal grievances .</s>

<s>in the same five year period that the United States says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy , Sokol continued , these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor's medal .</s>

<s>seventeen years ago today , German scientist Willy Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a J rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber .</s>

<s>the World War 2 German bomber rolled down a runway and took off .</s>

<s>the only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip .</s>

<s>this had never been done before .</s>

<s>now a quiet-spoken , middle-aged man , Fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed's Missiles and Space Division at Sunnyvale , where he played a key role in the development of the Navy's Polaris missile .</s>

<s>squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude .</s>

<s>at 12,000 feet , Fiedler signaled release , and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the Heinkel .</s>

<s>there was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow .</s>

<s>I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip .</s>

<s>using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage .</s>

<s>he managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m.p.h.</s>

<s>-- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield .</s>

<s>moments later the J skimmed across the landing strip , edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed .</s>

<s>Fiedler went on to make several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missiles .</s>

<s>the missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb .</s>

<s>pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , striking below the waterline of individual ships .</s>

<s>probably the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week .</s>

<s>for many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous .</s>

<s>it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ;
it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell .</s>

<s>investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many .</s>

<s>in fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares .</s>

<s>some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers .</s>

<s>a measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began .</s>

<s>the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.50 a share .</s>

<s>the first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler , Guerin & Turner , the managing underwriter , was at $17 a share .</s>

<s>and from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday morning at around $22 a share .</s>

<s>but the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it was on the market .</s>

<s>indeed , from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last January , the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up .</s>

<s>letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation , all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185,000 to the public at $12.50 , with another 5,000 reserved for Morton Foods employes at $11.50 a share ) .</s>

<s>there was even a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas stock offering .</s>

<s>we subscribe 500 shares of Morton Foods of Texas .</s>

<s>cable confirmation , it said translated .</s>

<s>but E.G.T.</s>

<s>could not let the Swiss bank have even 10 shares .</s>

<s>after it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone .</s>

<s>but the result of it all was , E.G.T.</s>

<s>partner Dean Guerin believes , an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation .</s>

<s>I feel confident the stock will qualify for the national list , he said , meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country .</s>

<s>he was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can do .</s>

<s>but what made the Morton Foods stock issue such a hot one ?</s>

<s>the answer is that it was a combination of circumstances .</s>

<s>first , the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months , driving stocks of all kinds up .</s>

<s>as a result , it is not easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings , to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend ) .</s>

<s>second , the potato chip industry has caught the fancy of investors lately , and until Morton Foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- Frito and H. W. Lay -- on the market .</s>

<s>both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months , both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market at , and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run-up .</s>

<s>and third , the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a growth industry in the public mind of late .</s>

<s>foods , which long had been considered recession resistant but hardly dynamic stocks , have been acting like growth stocks , going to higher price-earnings ratios .</s>

<s>the potato chip industry these days is growing , not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods , but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger .</s>

<s>the history of the U.S. potato chip industry is that many of today's successful companies got started during the deep depression days .</s>

<s>those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives , men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest .</s>

<s>but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms .</s>

<s>so they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock , and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like Frito .</s>

<s>all those things combined to make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and is .</s>

<s>now , if Morton's newest product , a corn chip known as Chip-o's , turns out to sell as well as its stock did , the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to .</s>

<s>in view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 .</s>

<s>thesis refuted
Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism is based on very limited and questionable evidence .</s>

<s>rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth , he said it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery .</s>

<s>danger cited

<s>the economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 .</s>

<s>the unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion , he said , was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike .</s>

<s>before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20% , he says .</s>

<s>though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas .</s>

<s>paradoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output .</s>

<s>although the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines .</s>

<s>fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently .</s>

<s>the higher price supports provided by the new legislation , together with rising prices for farm products , are pushing up farm income , making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery .</s>

<s>seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year .</s>

<s>in August our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September retail sales were 14% higher than last year , says Mark V. Keeler , farm equipment vice president of International Harvester Co. .</s>

<s>for the year to date , sales of the company's farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960 .</s>

<s>two of three report gains
among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states , two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier , with the increases ranging from 5% to 50% .</s>

<s>not all sections are showing an upswing , however ;
the drought-seared North Central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend .</s>

<s>the significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry .</s>

<s>the demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally .</s>

<s>farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products .</s>

<s>more than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation's trucks , buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances , chemicals and other products .</s>

<s>farmers are so eager for new machinery that they're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago , dealers report .</s>

<s>farmers aren't as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale , says Jack Martin , who sells J. I.</s>

<s>Case tractors and implements in Sioux City , Iowa .</s>

<s>this morning , we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2,700 model .</s>

<s>last year , we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine .</s>

<s>Mr. Martin sold 21 tractors in August ;
in August of 1960 , he sold seven .</s>

<s>dealers' stocks down
with dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country's farm equipment manufacturers .</s>

<s>for example , farm equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed about 5% above a year earlier , Mr. Keeler reports .</s>

<s>tractor production at Massey-Ferguson , Ltd. , of Toronto in July and August rose to 2,418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier , says John Staiger , vice president .</s>

<s>with the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements .</s>

<s>Merritt D. Hill , Ford Motor Co. vice president , says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers .</s>

<s>except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 , retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959 .</s>

<s>the rise in sales last winter was checked when the Government's new feed grain program was adopted ;
the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and , as a result , reduced the immediate need for machines .</s>

<s>nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects .</s>

<s>total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average , three points higher than the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960 .</s>

<s>the Government also is aiding farmers' income prospects .</s>

<s>Agriculture Department economists estimate the Government this year will hand farmers $1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments , well above the record $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960 .</s>

<s>price support loans may total another $1 billion this year .</s>

<s>with cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 , farmers' gross income is estimated at $39.5 billion , $1.5 billion above 1960's record high .</s>

<s>net income may reach $12.7 billion , up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953 .</s>

<s>the Government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-September for the third consecutive month , reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-July .</s>

<s>Kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a High Court depletion ruling .</s>

<s>the Supreme Court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined .</s>

<s>the company , in figuring its taxable earnings , deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products .</s>

<s>such depletion allowances , in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets .</s>

<s>the High Court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground , not to the revenue from finished products .</s>

<s>a measure passed by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling's impact , on prior-year returns still under review , for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products .</s>

<s>the measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone .</s>

<s>President Kennedy , in signing the relief measure into law , stressed he regarded it as an exception .</s>

<s>my approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries , the President said .</s>

<s>charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the I.R.S.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>the Service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date , purpose , amount and other particulars of the contribution .</s>

<s>requests for substantiation , the Service indicated , can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return , such as tickets to a show .</s>

<s>in such an instance , revenuers stressed , the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received .</s>

<s>a rule on the Federal deductibility of state taxes is contested .</s>

<s>a realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax , under Federal law , on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation .</s>

<s>Louisiana , however , collected an income tax on the profits from the sale .</s>

<s>the corporation , in filing its final Federal income return , claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense , as permitted under U.S. tax law .</s>

<s>the Revenue Service disallowed the claim , invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income .</s>

<s>the Tax Court rejected this view .</s>

<s>it said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations .</s>

<s>the Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a year-old I.R.S.</s>

<s>ruling on the subject .</s>

<s>the Service has not said what its next step will be .</s>

<s>Peace Corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency .</s>

<s>it provides that the $1,800 termination payment each cadet is to get , after serving a two-year hitch without pay , will be spread over both years , not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received .</s>

<s>the owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and kicked back to the company's advertising manager , the Tax Court ruled .</s>

<s>the taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager .</s>

<s>the Court upheld the taxpayer's contention that these kickbacks were not his income though they passed through his hands .</s>

<s>the Court limited its decision to the tax issue involved , commenting : it is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction .</s>

<s>a portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel .</s>

<s>the Revenue Service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the Federal manufacturers' excise tax on household-type appliances .</s>

<s>hiring the wife for one's company may win her tax-aided retirement income .</s>

<s>a spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls , for example , may be entitled to distributions under the company's pension plan as well as to her own Social Security coverage .</s>

<s>she would be taxed on the pensions when received , of course , but the company's contributions would be tax-free .</s>

<s>a frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement , experts warn , is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income .</s>

<s>in that event , they note , the Revenue Service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law .</s>

<s>possible upshots : the company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments , or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made .</s>

<s>state briefs : voters in four counties containing and bordering Denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2% sales tax within that area .</s>

<s>the Washington state supreme court ruled that the state's occupation tax applied to sales , made at cost to an oil company , by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent .</s>

<s>the state's occupation tax is computed on gross sales .</s>

<s>the court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities .</s>

<s>Washington
-- consumer spending edged down in April after rising for two consecutive months , the Government reported .</s>

<s>the Commerce Department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18 billion in April , down 1% from the March level of more than $18.2 billion .</s>

<s>April sales also were 5% below those of April last year , when volume reached a record for any month , $18.9 billion ( see chart on Page One ) .</s>

<s>the seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as Easter was on April 2 this year , two weeks earlier than in 1960 , and pre-Easter buying was pushed into March .</s>

<s>Commerce Department officials were inclined to explain the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in March .</s>

<s>adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2.5% from those of the month before , which in turn were slightly higher than the January low of $17.8 billion .</s>

<s>that is the goal of two new collections being introduced in Dallas this month .</s>

<s>the Drexel collection , called Composite , to be shown by Titche's offers a realistic approach to decorating , a mature modern that is a variation of many designs .</s>

<s>rounded posts give a soft , sculptured look , paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches , table tops are inlaid in Macassar ebony or acacia .</s>

<s>getting to and from school was no problem .</s>

<s>they either walked or were driven .</s>

<s>now they go to a high school that is two miles away .</s>

<s>one might think the problem would be similar .</s>

<s>they could walk , ride on a bus or be driven .</s>

<s>it's much more complex than that .</s>

<s>generally , they go to school with a girl named Gloriana , who lives down the block , and has a car .</s>

<s>this is a way of getting to school , but , I understand , it entails a certain loss of social status .</s>

<s>a young man doesn't like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn't even in a higher class than he is , and is also a girl .</s>

<s>why don't you walk to school then ?</s>

<s>I suggested .</s>

<s>my father walked , through two miles of snow , in Illinois .</s>

<s>did you ?</s>

<s>I was asked .</s>

<s>no , I said , I didn't happen to grow up in Illinois .</s>

<s>I explained , however , that I had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom .</s>

<s>I had to ride a streetcar two miles .</s>

<s>sometimes the streetcar was late .</s>

<s>sometimes there weren't even any seats .</s>

<s>I had to stand up , with the ladies .</s>

<s>sometimes I got on the wrong car and didn't get to school at all , but wound up at the ocean , or some other dismal place , and had to spend the day there .</s>

<s>I've tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then .</s>

<s>when they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car .</s>

<s>she has to have at least one car herself .</s>

<s>I feel a certain loss of status when I am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife , who is only a woman .</s>

<s>even that isn't satisfactory .</s>

<s>if they have to take any car , they'd rather take the big one .</s>

<s>they say that when they take a car , Gloriana doesn't take her car , but rides with them .</s>

<s>but when Gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her , so the little car isn't big enough .</s>

<s>the logic of that is impeccable , of course , except that I feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car , by my wife , when everybody knows I have a big car and am capable of driving myself .</s>

<s>the solution , naturally , is the bus .</s>

<s>however , it's a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus , and it's too hard on my legs .</s>

<s>my wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there .</s>

<s>here's an idea for a child's room that is easy to execute and is completely charming , using puppets for lamp bases .</s>

<s>most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies , and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action , rather than put away in boxes .</s>

<s>displayed as lamps , the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent .</s>

<s>to create such a lamp , order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop .</s>

<s>measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket , allowing three to four inches above the puppet's head .</s>

<s>make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted J , the foot of the J about three inches long , so that the puppet can hang directly under the light .</s>

<s>pulling strings
using the strings that manipulate the puppet , suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base .</s>

<s>in this way , you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position , with feet , or one foot , barely resting on the pedestal .</s>

<s>if the puppets are of uniform size , you can change them in accord with your child's whims .</s>

<s>although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony , it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child's playtime .</s>

<s>this isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's , according to decorator consultant , Leland Alden .</s>

<s>is there anything a frustrated individual can do about Communism's growing threat on our doorstep and around the world ?</s>

<s>more than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for Jim Kern and his wife Lynn from 4 to 8 p.m. Sunday at First Presbyterian Church .</s>

<s>at that time the second half of the Christian Youth Crusade against Communism will be staged .</s>

<s>a young real estate salesman , Kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by Communism when in the Navy Air Force .</s>

<s>he was particularly struck by a course on Communist brainwashing .</s>

<s>Kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of Communism , but never felt there was anything he , as an individual , could do about it .</s>

<s>when he attended the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade school here about six months ago , Jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it .</s>

<s>the best approach , he figured , was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church .</s>

<s>and he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about Communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote -- a Biblically strong Christianity .</s>

<s>so the Christian Youth Crusade against Communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the four-hour program .</s>

<s>this Sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation ;
a review of the philosophy of Communist leaders by Ted Slack , another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the University of Miami ;

<s>the second half of the film Communism on the Map and the movie Operation Abolition also will be shown .</s>

<s>response to the program has been so encouraging , Kern said , that a city-wide youth school at Dade County Auditorium may be set up soon .</s>

<s>until that first dedication service , he and Lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home .</s>

<s>they have five daughters -- Coral Lee , 5 , Glenda Rae , 4 , Pamela , 3 , Karen , 2 , and Shari , five months .</s>

<s>but after that service , they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table , have bedtime prayers , and Bible stories .</s>

<s>the Leningrad Kirov Ballet , which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera House , is , I think , the finest classical ballet company I have ever seen , and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky Sleeping Beauty with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing .</s>

<s>this work is no favorite of mine .</s>

<s>I am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of Imperial Russia in its most vulgar , infantile , and reactionary aspect ;
that its persistent use by ballet companies of the Soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was ;
that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the American people ;
that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms .</s>

<s>all of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the Kirov's utterly captivating presentation .</s>

<s>precise
the reasons for this enchantment are numerous , but most of them end in ova , eva , or aya .</s>

<s>in other words , no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet .</s>

<s>it seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests -- Miss Omsk , Miss Pinsk , Miss Stalingr oops , skip it .</s>

<s>these qualities alone , however , would not account for their success , and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective personality .</s>

<s>it is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the American ballet .</s>

<s>oh-the-pain-of-it , that convention of Russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished Grand Dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety , is totally absent from the Kirov .</s>

<s>this is all the more remarkable because the Kirov is to ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American politics .</s>

<s>but , obviously , at least some things have changed for the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concerned .</s>

<s>Irina Kolpakova , the Princess Aurora of Friday's performance , would be a change for the better anywhere , at any time , no matter who had had the role before .</s>

<s>she is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on , and her dancing has a feminine suavity , lightness , sparkle , and refinement which are simply incomparable .</s>

<s>hit

<s>Vladilen Semenov , a fine danseur noble ;
Konstantin Shatilov , a great character dancer ;
and Inna Zubkovskaya , an excellent Lilac Fairy , were other outstanding members of the cast , but every member of the cast was magnificent .</s>

<s>the production , designed by Simon Virsaladze , was completely traditional but traditional in the right way .</s>

<s>it was done with great taste , was big and spacious , sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes , but sumptuous in a muted , pastel-like style , with rich , quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery .</s>

<s>Evegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra , one containing excellent soloists -- the violin solos by the concertmaster , Guy Lumia , were especially fine -- but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity .</s>

<s>for crucial encounter
one of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev .</s>

<s>Mr. Kennedy replied : I'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground .</s>

<s>the President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable .</s>

<s>but he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting .</s>

<s>he wanted to buy time to strengthen the U. S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy .</s>

<s>last Friday the White House announced : President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 .</s>

<s>the announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations .</s>

<s>the heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader .</s>

<s>he was not going to Vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned .</s>

<s>but Mr. Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe .</s>

<s>that objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting .</s>

<s>despite efforts by Washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting , it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war .</s>

<s>road to Vienna
the U. S. and Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace at the summit of the nations .</s>

<s>the first time was in 1955 when a full-dress Big Four summit meeting produced the spirit of Geneva .</s>

<s>the spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads into the Middle East .</s>

<s>in 1959 President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev held an informal session in the U. S. .</s>

<s>that meeting produced the spirit of Camp David -- a spirit , it later turned out , that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a Berlin settlement .</s>

<s>on the third occasion -- another Big Four summit session at Paris a year ago -- there was no problem of an illusory spirit .</s>

<s>Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U. S. for the J incident .</s>

<s>the episode tended to confirm the U. S. belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the Allies , rather than genuine negotiation , were the Soviet leader's real aims in summitry .</s>

<s>pre-inaugural position
thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President , Mr. Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem .</s>

<s>shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the Soviet leader in these words : as long as Mr. Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither Camp David talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations .</s>

<s>the President had set for himself the task , which he believed vital , of awakening the U. S. and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance .</s>

<s>he did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary .</s>

<s>he wanted time , too , to review the United States' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating .</s>

<s>above all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstep .</s>

<s>attitude flexible
at the same time the President took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader .</s>

<s>ideally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels .</s>

<s>but Mr. Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting , provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it .</s>

<s>it would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war , to try to probe Mr. Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear his own views .</s>

<s>moreover , an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U. S. was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions .</s>

<s>both elements -- the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson brought back to Russia late in February .</s>

<s>the letter , dated Feb. 22 , was delivered to Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk , Siberia , on March 9 .</s>

<s>it dealt mainly with a broad range of East-West issues .</s>

<s>but it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted .</s>

<s>developments over the next two months , however , caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing .</s>

<s>there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly .</s>

<s>deadlock on tests
the President was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at Geneva .</s>

<s>the deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand for a three-man ( East , West and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machinery .</s>

<s>in the U. S. , strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may be secretly testing .</s>

<s>Mr. Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament .</s>

<s>there was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons , particularly to Communist China .</s>

<s>the question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent .</s>

<s>moreover , Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the U. N. Secretariat and the International Control Commission for Laos .</s>

<s>Mr. Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible .</s>

<s>developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting .</s>

<s>initially the White House reaction was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting .</s>

<s>at the same time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist pressure .</s>

<s>in Cuba , the U. S. had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even on its own doorstep .</s>

<s>in Laos , the picture was almost equally bad .</s>

<s>U. S. willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be neutralized on Soviet terms .</s>

<s>beyond that , Allied disagreement about military intervention in Laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-Communist forces .</s>

<s>as a result , the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations on Laos , and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast Asia are under increased pressure .</s>

<s>in the light of those events , there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev might overreach himself .</s>

<s>Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive .</s>

<s>he has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out .</s>

<s>the President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as Berlin , Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning back .</s>

<s>it was in the midst of such White House deliberations that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the U. S. Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in the near future .</s>

<s>Mr. Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer by May 20 after consultation with the Allies .</s>

<s>the response from London , Paris and Bonn was favorable .</s>

<s>firm arrangements for the meeting in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange between Moscow and Washington last week .</s>

<s>apparently at the insistence of the U. S. , the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow last Friday emphasized the informal nature of the meeting .</s>

<s>the Washington announcement said : the President and Chairman Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries .</s>

<s>the meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries .</s>

<s>the outlook the Vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned , 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who , in Mr. Kennedy's own words , is shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident , and a 44-year-old President ( his birthday is May 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy .</s>

<s>the announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the U. S. of both approval and disapproval .</s>

<s>the approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at Vienna .</s>

<s>the inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations .</s>

<s>but those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary .</s>

<s>Mr. Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men .</s>

<s>the feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the President and that plain talk by Mr. Kennedy would give him pause .</s>

<s>apart from the personal equation , another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U.S. appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit .</s>

<s>Premier Khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway .</s>

<s>this time the initiative came , in part at least , from Washington .</s>

<s>other allies consulted
there was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr. Khrushchev , the President will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied leaders .</s>

<s>thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity .</s>

<s>finally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President's making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord .</s>

<s>there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world .</s>

<s>if tests are to be resumed , the argument went , it is vital that the U. S. make plain that the onus belongs to the Soviet Union .</s>

<s>disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse .</s>

<s>after Cuba and Laos , it was argued , Mr. Khrushchev will interpret the President's consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds .</s>

<s>moreover , the President is meeting the Soviet leader at a time when the Administration has still not decided on the scope of America's firm foreign policy commitments .</s>

<s>the question was raised , for example , as to what attitude the President would take if Mr. Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from Southeast Asia to the Middle East .</s>

<s>there are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory .</s>

<s>mollusks are a case in point .</s>

<s>the shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development .</s>

<s>though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education .</s>

<s>there can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities .</s>

<s>the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that .</s>

<s>by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence .</s>

<s>there is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture .</s>

<s>viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university .</s>

<s>but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American Catholic project ;
certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy .</s>

<s>official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds .</s>

<s>American Catholics have responded generously to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning .</s>

<s>they have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made .</s>

<s>diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility .</s>

<s>all of this may be understandable enough : it is , however , in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise .</s>

<s>yet for better or for worse , the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities .</s>

<s>community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible .</s>

<s>to understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of American Catholic higher education , it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community .</s>

<s>it is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment .</s>

<s>a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere .</s>

<s>the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension .</s>

<s>the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship .</s>

<s>American Catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of private enterprise -- the private enterprise of religious communities .</s>

<s>had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees .</s>

<s>there is however no point in speculating about such a possibility : the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the family business .</s>

<s>this family-community spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement .</s>

<s>it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American Catholic higher education , in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas .</s>

<s>I think for example of three women's colleges with pitifully small enrollments , clustered within a few miles of a major Catholic university , which is also co-educational .</s>

<s>this is not an isolated example ;
this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough .</s>

<s>it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot .</s>

<s>apart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there is another aspect of the family business spirit in American Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny .</s>

<s>for while the past needs of the Church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its pursuit of excellence .</s>

<s>at the earlier pre-academic excellence stage of Catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis .</s>

<s>but with today's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for outsiders becomes more pressing .</s>

<s>the problem is not merely that more outside teachers are needed but that a different brand is called for .</s>

<s>commenting on the earlier stage , the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term teacher-employee ( as opposed to , e.g.</s>

<s>, maintenance employee ) was a not inapt description .</s>

<s>today however , the outsider is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university .</s>

<s>and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement .</s>

<s>in the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it : even with the best of intentions he ( the President of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities .</s>

<s>it is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) the attainment of excellence .</s>

<s>the pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame : it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by the organization which actually owns it , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished outside faculty .</s>

<s>it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to the organization which actually owns the university : this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension .</s>

<s>but in any case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one .</s>

<s>outside faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business .</s>

<s>there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university .</s>

<s>in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel .</s>

<s>word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences .</s>

<s>expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype .</s>

<s>in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott : all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere .</s>

<s>to appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the Civil Service .</s>

<s>much has been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure .</s>

<s>this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated .</s>

<s>when a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services .</s>

<s>a man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the family .</s>

<s>just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions .</s>

<s>adequate compensation is indispensable .</s>

<s>yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place .</s>

<s>broadly speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university .</s>

<s>religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification .</s>

<s>there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels .</s>

<s>the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , are a contribution to the total good of the institution .</s>

<s>but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation .</s>

<s>the second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the in-group that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself .</s>

<s>this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure .</s>

<s>yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order .</s>

<s>the first is a negative warning : there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority .</s>

<s>in the case of academic personnel the feeling of participation can hardly be faked .</s>

<s>competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own decisions .</s>

<s>those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by busy-work and ersatz decision making .</s>

<s>in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all .</s>

<s>in the Notre Dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to luncheon-table communication .</s>

<s>in itself there is nothing wrong with this form of participation : the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy , i.e.</s>

<s>, members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangements .</s>

<s>Sen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws .</s>

<s>once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally .</s>

<s>or , in the words of Anatole France , the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges .</s>

<s>the public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites .</s>

<s>the Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program .</s>

<s>in addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill .</s>

<s>it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike .</s>

<s>Business Week ( Aug. 9 , 1961 ) reports that the United Aircraft Company , against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating .</s>

<s>the company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors : advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers .</s>

<s>the company has billed the United States Government for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business .</s>

<s>Rep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee .</s>

<s>the committee remains unresponsive .</s>

<s>neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan been heard from on the matter ;
they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions .</s>

<s>the recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained .</s>

<s>the anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines ;
it must play a game in which there never is a winner .</s>

<s>the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law .</s>

<s>hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy .</s>

<s>let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric , Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market .</s>

<s>the industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied .</s>

<s>the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment .</s>

<s>accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price .</s>

<s>naturally , enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time .</s>

<s>should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry .</s>

<s>Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by unfair competition .</s>

<s>but if they show self-restraint , they don't get the orders .</s>

<s>under the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted .</s>

<s>engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants .</s>

<s>the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that General Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows .</s>

<s>in other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday .</s>

<s>and which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday ?</s>

<s>the question might be asked : don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ?</s>

<s>why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws ?</s>

<s>the past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold , in The Folklore of Capitalism , back in 1937 .</s>

<s>he wrote : ( P. 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure .</s>

<s>( P. 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship .</s>

<s>( P. 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control .</s>

<s>if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest .</s>

<s>a secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle .</s>

<s>however , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational .</s>

<s>quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union .</s>

<s>those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform .</s>

<s>before 1933 , individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English .</s>

<s>the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of Section 7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle .</s>

<s>the Wagner Act , the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining .</s>

<s>the basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition .</s>

<s>if a union cannot perform this function , then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud .</s>

<s>the tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession .</s>

<s>the problem must be faced squarely .</s>

<s>if laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by the way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them .</s>

<s>human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America .</s>

<s>as early as 1776 , Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations : we have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work ;
but many against combining to raise it .</s>

<s>eighteenth-century England , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies .</s>

<s>in 1825 , the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared : it is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies .</s>

<s>there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopoly .</s>

<s>the courts shared the opinion of the employers .</s>

<s>In people vs. Fisher , Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared : without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it ;
but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means .</s>

<s>compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin , according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment .</s>

<s>Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation .</s>

<s>his bill , allegedly aimed at Hoffa , would amend the Sherman , Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international .</s>

<s>paradoxically , the same week in which Senator McClellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act .</s>

<s>indeed , it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws ;
for example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers .</s>

<s>at the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates .</s>

<s>it was most effective against trade unions .</s>

<s>in the famous Danbury Hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices , e.g.</s>

<s>the suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment .</s>

<s>in 1914 , the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity .</s>

<s>at Geneva in 1954 , to get the war in Indo-China settled , the British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state , North Viet Nam -- which then , predictably , became a base for Communist operations against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos .</s>

<s>the late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the West .</s>

<s>the Congress turmoil in the House

<s>there were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee : 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely Mississippi's 14-term William Meyers Colmer ( pronounced Calmer ) .</s>

<s>in 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry Truman , and in 1957 , after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow Democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage .</s>

<s>( in the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week , Judge Smith threatened reprisal against Powell .</s>

<s>said he : we will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here .

<s>but Speaker Sam Rayburn , after huddling in Palm Beach with President-elect Kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective .</s>

<s>( one big question : if Colmer was to be purged , what should the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported the maverick electors ?

<s>in all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash .</s>

<s>if the Southerners were sufficiently aroused , they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships , leaving Sam Rayburn leading a truncated , unworkable party .</s>

<s>with that possibility in mind , Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees , and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise .</s>

<s>battle in the senate

<s>question at issue : how big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ?</s>

<s>a wide-ranging , bipartisan force -- from Minnesota's Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts' Republican Leverett Saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills .</s>

<s>Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of Senators .</s>

<s>Georgia's Dick Russell objected politely , and the battle was joined .</s>

<s>privately , the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage .</s>

<s>privately , they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon .</s>

<s>in 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress , and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not binding .</s>

<s>armed with the Nixon opinion , the Senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week .</s>

<s>hopefully , the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all .</s>

<s>Republicans last act

<s>Arnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief .</s>

<s>just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament .</s>

<s>and that is just what happened on the last few holes .</s>

<s>the Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer .</s>

<s>Player was the first to feel its teeth .</s>

<s>after playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , Player's game rapidly fell to pieces .</s>

<s>he bogeyed the 10th .</s>

<s>after a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th .</s>

<s>he bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 .</s>

<s>as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , Player was almost in tears .</s>

<s>he could read on the nearby scoreboard that Palmer , by then playing the 15th hole , was leading him by a stroke .</s>

<s>Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player , and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes .</s>

<s>now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf .</s>

<s>when Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole , he seemed to have the championship won .</s>

<s>but the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression .</s>

<s>in trying to hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a J tower .</s>

<s>afterwards , Palmer told Charlie Coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast .</s>

<s>he did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out , giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lost .</s>

<s>when the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feet .</s>

<s>Palmer was now putting merely for a tie , and Player , who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment , stared in amazement when Palmer missed the putt .</s>

<s>Palmer's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with Coe .</s>

<s>the lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur , who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years , refused to let the Masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69 .</s>

<s>end at seven
until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place .</s>

<s>as evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69 .</s>

<s>his three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by Bill Collins , the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long .</s>

<s>but Palmer knew , as did everybody else at Augusta , that his streak was about to be broken .</s>

<s>half an hour after he finished his round , Player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of Palmer .</s>

<s>more than a streak had ended .</s>

<s>long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player .</s>

<s>unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case .</s>

<s>when the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering prestige .</s>

<s>as if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments .</s>

<s>Player won only one .</s>

<s>but as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago , Player was leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere .</s>

<s>on the final round at Pensacola , the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at the time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come .</s>

<s>on that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won it .</s>

<s>but whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour .</s>

<s>Player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer .</s>

<s>he outplayed Palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71 .</s>

<s>thereafter , until the Masters , Player gradually increased his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at Miami .</s>

<s>when they reached Augusta last week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date .</s>

<s>instant rivalry
on Thursday , the first day of the Masters , the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly .</s>

<s>it was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National course .</s>

<s>the usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences .</s>

<s>Palmer's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with Bob Rosburg .</s>

<s>but Player was only one stroke back , with a 69 .</s>

<s>even so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between Palmer and Player .</s>

<s>a lot of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70 ;
or Ken Venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better ;
or Rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries ;
or even old Byron Nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf .</s>

<s>( on Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe .

<s>on Friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus .</s>

<s>Rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good day .</s>

<s>as Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender .</s>

<s>Player began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th .</s>

<s>on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament .</s>

<s>he birdied the 13th , the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 .</s>

<s>starting half an hour behind Player in company with British Open Champion Kel Nagle , Palmer birdied the 2nd , the 9th , the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 .</s>

<s>the roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph .</s>

<s>at one point late in the day , when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole .</s>

<s>without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply .</s>

<s>the boldness of champions
anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course .</s>

<s>it is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence .</s>

<s>the bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions .</s>

<s>Bob Jones played that way .</s>

<s>Byron Nelson did , Hogan did .</s>

<s>and last week at the Masters Palmer and Player did .</s>

<s>as the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest , it was Player's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead .</s>

<s>this day Palmer had started first .</s>

<s>as Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day .</s>

<s>Player immediately proceeded to follow suit .</s>

<s>in fact , he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes .</s>

<s>but Player's real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards .</s>

<s>he hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways .</s>

<s>having hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out .</s>

<s>Player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gambling .</s>

<s>the latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green .</s>

<s>I was hitting the ball well , Player said later , and I felt strong .</s>

<s>when you're playing like that you'd better attack .</s>

<s>Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget .</s>

<s>it struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge .</s>

<s>from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 .</s>

<s>Palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troubles .</s>

<s>they started on the 4th hole , a 220-yard par-3 .</s>

<s>on this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days .</s>

<s>at the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green .</s>

<s>his bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par .</s>

<s>starting the second nine , Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it .</s>

<s>but when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , the other team thought no one was out there , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous .</s>

( 3 ) the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them ;

<s>even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation , insists Hank Greenberg , now vice-president of the Chicago White Sox .</s>

<s>it has to be easier with two of them .</s>

<s>how can you walk Maris to get to Mantle ?</s>

<s>roommates :
neither Mantle nor Maris , understandably , will predict 60 home runs for himself .</s>

<s>although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote : the important thing is to win the pennant .</s>

<s>but one thing is for certain : there is no dissension between Mantle , the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957 , and Maris , the J in 1960 .</s>

<s>each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ( I hope Roger hits 80 , Mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ( and I hope I hit 81 ) .</s>

<s>the sluggers get along so well in fact , that with their families at home for the summer ( Mantle's in Dallas , Maris's in Kansas City ) , they are rooming together .</s>

<s>Mantle , Maris , and Bob Cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in Jamaica , Long Island , not far from New York International Airport .</s>

<s>the three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining room , living room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture .</s>

<s>Mantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom ;
Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room .</s>

<s>they divide up the household chores : Cerv does most of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , Mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible ) , and Maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium .</s>

<s>Mantle , Maris , and Cerv probably share one major-league record already : among them , they have fifteen children -- eight for Cerv , four for Mantle , and three for Maris .</s>

<s>as roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , Mantle , 29 , who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago , and Maris , 26 , who came to the Yankees from Kansas City two years ago , have strikingly similar backgrounds .</s>

<s>both were scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( Mantle in Commerce , Okla. , Maris in Fargo , N.D. ) ;
as halfbacks , both came close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma ( sometimes in the minors , Maris recalls , I wished I had gone to Oklahoma ) .</s>

<s>to an extent , the two even look alike .</s>

<s>both have blue eyes and short blond hair .</s>

<s>both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but Mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ) , looks bigger .</s>

<s>with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to order .</s>

<s>Maris purchases $100 suits from Simpson's in New York .</s>

<s>Mantle , more concerned with dress , buys his suits four at a time at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and pays as much as $250 each .</s>

<s>light reading :
neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer .</s>

<s>Mantle so appreciated delicate Miller's literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips .</s>

<s>Mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking .</s>

<s>what do you and Mickey talk about at home ?</s>

<s>a reporter asked Maris recently .</s>

<s>to tell you the truth , Maris said , Mickey don't talk much .</s>

<s>this is no surprising trait for a ballplayer .</s>

<s>what is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are trying to be cooperative .</s>

<s>of the two , Mantle is by nature the less outgoing , Maris the more outspoken .</s>

<s>but last week , when a reporter was standing near Mantle's locker , Mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote .</s>

<s>see that kid ?</s>

<s>he said , pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy .</s>

<s>that's ( Yogi ) Berra's .</s>

<s>I'll never forget one time I struck out three times , dropped a fly ball , and we lost the game .</s>

<s>I came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says : you stunk .</s>

<s>Maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen .</s>

<s>when I've made a dumb play , he says , I don't want to talk to anyone .</s>

<s>I'm angry .</s>

<s>by his own confession , Maris is an angry young man .</s>

<s>benched at Tulsa in 1955 , he told manager Dutch Meyer : I can't play for you .</s>

<s>send me where I can play .</s>

<s>( Meyer sent him to Reading , Pa. .
)</s>

<s>benched at Indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager Kerby Farrell : I'm not learning anything on the bench .</s>

<s>play me .</s>

<s>( Farrell did -- and Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series .
)</s>

<s>that's the way I am , he says .</s>

<s>I tell people what I think .</s>

<s>if you're a good ballplayer , you've got to get mad .</s>

<s>give me a team of nine angry men and I'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of ten times .</s>

<s>idols' idols :
one good indication of the two men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes .</s>

<s>Maris's was Ted Williams .</s>

<s>when I was a kid , Maris told a sportswriter last week , I used to follow Williams every day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not .</s>

<s>when you came up to the majors , did you seek out Williams for advice ?</s>

<s>are you kidding ?</s>

<s>said Maris .</s>

<s>you're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize .</s>

<s>mantle's hero was Joe DiMaggio .</s>

<s>when Mickey went to the Yankees , says Mark Freeman , an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver , DiMaggio still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his .</s>

<s>but DiMaggio never said a word .</s>

<s>it crushed Mickey .</s>

<s>he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star , this never would be said of him .</s>

<s>Mantle has kept the vow .</s>

<s>among all the Yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookies .</s>

<s>neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else .</s>

<s>if laying ties on a railroad track , which he once did for $1 an hour , paid more than playing right field for the Yankees , Maris would lay ties on a railroad track .</s>

<s>if working in a zinc mine , which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour , paid more than playing center field for the Yankees , Mantle would work in a zinc mine .</s>

<s>but since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts , Mantle and Maris concentrate on baseball .</s>

<s>they try to play baseball the best they can .</s>

<s>each is a complete ballplayer .</s>

<s>Mantle , beyond any question , can do more things well .</s>

<s>( one of the reasons they get along fine , says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men , is that both realize Mantle is head-and-shoulders above Maris .
)</s>

<s>hitting , Mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed , Maris only left-handed .</s>

<s>they both possess near classic stances , dug in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swings .</s>

<s>Mantle is considerably better hitting for average ( .332 , fourth in the league , to .280 for Maris so far this year ) .</s>

<s>both are good bunters : Maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues ;
Mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base .</s>

<s>both have brilliant speed : Mantle was timed from home plate ( batting left-handed ) to first base in 3.1 seconds , faster than any other major leaguer ;
Maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against Luis Aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the White Sox .</s>

<s>both are good , daring fielders : Mantle covers more ground ;
Maris's throwing arm is stronger .</s>

<s>yet with all their skills , the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one basic : the home run .</s>

<s>with this ultimate weapon , the two Yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season .</s>

<s>( American League expansion created , inevitably , weaker teams .</s>

<s>only two teams in each league ( the Yankees and Detroit , the Dodgers and Cincinnati ) are battling for first place .</s>

<s>appropriately , the emphasis on the home run , at a peak this year , came into being at baseball's lowest moment .</s>

<s>in 1920 , as the startling news that the 1919 White Sox had conspired to lose the World Series leaked out , fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball .</s>

<s>G. David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe's best hotels , but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of Pittsburgh .</s>

<s>there the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collecting art .</s>

<s>last week , in the German city of Dusseldorf , G. David Thompson was making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause .</s>

<s>on display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale .</s>

<s>like Philadelphia's late Dr. Albert C. Barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( Time , Jan. 2 ) , Thompson , at 61 , is something of a legend in his own lifetime .</s>

<s>he made his fortune during World War 2 when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom .</s>

<s>even before he hit big money , he had begun buying modern paintings .</s>

<s>he gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best .</s>

<s>he was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away , and the Museum of Modern Art's Alfred Barr said of him : I have never mentioned a new artist that Thompson didn't know about .</s>

<s>he might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting .</s>

<s>he could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he was tough .</s>

<s>he bought up Cezannes , Braques , Matisses , Legers , a splendid Picasso series , more than 70 Giacometti sculptures .</s>

<s>he gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees in the world .</s>

<s>all these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone's Throw , outside Pittsburgh , and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them .</s>

<s>two years ago Thompson offered his collection to the city .</s>

<s>but he insisted that it be housed in a special museum .</s>

<s>Pittsburgh turned him down , just as Pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years .</s>

<s>he went then to a 40-year-old Basel art dealer named Ernst Beyeler , with whom he had long been trading pictures .</s>

<s>last year Beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of Klees to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia , which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built .</s>

<s>last week most of the other prizes , once offered to Pittsburgh , went on the block .</s>

<s>at the opening of the Dusseldorf show , Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time .</s>

<s>break in Georgia
the University of Georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color .</s>

<s>but in all its 175 years , not a single Negro student has entered its classrooms .</s>

<s>last week Federal District Judge William A. Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a qualified Negro boy and girl .</s>

<s>their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate school , in Georgia -- and in Alabama , Mississippi and South Carolina as well .</s>

<s>for 18 months , Hamilton Holmes , 19 , and Charlayne Hunter , 18 , had tried to get into the university .</s>

<s>they graduated together from Atlanta's Turner High School , where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third .</s>

<s>the university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skins .</s>

<s>Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse ( Negro ) College , where he is a B student and star halfback .</s>

<s>Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State University .</s>

<s>last fall , after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court , Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again .</s>

<s>Charlayne was tentatively admitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at Wayne State .</s>

<s>but Holmes was rejected again on the basis of his record and interview .</s>

<s>the evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for Holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation .</s>

<s>Holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution , or a beatnik parlor or teahouse .</s>

<s>no , said he , but officials still called him evasive .</s>

<s>they also said he lied in saying that he had never been arrested .</s>

<s>their reason : Holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine , had his license suspended .</s>

<s>Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes .</s>

<s>the real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school .</s>

<s>Judge Bootle's decision : the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color .</s>

<s>the state will appeal -- but few think it will actually try to close the university .</s>

<s>catch for Chicago

<s>out went letters to 60,000 old grads , asking for suggestions .</s>

<s>such academic statesmen as James B. Conant were consulted .</s>

<s>two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors , including Adlai Stevenson , Richard Nixon , and Harvard's Dean McGeorge Bundy .</s>

<s>the debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator , but rather , as Trustee Chairman Glen A. Lloyd put it , a top scholar in his own right -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago .</s>

<s>last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's acting dean of the faculty : dynamic Geneticist George Wells Beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( Time , Cover , July 14 , 1958 ) .</s>

<s>it fell to Chancellor Kimpton , now a Standard Oil ( Indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins .</s>

<s>he threw out some of Hutchins' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2,100 , nearly doubled endowment to $139.3 million .</s>

<s>but though Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady Hutchins era .</s>

<s>at Caltech , Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology division since 1946 .</s>

<s>but he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making .</s>

<s>Beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters ;

<s>a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end .</s>

<s>but a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away .</s>

<s>the man was King Leopold 2 of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good .</s>

<s>by force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa .</s>

<s>this is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ;
and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity .</s>

<s>its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ;
they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking .</s>

<s>the population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major culture clusters and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects .</s>

<s>the religions of the people include Christianity , Mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism .</s>

<s>the climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate .</s>

<s>the hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars .</s>

<s>to make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case ;
it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done , or failed to do , in the Congo since 1885 .</s>

<s>at first the Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property .</s>

<s>but by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience .</s>

<s>the Belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism .</s>

<s>one definition of paternalism is the principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children .</s>

<s>the honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment .</s>

<s>ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child , if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant .</s>

<s>the Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oil .</s>

<s>the colony was administered from Brussels , with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote .</s>

<s>the beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock .</s>

<s>in Inside Africa , John Gunther describes one of these , the Societe Generale , as the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the House of Morgan , Anaconda Copper , the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York , the Pennsylvania Railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the United States government as a heavy partner .</s>

<s>had they been truly ruthless , the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion .</s>

<s>but they were not .</s>

<s>they provided a social security system which covered all their African employes ;
their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent ;
they put much effort into public housing .</s>

<s>they also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food .</s>

<s>but instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month , the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often .</s>

<s>would not the children , if they received all their food on the first day of the month , eat it up immediately , and later go hungry ?</s>

<s>the Belgians also placed great emphasis on education .</s>

<s>during the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the Congo .</s>

<s>but almost all the schools were primary .</s>

<s>the average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of la chatte and le chien and write his name .</s>

<s>some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many .</s>

<s>but they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college .</s>

<s>it was their conviction that the people should be brought up together , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science .</s>

<s>indeed , the Belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest .</s>

<s>when the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates .</s>

<s>why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ?</s>

<s>in one large oversimplification , it might be said that the Belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping Africa .</s>

<s>they lacked time to prepare the Congo , as the British and French had prepared their colonies .</s>

<s>the Congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant ;
and in Brussels , street crowds shouted , pas une goutte de sang ]
( not one drop of blood ]
) .</s>

<s>the Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue ;
rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the mess .</s>

<s>it is hard to blame them for this .</s>

<s>yet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless .</s>

<s>as the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate .</s>

<s>there were four principal ones .</s>

<s>first , there were those Congolese ( among them Joseph Kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , Balkanizing it .</s>

<s>second , there were those ( Moise Tshombe ) who favored near-Balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the states .</s>

<s>third , there were those ( notably Patrice Lumumba ) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central government .</s>

<s>and fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up .</s>

<s>however shifting .</s>

<s>, the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting .</s>

<s>a a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure the Belgians for convenience in administration that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration .</s>

<s>they had divided the Congo into six .</s>

<s>they had divided the Congo into six provinces -- Leopoldville , Kasai , Kivu , Katanga , Equator and Eastern -- unfortunately with with little regard for ethnic groupings .</s>

<s>thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war .</s>

<s>the Belgian Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government : there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces .</s>

<s>well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations .</s>

<s>if internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army , the Force still officered by Publique , which had been trained and was white Belgians .</s>

<s>the president , Joseph Kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , Patrice Lumumba , a reasonable man .</s>

<s>twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other .</s>

<s>presently the well-armed members of the Force Publique many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting .</s>

<s>terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country .</s>

<s>the Belgian government decided to act , and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo .</s>

<s>on July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga , Moise Tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country .</s>

<s>confusion became chaos ;
each succeeding day brought new acts of violence .</s>

<s>Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians , and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to oust them .</s>

<s>on July 14 the Security Council -- with France and Great Britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the U.N. into the Congo .</s>

<s>vague in wording , it called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General to take the necessary steps to provide the ( Congolese ) Government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations , the national security forces may be able , in the opinion of the Government , to meet fully their tasks .</s>

<s>Secretary-General Hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the U.N. troops sent into the Congo were to come from African , or at least nonwhite , nations -- certainly not from the U.S. , Russia , Great Britain or France .</s>

<s>he quickly called on Ghana , Tunisia , Morocco , Guinea and Mali , which dispatched troops within hours .</s>

<s>ultimately the U.N. army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19,000 , including about 5,000 from India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden , who were the only whites .</s>

<s>it took the U.N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo .</s>

<s>the Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N. efforts .</s>

<s>the wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the U.N. to get out of the Congo along with the Belgians , and appealed to Russia for help .</s>

<s>( however , there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist .</s>

<s>before appealing to the U.N. or to Russia , he first appealed to the U.S. for military help , and was rejected .
)</s>

<s>Lumumba further complicated the U.N.'s mission by initiating small wars with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which , under Albert Kalonji , wanted to secede as well .</s>

<s>meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo , sending Lumumba equipment for his wars , dispatching technicians and even threatening , on occasion , to intervene openly .</s>

<s>but by the end of the three-month period , in October 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the Congo .</s>

<s>president Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and fired him .</s>

<s>with the money all but in hand , however , the Administration indicated that , instead of the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested , the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000 .</s>

<s>the hold-back , as Pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudently .</s>

<s>holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes .</s>

<s>long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward .</s>

<s>higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues .</s>

<s>result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative .</s>

<s>things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds .</s>

<s>traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing .</s>

<s>that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates .</s>

<s>as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments .</s>

<s>another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds .</s>

<s>other tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21 , according to Standard & Poor's average .</s>

<s>on balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then .</s>

<s>however , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend .</s>

<s>on these bonds , price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declines .</s>

<s>tax-free returns .</s>

<s>investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds .</s>

<s>you find the evidence of that in the chart on this page .</s>

<s>many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent , or very close to that .</s>

<s>and this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds .</s>

<s>that 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds .</s>

<s>it's not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury bonds .</s>

<s>for investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high .</s>

<s>it is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed , or for a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income .</s>

<s>swelling traffic .</s>

<s>a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in February or March -- shows what is happening .</s>

<s>the report is based on a survey by Blyth & Company , investment bankers .</s>

<s>nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period .</s>

<s>and there is the bright note : the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession .</s>

<s>many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter .</s>

<s>indication : the long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward .</s>

<s>look , for example , at the Ohio Turnpike .</s>

<s>traffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February , as compared with those same months in 1960 .</s>

<s>then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs .</s>

<s>as a result , the road's net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds .</s>

<s>that was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months .</s>

<s>that same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts Turnpike .</s>

<s>operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in March .</s>

<s>costs were held down , despite a bitter winter .</s>

<s>for the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding period .</s>

<s>the road's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston .</s>

<s>slow successes .</s>

<s>some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do .</s>

<s>the 187-mile Illinois State Toll Highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until December , 1958 .</s>

<s>in the 12 months ended in February , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves .</s>

<s>in the 12 months ended in February , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest .</s>

<s>that improvement is continuing .</s>

<s>in the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 .</s>

<s>success , for many turnpikes , has come hard .</s>

<s>traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates .</s>

<s>in these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways .</s>

<s>many rate increases already have been put into effect .</s>

<s>higher tolls are planned for July 1 , 1961 , on the Richmond-Petersburg , Va. , Turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study .</s>

<s>easier access .</s>

<s>progress is being made , too , in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes .</s>

<s>the Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration .</s>

<s>net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28 , 1961 .</s>

<s>further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas City , Kans.</s>

<s>, and Kansas City , Mo.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years .</s>

<s>for some roads , troubles .</s>

<s>investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals .</s>

<s>traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike .</s>

<s>if nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 .</s>

<s>West Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same .</s>

<s>these , however , are exceptions .</s>

<s>the typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement .</s>

<s>it's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full .</s>

<s>already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins .</s>

<s>many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point .</s>

<s>a top American official , after a look at Europe's factories , thinks the U.S. is in a very serious situation competitively .</s>

<s>Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on May 10 toured plants of two of Italy's biggest companies -- Fiat , the auto producer , and Olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating machines .</s>

<s>our staff man cabled from Turin as follows -- follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant , and you learn this : one , modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the Marshall Plan -- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a day .</s>

<s>about half of these are exported .</s>

<s>two , wage costs are a fraction of the U.S. costs .</s>

<s>a skilled worker on the assembly line , for example , earns $37 a week .</s>

<s>three , labor troubles are infrequent .</s>

<s>Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years .</s>

<s>said Secretary Hodges : it's a tough combination for the U.S. to face .</s>

<s>Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges .</s>

<s>Olivetti took over Underwood , the U.S. typewriter maker , in late 1959 .</s>

<s>within a year , without reducing wages , Underwood's production costs were cut one third , prices were slashed .</s>

<s>the result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled .</s>

<s>the Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout , modern machinery .</s>

<s>the firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious .</s>

<s>Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U.S. .</s>

<s>the inflow of foreign capital would help the U.S. balance of payments .</s>

<s>Hodges predicted : I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the U.S. .</s>

<s>there are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas .</s>

<s>foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports .</s>

<s>the recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines .</s>

<s>important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these : an international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy .</s>

<s>chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting .</s>

<s>the U.S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years .</s>

<s>point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet .</s>

<s>if they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would .</s>

<s>idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible .</s>

<s>at the same time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries .</s>

<s>Japan , since 1957 , has been voluntarily curbing exports of textiles to the U.S. .</s>

<s>Hong Kong , India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the Lancashire Pact .</s>

<s>none of these countries is happy with these arrangements .</s>

<s>the Japanese want to increase exports to the U.S. while they have been curbing shipments , they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big U.S. market .</s>

<s>Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain , while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly .</s>

<s>the Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasons .</s>

<s>the Kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that dumping practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas .</s>

<s>gradual , controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what President Kennedy wants .</s>

<s>this may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products .</s>

<s>it's an important clue to Washington thinking .</s>

<s>note , too , that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry .</s>

<s>get competitive or get out .</s>

<s>in veiled terms , that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry .</s>

<s>the Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn't seem feasible .</s>

<s>special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed .</s>

<s>government research will look into new products and methods .</s>

<s>import quotas aren't ruled out where the national interest is involved .</s>

<s>but the Kennedy Administration doesn't favor import quotas .</s>

<s>rather , they are impressed with the British Government's success in forcing -- and helping -- the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products .</s>

<s>what's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries .</s>

<s>among the highest-paid workers in the world are U.S. coal miners .</s>

<s>yet U.S. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water .</s>

<s>Steel Company of Wales , a British steelmaker , wants to bring in Virginia coal , cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets .</s>

<s>Virginia coal , delivered by ship in Wales , will be about $2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines .</s>

<s>U.S. coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freight .</s>

<s>many of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting , narrow and very deep .</s>

<s>productivity of U.S. miners is twice that of the British .</s>

<s>Welsh coal miners , Communist-led , are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American coal .</s>

<s>they threaten to strike .</s>

<s>the British Government will have to decide whether to let U.S. coal in .</s>

<s>the British coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can't sell .</s>

<s>every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , I'm sorry , but we don't have that book .</s>

<s>there wouldn't be much demand for it , I'm afraid .</s>

<s>behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest .</s>

<s>what to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ?</s>

<s>what to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ?</s>

<s>most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate .</s>

<s>a startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually , which includes the librarian's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest city .</s>

<s>the plight of a small community library is proportionately worse .</s>

<s>confronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds .</s>

<s>in some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis .</s>

<s>New York State has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow .</s>

<s>because it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the New York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works .</s>

<s>at one extreme are the systems of upper New York State , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated area .</s>

<s>at the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library System , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve .</s>

<s>both these types , and those in between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state .</s>

<s>it was a step in the right direction , but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today .</s>

<s>under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts .</s>

<s>an earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they saw fit .</s>

<s>some library boards are wary of the plan .</s>

<s>a large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great .</s>

<s>a small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board .</s>

<s>within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserved .</s>

<s>the local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system .</s>

<s>all services are given without cost to members .</s>

<s>so obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State now has access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op .</s>

<s>to set up a co-operative library system , the law requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organized around it .</s>

<s>the collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collection .</s>

<s>each system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency .</s>

<s>the basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served , and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita , if a library spends a certain number of dollars .</s>

<s>in Nassau County , for example , the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City , the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons , a figure that has doubled since 1950 .</s>

<s>this system , by virtue of its variety and size , offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation .</s>

<s>the Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area .</s>

<s>the need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate to satisfy everyday needs , could afford .</s>

<s>Nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100,000 volumes by 1965 .</s>

<s>the major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers .</s>

<s>basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local libraries .</s>

<s>on microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as well as bound volumes of important periodicals .</s>

<s>the entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans .</s>

<s>headquarters gets about 100 requests every day .</s>

<s>it is connected by teletype with the State Library in Albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide .</s>

<s>the books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries .</s>

<s>each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build upon .</s>

<s>East Meadow has philosophy , psychology , and religion ;
Freeport houses social science , pure science , and language ;
history , biography , and education are centered in Hempstead ;
Levittown has applied science , business , and literature ;
while Hewlett-Woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languages .</s>

<s>this kind of cooperation is not wholly new , of course .</s>

<s>public libraries in Nassau County have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis .</s>

<s>local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library .</s>

<s>the system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together ;

<s>in addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children's program , headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county ;
it prepares cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional material ) for use in member libraries ;

and it publishes Sum And Substance , a monthly newsletter , which reports the system's activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries .</s>

<s>in Nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools , and on adult education in general .</s>

<s>today , more than ever before , the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned .</s>

<s>we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word .</s>

<s>a fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries .</s>

<s>although progress has been made in America's system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed America .</s>

<s>the problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expand .</s>

<s>the inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition .</s>

<s>there are , for example , approximately 25,000,000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000 with inadequate service .</s>

<s>the end of Trujillo
assassination , even of a tyrant , is repulsive to men of good conscience .</s>

<s>Rafael Trujillo , the often blood-thirsty dictator of the Dominican Republic for 31 years , perhaps deserved his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history .</s>

<s>but whether the murder of El Benefactor in Ciudad Trujillo means freedom for the people of the Caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered .</s>

<s>Trujillo knew a great deal about assassination .</s>

<s>the responsibility for scores of deaths , including the abduction and murder of Jesus Maria Galindez , a professor at Columbia University in New York , has been laid at his door .</s>

<s>he had been involved in countless schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such as President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela .</s>

<s>it was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the Venezuelan government , reportedly involving the use of Dominican arms by former Venezuelan Dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez , has been uncovered and quashed .</s>

<s>the recent history of the Dominican Republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive .</s>

<s>unquestionably Trujillo did some good things for his country : he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation , attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably .</s>

<s>but the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition .</s>

<s>El Benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth .</s>

<s>the jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure .</s>

<s>he maintained amply financed lobbies in the United States and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise , and his influence extended even to Congress .</s>

<s>until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the United States had been an article of faith with Trujillo , and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character .</s>

<s>tardily the Government here came to understand how this country's own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression .</s>

<s>last year , after Trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the Caribbean , the United States and many other members of the Organization of American States broke diplomatic relations with him .</s>

<s>thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines .</s>

<s>Trujillo's dictatorship had been along conservative , right-wing lines .</s>

<s>but after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing Communist slogans .</s>

<s>there was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with Castro in Cuba , previously a bete noire to Trujillo -- thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces .</s>

<s>what comes after Trujillo is now the puzzle .</s>

<s>the Dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation , and all alternative leadership has been suppressed .</s>

<s>perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability , but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger .</s>

<s>the Dominican Republic could turn toward Communist-type authoritarianism as easily as toward Western freedom .</s>

<s>such a twist would be a tragedy for the Dominican people , who deserve to breathe without fear .</s>

<s>for that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the Dominican Republic will need the greatest sympathy and help .</s>

<s>start on rapid transit
high-speed buses on the George Washington Memorial Parkway , operating between downtown Washington and Cabin John , Glen Echo and Brookmont , would constitute an alluring sample of what the new National Capital Transportation Agency can do for this city .</s>

<s>in presenting plans for such express buses before the Montgomery County Council , the administrator of the J , C. Darwin Stolzenbach , was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching .</s>

<s>such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the J are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area .</s>

<s>because the buses would not stop on the parkway , land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed .</s>

<s>the J is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of Congress .</s>

<s>must Berlin remain divided ?</s>

<s>the inference has been too widely accepted that because the Communists have succeeded in building barricades across Berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city .</s>

<s>so far as the record is concerned , the Western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so .</s>

<s>though Walter Ulbricht , by grace of Soviet tanks , may be head man in East Germany , that does not give him any right to usurp the government of East Berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the Soviet zone .</s>

<s>the wartime protocol of September 12 , 1944 , designated a special Greater Berlin area , comprising the entire city , to be under joint occupation .</s>

<s>it was not a part of any one of the three ( later four ) zones for occupation by Soviet , American , British , and French troops respectively .</s>

<s>after the Berlin blockade and airlift , the Council of Foreign Ministers in 1949 declared a purpose to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of Germany and of Berlin .</s>

<s>for some time the Communists honored the distinction between the Soviet zone of Germany and the Soviet sector of Berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas .</s>

<s>then they moved offices of the East German puppet government into East Berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of East Germany .</s>

<s>that this and the closing of the East Berlin-West Berlin border have not been accepted by the Western governments appears in notes which Britain , France , and the United States sent to Moscow after the latter's gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor Adenauer and other West German officials to West Berlin .</s>

<s>the Chancellor had as much business there as Ulbricht had in East Berlin -- and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of Gerhard Eisler .</s>

<s>the British and other replies to that Moscow note pointed out efforts of the Communist authorities to integrate East Berlin into East Germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of East Germany .</s>

<s>they insisted on the fundamental fact that the whole of Berlin has a quadripartite status .</s>

<s>this is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact .</s>

<s>there remains , of course , the question of what the West can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts .</s>

<s>one ground of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over into West Berlin as Communist vopos try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents .</s>

<s>another remained when an American Army car was recovered but with a broken glass .</s>

<s>the glass may seem trivial but Communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed .</s>

<s>remembering the step-by-step fate of Danzig and the West German misgivings about salami tactics , it is to be hoped that the dispatch of General Clay to West Berlin as President Kennedy's representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed .</s>

<s>Prairie National Park
thousands of buffalo ( bison they will never be to the man on the street ) grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug upon the rolling , dusty-green grassland .</s>

<s>a horizon even and seamless , binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth .</s>

<s>that picture of the American prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the American continent as any later cinema image of the West made in live-oak canyons near Hollywood .</s>

<s>for it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of Americans the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the Ohio and Mississippi valleys began to fill .</s>

<s>the National Park Service now proposes to preserve an area in Pottawatomie County , northeast Kansas , as a Prairie National Park .</s>

<s>there the buffalo would roam , to be seen as a tapestry , not as moth-eaten zoo specimens .</s>

<s>wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved .</s>

<s>grasslands would extend , unfenced , unplowed , unbroken by silo or barn -- as the first settlers saw them .</s>

<s>the Park Service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new park .</s>

<s>American history should clinch the case when Congress is asked to approve .</s>

<s>whisky on the air
a Philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising on J and radio .</s>

<s>starting with small stations not members of the National Association of Broadcasters , the firm apparently is seeking to break down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations .</s>

<s>probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional action requiring the Federal Communications Commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power .</s>

<s>the National Association of Broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor commercials .</s>

<s>past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this policy .</s>

<s>even the Distilled Spirits Institute has long had a specific prohibition .</s>

<s>why , then , with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads , is it necessary to seek congressional action ?</s>

<s>simply because the subverting action of firms that are not members of the Distilled Spirits Institute and of radio and J stations that are not members of the J tends to spread .</s>

<s>soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of non-code competitors .</s>

<s>although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which J soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied , there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping Oopsie-Cola and gulling him into downing bourbon .</s>

<s>New York : Democrats' choice
registered Democrats in New York City this year have the opportunity to elect their party's candidates for Mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization .</s>

<s>in the central contest , that for Mayor , they may have found some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other .</s>

<s>Mayor Robert F. Wagner must , as his opponents demand , assume responsibility for his performance in office .</s>

<s>while all citizens share in blame for lax municipal ethics the Wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools , law enforcement and fiscal policies .</s>

<s>the Mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record .</s>

<s>State Controller Arthur Levitt , on the other hand , cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than in the city's welfare .</s>

<s>they , too , have links with the city's ills .</s>

<s>both men are known to be honest and public-spirited .</s>

<s>Mayor Wagner's shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed than those of Mr. Levitt who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post .</s>

<s>as Mayor , Mr. Levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like .</s>

<s>his election , on the other hand , would unquestionably strengthen the regulars .</s>

<s>Mr. Wagner might or might not be a new Mayor in this third term , now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls bosses .</s>

<s>these are , of course , the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote .</s>

<s>but his reelection would strengthen the liberal Democrats and the labor unions who back him .</s>

<s>if this choice is less exciting than New York Democrats may wish , it nevertheless must be made .</s>

<s>the vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party .</s>

<s>little war , big test
both Mr. J have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over Laos .</s>

<s>President Kennedy , already two quiet demands down , still refused Thursday to be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to Moscow .</s>

<s>but at the same time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the fighting .</s>

<s>and Secretary Rusk , en route to Bangkok , doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of Australian or Thai J forces .</s>

<s>for Mr. Kennedy , speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation .</s>

<s>the new President is in no position to start out his dealings with Moscow by issuing callable bluffs .</s>

<s>he must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says .</s>

<s>in this case he has put the alternatives clearly to Mr. Khrushchev for the third time .</s>

<s>at his press conference Mr. Kennedy said , all we want in Laos is peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn .</s>

<s>at the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position .</s>

<s>since Laos is of no more purely military value to Moscow itself than it is to Washington , this approach might be expected to head off Mr. Khrushchev for the moment .</s>

<s>but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in Laos , the Soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride -- a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot , but would bog Washington in a tactical mess .</s>

<s>as wars go , Laos is an extremely little one .</s>

<s>casualties have been running about a dozen men a day .</s>

<s>the hard core of the pro-Communist rebel force numbers only some 2,000 tough Viet Minh guerrilla fighters .</s>

<s>but for the United States and its J allies to attempt to shore up a less tough , less combat-tested government army in monsoon-shrouded , road-shy , guerrilla-th'-wisp terrain is a risk not savored by Pentagon planners .</s>

<s>but if anything can bring home to Mr. Khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this Braddock-against-the-Indiansjj contest , it will probably be the fact that J forces are ready to attempt it -- plus the fact that Moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with Washington .</s>

<s>fortunately both the Republicans and America's chief Western allies now are joined behind the neutral Laos aim of the President .</s>

<s>actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the British policy of seeking to achieve a neutral Laos via the international bargaining table .</s>

<s>it is ironic that Washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable .</s>

<s>the State Department tacitly rejected the neutral Laos idea after the Geneva conference of 1954 , and last year Washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral Premier Souvanna Phouma .</s>

<s>but since last fall the United States has been moving toward a pro-neutralist position and now is ready to back the British plan for a cease-fire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers .</s>

<s>the road to a guaranteed-neutral , coup-proof Laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation's terrain .</s>

<s>but for the safety of Southeast Asia , and for the sake of the Laotian people -- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting -- this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made .</s>

<s>the world awaits Mr. Khrushchev's choice of alternatives .</s>

<s>a vote for educational J

<s>the House communications subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds .</s>

<s>this year's Senate measure would provide each state and the District of Columbia with $1,000,000 to be used in support of private , state , or municipal J efforts .</s>

<s>the funds would be used for equipment , not for land , buildings , or operation .</s>

<s>the relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value .</s>

<s>but , lacking money from commercial sponsors , the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service .</s>

<s>other communities -- the ones to be aided most by the Senate bill -- have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment .</s>

<s>he was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure ;

<s>the House was his habitat and there he flourished , first as a young representative , then as a forceful committee chairman , and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth , Speaker of the House , and second most powerful man in Washington .</s>

<s>Mr. Rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label .</s>

<s>he was no flaming liberal , yet the New Deal , the Fair Deal and the New Frontier needed him .</s>

<s>he was not a rear-looking conservative , yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any .</s>

<s>two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word .</s>

<s>Sam Rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave , for he was never loquacious , and his word , once given , was not subject to retraction .</s>

<s>it might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs .</s>

<s>the demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical .</s>

<s>his leadership was not for audiences .</s>

<s>a growl , a nod , was usually enough .</s>

<s>when it was not , one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented .</s>

<s>he would rise in the well of the House , his chin upon his chest , his hands gripping the side of a desk , and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence .</s>

<s>he spoke briefly , sensibly , to the point and without oratorical flourishes .</s>

<s>he made good , plain American common sense and the House usually recognized it and acted upon it .</s>

<s>these public efforts were rare because Mr. Rayburn normally did his counseling , persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the House floor .</s>

<s>he expected Democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them .</s>

<s>with his long service he had a long memory , an excellent thing in a political leader .</s>

<s>he was , of course , in the House for a very long time .</s>

<s>there are only two men remaining in Congress who , with Rayburn , voted for the declaration of war against Germany in 1917 .</s>

<s>to almost two generations of Americans it must have seemed as though the existence of Mr. Sam coincided with that of the House .</s>

<s>and it was the House he loved .</s>

<s>to be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition .</s>

<s>the Senate to him was not the upper body and he corrected those who said he served under the president .</s>

<s>he served with him .</s>

<s>sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death .</s>

<s>Woodrow Wilson , with whom he began his years in Washington , Warren G. Harding , Calvin Coolidge , J , with whom he managed a social revolution .</s>

<s>and those still with us , Herbert C. Hoover , Harry S. Truman , Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy .</s>

<s>he was a fighter for those of his own party .</s>

<s>Mr. Truman has only to recall the hopeless campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of Mr. Kennedy with Congress would have been sadder than it was had not Mr. Sam been there .</s>

<s>as it was , his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration .</s>

<s>with Republican presidents , he fought fair .</s>

<s>he was his own man , not an automatic obstructionist .</s>

<s>he kept his attacks on Republicanism for partisan campaigns , but that is part of the game he was born to play .</s>

<s>under any name -- Mr. Speaker , Mr. Democrat , Mr. Sam -- he was a good man .</s>

<s>J off the Congo track
thirteen Italian airmen who went to the Congo to serve the cause of peace under the United Nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of Congolese troops supposedly their friends .</s>

<s>in 18 months , no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle .</s>

<s>simply out of bloodlust , their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river .</s>

<s>the excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries .</s>

<s>in other words , atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned , had the victims been serving the cause of dissident Katanga .</s>

<s>does this suggest that the Congo is fit for nationhood or that J is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it ?</s>

<s>to the contrary , through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence .</s>

<s>mass rapes , troop mutinies , uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures , given no sanction by any political authority , have become almost daily occurrences .</s>

<s>yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of Katanga .</s>

<s>it happens in the territory of the Leopoldville government , which is itself a fiction , demonstrably incapable of governing , and commanding only such limited credit abroad as J support gives it .</s>

<s>the main question raised by the incident is how much longer will J bury its head in the sand on the Congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms ?</s>

<s>the probable answer is that it will do so just as long as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on Central Africa .</s>

<s>right now , they are pushing a resolution which would have J use its forces to invade and subjugate Katanga .</s>

<s>that notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several points of view .</s>

<s>the J army is too weak , too demoralized for the task .</s>

<s>further , it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned .</s>

<s>last , it makes no sense to deliver Katanga , the one reasonably solid territory , into the existing chaos .</s>

<s>the Congo should have been mandated , because it was not ready for independence .</s>

<s>the idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom .</s>

<s>it is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism .</s>

<s>but if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the General Assembly , it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach .</s>

<s>featherbed reversal
a recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement reached between the Southern Pacific Co. and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information .</s>

<s>the editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year .</s>

<s>our comment was that this was featherbedding in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement .</s>

<s>the statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers , but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life .</s>

<s>additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need .</s>

<s>also , normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic .</s>

<s>the situation with regard to the Southern Pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries .</s>

<s>the solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands .</s>

<s>meditations from a fallout shelter
time was when the house of delegates of the American Bar association leaned to the common sense side .</s>

<s>but the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar , and when the lads met in St. Louis , it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the United Nations was scarcely less than wonderful , despite an imperfection here and there .</s>

<s>it was , the brief writers decided , man's best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world .</s>

<s>peace , it's wonderful , and world law , it's wonderful , too , and shouldn't we get an international covenant extending it into space , before the Russians put some claim jumper on the moon ?</s>

<s>meanwhile , in Moscow , Khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of J , to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can't see the justice of surrendering West Berlin to communism .</s>

<s>a nuclear pacifier of these dimensions -- roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the United States has triggered experimentally -- would certainly produce a bigger bang , and , just for kicks , Khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from St. Louis to the moon , where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink .</s>

<s>while he was at it , the philosopher of the Kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide .</s>

<s>fools , he bayed , what do you think you are doing ?</s>

<s>the only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't playing the marimba with our shoes in the United Nations , but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort .</s>

<s>another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from Mexico City with the daily hijacking of an American plane by a demented Algerian with a gun .</s>

<s>the craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to Havana , where , for some unknown reason , Castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian foreign minister , a passenger , who is not an admirer of old Ten O'Clock Shadow .</s>

<s>the plane was sent back to the United States , for a change , but Castro kept the crazy gunman , who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution .</s>

<s>less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by Castro's right hand man , Che Guevara , who edified the Inter-American Economic and Social council meeting in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents purloined from the United States embassy at Caracas , Venezuela .</s>

<s>the contents were highly embarrassing to American spokesmen , who were on hand to promise Latin Americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium .</s>

<s>perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing American diplomatic papers and planes , but the Kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that , but for its own incompetence in protecting American interests , these things would not happen .</s>

<s>the same can be said about the half-hearted Cuban invasion mounted by the administration last April , which , we trust , is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious Khrushchev .</s>

<s>the board of suspension of the Interstate Commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain , as they had planned to do this month .</s>

<s>a shock wave from Africa
word of Dag Hammarskjold's death in an African plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe .</s>

<s>it was on the eve of a momentous U.N. session to come to grips with cold war issues .</s>

<s>his firm hand will be desperately missed .</s>

<s>Mr. Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace .</s>

<s>he had sought talks with Moise Tshombe , the secessionist president of Congo's Katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody .</s>

<s>he earnestly urged a cease-fire .</s>

<s>the story of the fatal crash is not fully known .</s>

<s>the U.N.-chartered plane which was flying from the conference city of Ndola in Northern Rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired .</s>

<s>whether this , or overt action , was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined .</s>

<s>the death of Mr. Hammarskjold removes the United Nations' most controversial leader .</s>

<s>he was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice .</s>

<s>he courageously defended the rights of small nations , and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the Communist bloc .</s>

<s>the Congo , in whose cause he died , was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs .</s>

<s>his policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war and workable solutions were beginning to take shape .</s>

<s>monument to togetherness
reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long been one of Greater Miami's hardest tasks .</s>

<s>too many have bogged down in bickering .</s>

<s>even when public bodies arrived at a consensus , at least one dissenting vote has been usual .</s>

<s>so we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity .</s>

<s>all nine members of the Inter-American Center Authority voted for Goodbody & Company's proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center .</s>

<s>the widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms of its contract .</s>

<s>if the indenture is accepted , the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue .</s>

<s>then Goodbody will hand over a minimum of $15.5 million for developing the spacious Graves Tract to house the center .</s>

<s>the next step awaits approval today by the Metro commissioners as the members of the Dade County Port Authority .</s>

<s>they allotted $500,000 three years ago to support Interama until its own financing could be arranged .</s>

<s>less than half the sum has been spent , since the Interama board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking negotiations .</s>

<s>the balance is being budgeted for the coming year .</s>

<s>unanimity on Interama is not surprising .</s>

<s>it is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed .</s>

<s>the City of Miami recently yielded a prior claim of $8.5 million on the Graves Tract to clear the way for the project .</s>

<s>a short report and a good one

<s>each state advisory committee documented its own activity .</s>

<s>some accounts are quite lengthy but Florida's is the shortest of all , requiring only four paragraphs .</s>

<s>the established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continued in all areas , reported this group headed by Harold Colee of Jacksonville and including two South Floridians , William D. Singer and John B. Turner of Miami .</s>

<s>no complaints or charges have been filed during the past year , either verbally or written , from any individual or group .</s>

<s>the committee continues to feel that Florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights .</s>

<s>problems have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most cases with understanding and restraint .</s>

<s>the progress reported by the advisory committee is real .</s>

<s>while some think we move too fast and others too slowly , Florida's record is a good one and stands out among the 50 .</s>

<s>West Germany remains
Western West Germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead , on Berlin and unification , with a coalition government .</s>

<s>this is the key fact emerging from Sunday's national election .</s>

<s>Chancellor Adenauer's Christian Democratic Party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute Bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957 .</s>

<s>in order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength .</s>

<s>inevitably this means some compromise .</s>

<s>the aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired .</s>

<s>both Willy Brandt's Social Democrats , who gained 22 seats in the new parliament , and the Free Democrats , who picked up 23 , will insist on that before they enter the government .</s>

<s>moon-faced Ludwig Erhart , the economic expert , probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him .</s>

<s>if he becomes chancellor , Dr. Erhart would make few changes .</s>

<s>the wizard who fashioned West Germany's astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise .</s>

<s>he is dedicated to building the nation's strength and , as are all West Germans , to a free Berlin and to reunion with captive East Germany .</s>

<s>what is in doubt as the free Germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result .</s>

<s>if the party of Adenauer and Erhart , with 45 per cent of the vote , approaches the party of Willy Brandt , which won 36 per cent , the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve .</s>

<s>West Berlin's Mayor Brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and won votes by it .</s>

<s>the Free Democrats ( 12 per cent of the vote ) believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the Soviet Union , and more dealings with the Communist bloc .</s>

<s>the question left by the election is whether West Germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility .</s>

<s>it could go either way , since the gains for both points of view were about the same .</s>

<s>regardless of the decision two facts are clear .</s>

<s>West Germany , with its industrial and military might , reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the free nations .</s>

<s>and the career of Konrad Adenauer , who upheld Germany's tradition of rock-like leaders which Bismarck began , draws near the end .</s>

<s>better ask before joining
Americans are a nation of joiners , a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing .</s>

<s>but it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't want to make a spectacle of himself .</s>

<s>for instance , so-called conservative organizations , some of them secret , are sprouting in the garden of joining where liberal organizations once took root .</s>

<s>one specific example is a secret fraternity which will coordinate anti-Communist efforts .</s>

<s>the principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled .</s>

<s>according to The Chicago Tribune News Service , State Atty.</s>

<s>Gen. Stanley Mosk of California has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name : 1 .</s>

<s>does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations ?</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>does it attack other traditional American institutions with unsupportable and wild charges ?</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>does it put the label of un-American or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically ?</s>

<s>4 .</s>

<s>does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming American statesmen for wars , Communism , depression , and other troubles of the world ?</s>

<s>5 .</s>

<s>does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns ?</s>

<s>6 .</s>

<s>do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate ?</s>

<s>in some instances a seventh question can be added : 7 .</s>

<s>does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government , political party or personality in opposition or preference to the American system ?</s>

<s>if the would-be joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of Americans in a troubled time .</s>

<s>falling somewhere in a category between Einstein's theory and sand fleas -- difficult to see but undeniably there , nevertheless -- is the tropical green city of Islandia , a string of offshore islands that has almost no residents , limited access and an unlimited future .</s>

<s>the latter is what concerns us all .</s>

<s>whatever land you can see here , from the North tip end of Elliott Key looking southward , belongs to someone -- people who have title to the land .</s>

<s>and what you can't see , the land underneath the water , belongs to someone , too .</s>

<s>the public .</s>

<s>the only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment .</s>

<s>in the fairly brief but hectic history of Florida , the developers of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours .</s>

<s>in this instance , happily , insistence is being made that our share is protected .</s>

<s>and until this protection is at least as concrete as , say , the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at Miami Beach , those who represent us all should agree to nothing .</s>

<s>closed doors in city hall
the reaction of certain City Council members to California's newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing .</s>

<s>we had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide , and , therefore , had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public .</s>

<s>in the preamble to the open-meeting statutes , collectively known as the Brown Act , the Legislature declares that the public commissions , boards and councils and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business .</s>

<s>it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly .</s>

<s>the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them .</s>

<s>the people , in delegating authority , do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know .</s>

<s>the full implementation of these noble words , however , has taken the efforts of five sessions of the Legislature .</s>

<s>since 1953 California has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted , but not until this year did the lawmakers in Sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the Brown Act .</s>

<s>despite the lip service paid by local governments , the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations .</s>

<s>when all else fails , it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations .</s>

<s>we submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law -- and one of its principal aims .</s>

<s>without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily .</s>

<s>but the citizens would , of course , never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious .</s>

<s>help when needed
if the Dominican Republic achieves free , democratic government , it will be due in large part to the U.S. show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of Trujillo dictatorship .</s>

<s>outwardly , Ciudad Trujillo is calm .</s>

<s>none of the Trujillo family remains .</s>

<s>Mr. Balaguer is in control , and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring .</s>

<s>had U.S. warships not appeared off the Dominican coast , there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war .</s>

<s>ultimately either the Trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by Dominican elements responsive to Castro in Cuba .</s>

<s>within the Organization of American States , there may be some criticism of this unilateral American intervention which was not without risk obviously .</s>

<s>but there was no complaint from the Dominican crowds which lined Ciudad Trujillo's waterfront shouting , vive Yankees ]
more , the U.S. action was hailed by a principal opposition leader , Dr. Juan Bosch , as having saved many lives and many troubles in the near future .</s>

<s>Mr. Balaguer's troubles are by no means over .</s>

<s>he will need the help of all J members to eradicate , finally , the forces of authoritarianism , pro-Trujillo and pro-Castro alike .</s>

<s>in cooperating toward that objective , J might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the United States .</s>

<s>matter of survival
those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935 .</s>

<s>now , as then , it is a matter of jobs .</s>

<s>craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim , such as factory maintenance .</s>

<s>the issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the American Federation of Labor of its industrial union members .</s>

<s>that breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations .</s>

<s>or that's what it looked like at the time .</s>

<s>but automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs .</s>

<s>Walter Reuther , leader of the industrial union faction of the J , says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all American labor .</s>

<s>whether it could be as disastrous for American labor as , say , Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters , is a matter of conjecture .</s>

<s>but the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for labor .</s>

<s>engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival , this country can have little patience with labor's family feuds .</s>

<s>the concept of labor as a special class is outmoded , and in the task confronting America as bastion of the free world , labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive .</s>

<s>deterrent
the Army , Navy and Air Force , among others , may question Secretary Freeman's claim that the high estate of United States agriculture is the strongest deterrent to the spread of communism .</s>

<s>but the secretary insists that the success of the American farmer is the greatest single source of strength in the struggle to insure freedom around the world .</s>

<s>Mr. Freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by America's capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production -- or even by the Soviet's successes in space .</s>

<s>this shouldn't surprise the secretary ;
American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long , long time .</s>

<s>in fact , over the years , the American farmer's capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar .</s>

<s>and thus far , Mr. Freeman has offered very little relief .</s>

<s>the 1961 feed grain program , which the secretary sponsored , has been declared a billion dollar fiasco .</s>

<s>in exchange for higher price supports , growers pledged reduction in planted acreage .</s>

<s>but the farmers outsmarted Washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer .</s>

<s>the result : $1.1 billion added to the deficit in the federal budget .</s>

<s>perhaps , as Mr. Freeman says , American agriculture may stop the Communists , but it is also swindling the American taxpayer .</s>

<s>what's wrong at state
a senate subcommittee headed by Sen. Jackson of Washington has been going over the State Department and has reached some predictable conclusions .</s>

<s>the department needs a clearer sense of direction at the top and it needs fewer , but better , people , Sen. Jackson says .</s>

<s>the subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department .</s>

<s>President Kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance .</s>

<s>but those who would revitalize so complex an organization must , first of all , overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures , suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes .</s>

<s>nor does Sen. Jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the White House of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy .</s>

<s>this tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for Secretary Rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates .</s>

<s>but competent observers believe he is making progress , particularly toward what Sen. Jackson lists as the primary need -- a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them .</s>

<s>the Jackson report will provide some of the political support Mr. Rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged , as Sen. Jackson puts it , in work that does not really need doing .</s>

<s>Mr. Rusk should also draw comfort from Sen. Jackson's recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved .</s>

<s>self-criticism is a rare but needed commodity in Congress .</s>

<s>betting men
forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist .</s>

<s>but now apparently the job of Secretary of Labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends .</s>

<s>James P. Mitchell , when he was the head of the department , promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop below three million a couple of years ago .</s>

<s>he lost , but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora .</s>

<s>his successor , Secretary Goldberg , also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months .</s>

<s>no betting man , Mr. Goldberg says he's merely putting my neck out again by predicting the rate will go down this month .</s>

<s>he is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride -- a new record high in personal income , an increase in housing starts , a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods .</s>

<s>Mr. Mitchell had an excuse for losing -- the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated .</s>

<s>Mr. Goldberg has less reason for missing .</s>

<s>the economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they can't be blamed in November .</s>

<s>the odds thus appear favorable that the secretary's neck may be spared .</s>

<s>little resistance
Cambodia's chief of state , who has been accused of harboring Communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring South Viet Nam and Thailand , insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in Southeast Asia .</s>

<s>but so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph is Prince Sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel .</s>

<s>I have to see the facts , is the way the prince puts it .</s>

<s>and from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-Western posture .</s>

<s>Prince Sihanouk's powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions .</s>

<s>bottom sighted
Commerce Secretary Hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official Washington's economic forecasters .</s>

<s>weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the Cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement .</s>

<s>recently Treasury Secretary Dillon and Labor Secretary Goldberg fell into line with Mr. Hodges' appraisal , though there has been some reluctance to do so at the White House .</s>

<s>and now Mr. Hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point .</s>

<s>he is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump .</s>

<s>the secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales .</s>

<s>February's volume was 1 per cent above January's for the first pickup since last October , although it's still 1.5 per cent off from February 1960 .</s>

<s>corroborating Mr. Hodges' figures was the Federal Reserve Board's report of the large sales increase in the nation's department stores for the week ending March 4 .</s>

<s>in Newark , for example , this gain was put at 26 per cent above the year-earlier level .</s>

<s>of course , some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that Easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960 .</s>

<s>another optimistic sign , this one from the Labor Department , was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments was interrupted for the first time in the week ending Feb. 25 .</s>

<s>initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8,100 in the week ending March 4 .</s>

<s>Mr. Hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes .</s>

<s>well , we can't have everything .</s>

<s>prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut .</s>

<s>in New
Jersey , too
New Jersey folk need not be told of the builder's march to the sea , for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that remain .</s>

<s>now the Stone Harbor bird sanctuary , 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons , is threatened , but the battlefront extends far beyond our state .</s>

<s>against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of 30 miles of Cape Cod shoreline , the tiny tract at Stone Harbor may seem unimportant .</s>

<s>but Interior Secretary Udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves .</s>

<s>the move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30,000 acres of Cape Cod , from Provincetown to Chatham , is strengthened by President Kennedy's interest in that area .</s>

<s>but preservation of the natural beauty of the Cape is of more than regional concern , for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country .</s>

<s>by comparison , Stone Harbor bird sanctuary's allies seem less formidable , for aside from the Audubon Society , they are mostly the snowy , common and cattle egrets and the Louisiana , green , little blue and black-crowned herons who nest and feed there .</s>

<s>but there is hope , for Conservation Commissioner Bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space .</s>

<s>the desirability of preserving such places as the Cape dunes and Stone Harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year .</s>

<s>public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing .</s>

<s>but that heritage is shrinking even faster .</s>

<s>no joyride
much of the glamor President Kennedy's Peace Corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by Sargent Shriver , the head corpsman .</s>

<s>anybody who is expecting a joyride should , according to Mr. Shriver , get off the train right now .</s>

<s>first of all , the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling .</s>

<s>it will be a 16-hour training day .</s>

<s>then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet , culture , language and living conditions will be different .</s>

<s>and the pay , of course , will be nil .</s>

<s>despite all this , the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else .</s>

<s>the study of the St. Louis area's economic prospects prepared for the Construction Industry Joint Conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the Metropolitan St. Louis Survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the Missouri-Illinois countryside .</s>

<s>St. Louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing and in some places stagnant mid-continent region .</s>

<s>slackened regional demand for St. Louis goods and services reflects the region's relative lack of purchasing power .</s>

<s>not all St. Louis industries , of course , have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood .</s>

<s>but for those which do , the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core .</s>

<s>the city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate Missouri and Southern Illinois .</s>

<s>Gov.</s>

<s>Dalton's New Commerce and Industry Commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry .</s>

<s>that is one approach .</s>

<s>another would be to take the advice of Dr. Elmer Ellis , president of the University of Missouri , and provide for an impartial professional analysis of Missouri's economy .</s>

<s>he says the state , in order to proceed with economic development , must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy .</s>

<s>the research center of the University's School of Business and Public Administration is prepared to undertake the analysis Dr. Ellis has been talking about .</s>

<s>he and Dean John W. Schwada of the Business School outlined the project at a recent conference .</s>

<s>the University can make a valuable contribution to the state's economic development through such a study .</s>

<s>in Southern Illinois , the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth .</s>

<s>the Carbondale Industrial Development Corp. has obtained a $500,000 loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs .</s>

<s>Carbondale is in the Herrin-Murphysboro-West Frankfort labor market , where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average .</s>

<s>the Federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on Missouri's depressed areas , and in the long run that will benefit St. Louis as well .</s>

<s>politics-ridden St. Clair county in Illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development .</s>

<s>more industrial acreage lies vacant in St. Clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the St. Louis area .</s>

<s>the unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the East Side .</s>

<s>and then there is St. Louis county , where the Democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning , of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth .</s>

<s>St. Louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform , and permitted parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests .</s>

<s>some plant-location specialists take these signs to mean St. Louis county doesn't want industry , and so they avoid the area , and more jobs are lost .</s>

<s>metropolitan St. Louis's relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political , business , civic and other leaders on both sides of the Mississippi .</s>

<s>without a great acceleration in the metropolitan area's economy , there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters , and St. Louis will slip into second-class status .</s>

<s>an excess of zeal

<s>still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far .</s>

<s>take , for example , the reformers among New York City's Democrats .</s>

<s>having whipped Mr. De Sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of Tammany Hall , they have changed the name to Chatham Hall .</s>

<s>even though headquarters actually have been moved into the Chatham building , do they believe that they can make the new name stick ?</s>

<s>granted that the Tammany name and the Tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame , the sachems of the Hall also have a few good marks to their credit .</s>

<s>but it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the Tammany name .</s>

<s>after all , it goes back to the days in which sedition was not un-American , the days in which the Sons of St. Tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force and violence -- the British government , that is .</s>

<s>further , do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo ?</s>

<s>they will -- when they give up the donkey and the elephant .</s>

<s>instead of attempting the impossible , why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger's stripes are not black ?</s>

<s>that might go over .</s>

<s>the Faget case
the White House itself has taken steps to remove a former Batista official , Col. Mariano Faget , from his preposterous position as interrogator of Cuban refugees for the Immigration Service .</s>

<s>the Faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds .</s>

<s>the Kennedy Administration had assured anti-Castro Cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of Dictator Batista .</s>

<s>using a Batista man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose Castro .</s>

<s>moreover , Col. Faget's information on Cuba was too outdated to be useful in screening Castro agents ;
the Colonel fled to the friendly haven of the Dominican dictatorship as soon as Castro seized power .</s>

<s>and while he had headed Batista's anti-Communist section , the Batista regime did not disturb the Communists so much as more open opponents who were alleged to be Communists .</s>

<s>responsibility for the Faget appointment rests with Gen. J. M. Swing , an Eisenhower appointee as head of the Immigration Service .</s>

<s>Gen.</s>

<s>Swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office .</s>

<s>his official term expired last summer .</s>

<s>some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend , Congressman Walter of Pennsylvania , at a moment when the Kennedy Administration was diligently searching for all the House votes it could get .</s>

<s>Congressman Walter has been all-powerful in immigration matters , but he has announced plans to retire in 1962 .</s>

<s>at that point the Administration will have little reason to hang onto Gen.</s>

<s>Swing .</s>

<s>the Faget case was the kind of salvage job the Administration should not have to repeat .</s>

<s>Mr. Eisenhower , politician
as President , Dwight D. Eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics .</s>

<s>as a former President , however , Mr. Eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during a New York Republican rally , and generally missed his target .</s>

<s>Mr. Eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a Peace Corps girl in Nigeria to attack the entire Corps as a juvenile experiment and to suggest sending a Corps member to the moon .</s>

<s>this was juvenile ridicule .</s>

<s>nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the Corps or its welcome reception abroad .</s>

<s>his words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding .</s>

<s>the former President blithely ignored recent history in speaking of dollarette dollars under Kennedy Administration fiscal policies .</s>

<s>it was the Eisenhower Administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit .</s>

<s>finally , Mr. Eisenhower found nothing but confusion in Washington .</s>

<s>this statement recalls the 1959 Berlin crisis , when President Eisenhower first told reporters that Berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too .</s>

<s>the crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded .</s>

<s>ex-Presidents , relieved of accountability for policy , sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words .</s>

<s>some of former President Truman's off-the-cuff discourses have been in that vein .</s>

<s>nobody can deny the right of former Chief Executives to take part in politics , but the American people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility .</s>

<s>this is a matter of respect for the Presidency .</s>

<s>Mr. Eisenhower's New York speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship .</s>

<s>queen of the seas
the Queen Mary has long been a symbol of speed , luxury , and impeccable British service on the high seas .</s>

<s>reports that the venerable liner , which has been in service since 1936 , was to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us .</s>

<s>but the Cunard line , influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment , has decided to keep the Queen Mary in service until next Spring at least .</s>

<s>a new queen , with the prosaic title of J , had been planned for several years to replace the Queen Mary .</s>

<s>the British government , concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry , had put through a bill to give Cunard loans and grants totaling $50,400,000 toward the $84,000,000 cost of a new 75,000-ton passenger liner .</s>

<s>since 1957 , more and more trans-Atlantic passengers have been crossing by air .</s>

<s>economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines .</s>

<s>competition from other steamship lines has cut Cunard's share of sea passengers from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the Atlantic run .</s>

<s>the Cunard line has under consideration replacing the Queen Mary with a ship smaller than 75,000 tons .</s>

<s>this would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months .</s>

<s>also under consideration is an increased investment in Cunard Eagle Airways which has applied to serve New York .</s>

<s>the decline of the Cunard line from its position of dominance in Atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation .</s>

<s>mission to Viet Nam
Gen. Maxwell Taylor's statement in Saigon that he is very much encouraged about the chances of the pro-Western government of Viet Nam turning back Communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatching United States troops to bolster the Vietnamese Army .</s>

<s>Gen. Taylor will report to President Kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to South Viet Nam and , judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the Far East , he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of Vietnamese military , economic , political and other resources .</s>

<s>there was good reason for Gen. Taylor to make an inspection trip at this time .</s>

<s>Communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their activities and the great flood of the Mekong River has interposed a new crisis .</s>

<s>South Viet Nam's rice surplus for next year -- more than 300,000 tons -- may have been destroyed .</s>

<s>the Viet Cong , the Communist rebels , may have lost their stored grain and arms factories .</s>

<s>the rebels may try to seize what is left of the October harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon ends in November .</s>

<s>nothing that is likely to happen , however , should prompt the sending of United States soldiers for other than instructional missions .</s>

<s>the Indochina struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954 , when Gen. Ridgway estimated it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win a war the French were losing .</s>

<s>it is a war to stay out of today , especially in view of the fact that President Ngo Dinh Diem apparently does not want United States troops .</s>

<s>he may want additional technical help , and this should be forthcoming .</s>

<s>South Viet Nam has received $1,450,000,000 in United States aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been stepped up since Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson's visit last May .</s>

<s>Gen. Taylor , the President's special military adviser , is a level-headed officer who is not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure .</s>

<s>it is probable that his recommendations will be informed and workable , and that they will not lead to involving the United States in an Asian morass .</s>

<s>Gov.</s>

<s>John M. Dalton , himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government , spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the Missouri General Assembly , or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the government and who are retained , not because of their legal talents , but because of their government influence .</s>

<s>the U.N's gravest crisis
Ambassador Stevenson yesterday described the U.N.'s problem of electing a temporary successor to the late Dag Hammarskjold as the gravest crisis the institution has faced .</s>

<s>of course it is .</s>

<s>if the decision goes wrong , it may be -- as Mr. Stevenson fears -- the first step on the slippery path downhill to a U.N. without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning .</s>

<s>the integrity of the office not merely requires that the Secretary General shall be , as the Charter puts it , the chief administrative officer of the Organization , but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority external to the Organization .</s>

<s>in other words , the Secretary General is to be a nonpartisan , international servant , not a political , national one .</s>

<s>he should be , as Dag Hammarskjold certainly was , a citizen of the world .</s>

<s>the Charter does stipulate that due regard shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible .</s>

<s>the United States and its allies have had no objection to this .</s>

<s>what they have objected to is the attempt of the Russians to make use of the tragedy of Dag Hammarskjold's death to turn the entire U.N. staff from the Secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come .</s>

<s>the controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the Secretary General and , more particularly , around the nature of his relationship with them .</s>

<s>although the United States and the U.S.S.R. have been arguing whether there shall be four , five or six top assistants , the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work .</s>

<s>if any one of them has any power to veto the Secretary General's decisions the nature of the organization will have changed .</s>

<s>if they give him advice when he asks it , or if they perform specified duties under his direction , the nature of the U. N. will not of necessity change .</s>

<s>the Secretary General must have , subject to the constitutional direction of the Security Council and the General Assembly , the power to act , to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone else's instructions .</s>

<s>this is the root issue for which the United States should stand .</s>

<s>we should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography .</s>

<s>what we must have , if the United Nations is to survive , is as nonpolitical , nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it , subject to no single nation's direction and subservient to no single nation's ambition .</s>

<s>what the new charter does
the new City Charter , which should get a Yes vote as Question No.</s>

<s>1 on Nov. 7 , would not make a good Mayor out of a bad one .</s>

<s>there is no such magic in man-made laws .</s>

<s>but it would greatly strengthen any Mayor's executive powers , remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the Board of Estimate , increase his budget-making authority both as to expense and capital budgets , and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy .</s>

<s>lawmaking power is removed from the Board of Estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the City Council and the Mayor .</s>

<s>thus there is a clearer division of authority , administrative and legislative .</s>

<s>the board is diminished in both respects , while it retains control over zoning , franchises , pier leases , sale , leasing and assignment of property , and other trusteeship functions .</s>

<s>the board will be able to increase , decrease , add or eliminate budget items , subject to the Mayor's veto ;
but the City Council will now share fully this budget-altering power .</s>

<s>overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and Council , and a two-thirds vote .</s>

<s>the Controller retains his essential fiscal watchdog functions ;
his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed .</s>

<s>he loses now-misplaced tax collection duties , which go to the Finance Department .</s>

<s>on net balance , in spite of Controller Gerosa's opposition to the new Charter as an invasion of his office , the Controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now .</s>

<s>Borough Presidents , while retaining membership in the Board of Estimate , lose their housekeeping functions .</s>

<s>highways go to a new Department of Highways , sewers to the Department of Public Works , such street cleaning as Borough Presidents now do ( in Queens and Richmond ) to the Sanitation Department .</s>

<s>some fiscal changes are important .</s>

<s>the expense ( operating ) budget is to be a program budget , and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy ( with the Mayor approving ) in fund transfers within a department .</s>

<s>the capital budget , for construction of permanent improvements , becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises ;
but , as a second-look safeguard , each new project must undergo a Board of Estimate public hearing before construction proceeds .</s>

<s>a road block to desirable local or borough improvements , heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress , is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected .</s>

<s>this will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business ;
it will also correct some injustices .</s>

<s>enlargement of the City Council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow .</s>

<s>Inter-american Press
the Inter-american Press Association , which blankets the Western Hemisphere from northern Canada to Cape Horn , is meeting in New York City this week for the first time in eleven years .</s>

<s>the I.</s>

<s>A. P. A. is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere ;
and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the Cuban revolution .</s>

<s>as the press in Cuba was gradually throttled by the Castro regime , more and more Cuban publishers , editors and correspondents were forced into exile .</s>

<s>the I.</s>

<s>A. P. A. found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall of the Castro Government and the return of the Cuban press to the freedom it knew before Batista's dictatorship began in 1952 .</s>

<s>freedom of the press was lost in Cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances .</s>

<s>in such conditions all freedoms are lost .</s>

<s>this , in more diplomatic language , is what Adlai Stevenson told the newspaper men of Latin America yesterday on behalf of the United States Government .</s>

<s>he felt able to end on a note of hope .</s>

<s>he sees evidence of fair winds for the ten-year Alliance for Progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms .</s>

<s>no group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the Inter-American Press Association .</s>

<s>meeting in Moscow
the Twenty-second Soviet Communist Party Congress opens in Moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced .</s>

<s>according to the original program , Premier Khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the Kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration or rage -- depending upon individual or national politics -- because of the bold program for building communism in our time which the Congress will adopt .</s>

<s>but far from being concerned about whether or not Russia will have achieved Utopia by 1980 , the world is watching Moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear Armageddon in the immediate future .</s>

<s>the evident contradiction between the rosy picture of Russia's progress painted by the Communist party's program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by Premier Khrushchev's Berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that the program may be severely altered .</s>

<s>whether it is or not , the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated .</s>

<s>and there must be many Soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for 1980 they and their children must first survive .</s>

<s>this Congress will see Premier Khrushchev consolidating his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years .</s>

<s>the widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among Communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the Congress , and the Central Committee it will elect , will all have passed the tightest possible Khrushchev screening , both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job .</s>

<s>Dr. Conant's call to action
Dr. James B. Conant has earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer .</s>

<s>his earlier reports considered the American public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change .</s>

<s>now , a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities , including New York , has shattered this optimism .</s>

<s>Dr. Conant has come away shocked and angry .</s>

<s>his new book , entitled Slums And Suburbs , calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster .</s>

<s>there is room for disagreement concerning some of Dr. Conant's
specific views .</s>

<s>his strong opposition to the transfer of Negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood , in the interest of integration , will be attacked by Negro leaders who have fought for , and achieved , this open or permissive enrollment .</s>

<s>Dr. Conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality .</s>

<s>his suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical , law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges themselves -- even though what he is recommending is already taking shape as a trend .</s>

<s>but these are side issues to a powerful central theme .</s>

<s>that theme cuts through hypocrisies , complacency and double-talk .</s>

<s>it labels the slums , especially the Negro slums , as dead-end streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters .</s>

<s>the villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters , and Dr. Conant accuses employers and labor unions alike .</s>

<s>the facts , he adds , are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the schools , regardless of the color of their students .</s>

<s>a call for action before it is too late has alarming implications when it comes from a man who , in his previous reports on the schools , cautioned so strongly against extreme measures .</s>

<s>these warnings must not be treated lightly .</s>

<s>Dr. Conant's
conscientious , selfless efforts deserve the nation's gratitude .</s>

<s>he has served in positions of greater glamour , both at home and abroad ;
but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public schools .</s>

<s>and now -- more junk mail
a fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail .</s>

<s>he was delighted to learn that the Post Office Department is now going to expand this service to deliver mail from Representatives in Congress to their constituents without the use of stamps , names , addresses or even zone numbers .</s>

<s>in accordance with legislation passed at the last session of Congress , each Representative is authorized to deliver to the Post Office in bulk newsletters , speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district .</s>

<s>this means an added burden to innumerable postmen , who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay , and it presumably means an increased postal deficit , but , our correspondent writes , think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis .</s>

<s>our creditors do not forget us
letter writing is a dying art .</s>

<s>occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another , but these are mostly typewritten .</s>

<s>most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly be called a letter .</s>

<s>old , tired , trembling the woman came to the cannery .</s>

<s>she had , she said , heard that the plant was closing .</s>

<s>it couldn't close , she said .</s>

<s>she had raised a calf , grown it beef-fat .</s>

<s>she had , with her own work-weary hands , put seeds in the ground , watched them sprout , bud , blossom , and get ready to bear .</s>

<s>she was ready to kill the beef , dress it out , and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup , broth , hash , and stew against the winter .</s>

<s>she had done it last year , and the year before , and the year before that , and she , and her people were dependent upon these cans for food .</s>

<s>this did not happen in counties of North Georgia , where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land .</s>

<s>nor in South Georgia , where the summer sun shines warmly and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields .</s>

<s>this happened in Decatur , DeKalb County , not 10 miles from the heart of metropolitian Atlanta .</s>

<s>and now , the woman , tired and trembling , came here to the DeKalb County cannery .</s>

<s>is it so the cannery is going to close ?</s>

<s>O. N. Moss , 61 , tall , grey as a possum , canning plant chief since 1946 , didn't know what to say .</s>

<s>he did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer .</s>

<s>he did say he was out of cans , the No.</s>

<s>3's , but I requisitioned 22,000 .</s>

<s>he said he had No.</s>

<s>2's enough to last two weeks more .</s>

<s>threat of closing the cannery is a recent one .</s>

<s>a three-man committee has recommended to Commission Chairman Charles O. Emmerich that the DeKalb County cannery be closed .</s>

<s>reason : the cannery loses $3,000 yearly .</s>

<s>but DeKalb citizens , those who use the facilities of the cannery , say the cannery is not supposed to make any money .</s>

<s>the cannery , said Mrs. Lewellyn Lundeen , an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of 1941 , to handle the victory garden produce , is a service to the taxpayer .</s>

<s>and one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat , to plant , grow vegetables and put them up .</s>

<s>it helps those people who help themselves .</s>

<s>the county , though , seems more interested in those people who don't even try , those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food .</s>

<s>a driver of a dairy truck , who begins work at 1 a.m. finishes before breakfast , then goes out and grows a garden , and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five , asked , what in the world will we do ?</s>

<s>what in the world , echoed others , those come with the beans , potatoes , the tomatoes , will any of us do ?</s>

<s>Moss , a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county , doesn't believe it will close .</s>

<s>but he is in the middle , an employe of DeKalb , but on the side of the people .</s>

<s>the young married people ;
the old couples .</s>

<s>the dairy truck driver ;

<s>don't ask me if I think the cannery helps , he said .</s>

<s>sir , I know the cannery helps .</s>

<s>most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard .</s>

<s>when a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say , just forget it .</s>

<s>there is one thing I know ;
a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge .</s>

<s>I know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades .</s>

<s>several years ago I was his pastor .</s>

<s>one night , at the close of the evening service , he came forward , left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to God .</s>

<s>after almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on his land .</s>

<s>we tried to settle this dispute , he said , but could never come to an agreement .</s>

<s>I settled it tonight , he continued .</s>

<s>I leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart , I have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor .</s>

<s>forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the Kingdom of God .</s>

<s>you cannot wear the banner of God and at the same time harbor envy , jealousy and grudges in your heart .</s>

<s>Henry Van Dyke said , forgive and forget if you can ;
but forgive anyway .</s>

<s>Jesus made three things clear about forgiveness .</s>

<s>we must , first of all , be willing to forgive others before we can secure God's forgiveness .</s>

<s>for if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you : but if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive -- your trespasses .</s>

<s>Matthew 6 : 14-15 .</s>

<s>it will do no good to seek God's forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong .</s>

<s>then , Jesus indicated that God's forgiveness is unlimited .</s>

<s>in the prayer Jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words , forgive us our debts .</s>

<s>when a person meets God's requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven .</s>

<s>God's mercy and patience will last forever .</s>

<s>forgiveness implies more than a person wanting his past sins covered by God's love .</s>

<s>it also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past .</s>

<s>we want the past forgiven , but at the same time we must be willing for God to direct the future .</s>

<s>finally , we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us .</s>

<s>once Peter asked , how oft shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ?</s>

<s>till seven times ?</s>

<s>Jesus saith unto him , until seventy times seven .</s>

<s>Matthew 18 : 21-22 .</s>

<s>Jesus not only taught forgiveness , He gave us an example of it on the cross .</s>

<s>with all the energy of his broken body he prayed , Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do .</s>

<s>she's been in and out of my house for a dozen years now , although she's still a teen-ager who looks like a baby , she is getting married .</s>

<s>her mother , now dead , was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring I had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her , something her mother would wish said .</s>

<s>for a while there was such shrill girlish commotion I couldn't have made myself heard if I'd had the equivalent of the message to Garcia .</s>

<s>but when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female -- six girls sprawled on one bed , drinking Cokes and giggling -- she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute .</s>

<s>how do you know you love somebody enough to get married ?</s>

<s>she asked .</s>

<s>it was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked : how can you be sure ?</s>

<s>aren't you sure ?</s>

<s>I asked , looking at her searchingly .</s>

<s>I wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait , to consider , to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important .</s>

<s>but if she were just having a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage .</s>

<s>besides , in all honesty , I don't know how you can be sure .</s>

<s>I don't know any secret recipe for certainty .</s>

<s>in the fevered , intoxicating , breathless state of being in love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscured .</s>

<s>I knew of but one test and I threw it out to her for what it was worth .</s>

<s>does he ever bore you ?</s>

<s>I asked .</s>

<s>bore me ?</s>

<s>she was shocked .</s>

<s>oh , no-o ]
why , he's so darling and I mean , I went on ruthlessly , when he's not talking about you or himself or the wonders of love , is he interesting ?</s>

<s>does he care about things that matter to you ?</s>

<s>can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating ?</s>

<s>because , honey , I thought silently , there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage -- long periods when you're hopelessly stranded , together .</s>

<s>and if you bore each other then , heaven help you .</s>

<s>she came back the other day to reassure me .</s>

<s>she has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting .</s>

<s>she asked if I had other advice and , heady with success , I rushed it in , I hope not too late .</s>

<s>I do not know Dr. Wilson Sneed well .</s>

<s>but I was deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of St. Luke's Church in Atlanta .</s>

<s>it was the cry of not just one heart ;
it spoke for many in the clergy , I suspect .</s>

<s>the pulpit is a lonely place .</s>

<s>who stops to think of that ?</s>

<s>imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church .</s>

<s>such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments , he told his members .</s>

<s>a minister should not stay beyond the time that his leadership should benefit his church , he wrote , for he becomes ordinary .</s>

<s>and so the young minister resigned , to go and study and pray , having never passed a day , he told his parishioners , when I did not gain from you far more than I ever gave to you .</s>

<s>his very honest act called up the recent talk I had with another minister , a modest Methodist , who said : I feel so deeply blessed by God when I can give a message of love and comfort to other men , and I would have it no other way : and it is unworthy to think of self .</s>

<s>but oh , how I do sometimes need just a moment of rest , and peace , in myself .</s>

<s>a man who gives himself to God and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving .</s>

<s>he does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach .</s>

<s>the good ones are not motivated to seek vainly , nor are they disposed to covet comfort , or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity .</s>

<s>theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards .</s>

<s>yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him -- we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due , we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul .</s>

<s>we press him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word , and God's .</s>

<s>we do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty , but we add to their burden , while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks a week , American cash .</s>

<s>if we break the minister to our bit , we are buying back our own sins .</s>

<s>if he won't break , we add to the stress he bears .</s>

<s>and a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man -- prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to .</s>

<s>we expect him to be noble , and to make us so -- yet he knows , and tries to tell us , how very humble man must be .</s>

<s>we expect bestowal of God's love through him .</s>

<s>but how little love we give him .</s>

<s>the church truly is not a rest home for saints , but a hospital for sinners .</s>

<s>yet every Sunday we sinners go to that emergency room to receive first aid , and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers , too .</s>

<s>Mr. Podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at Loon Lake .</s>

<s>the narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure .</s>

<s>the evening was not always spent in the same way .</s>

<s>this year , on a night cool with the front of September moving in , but with plenty of summer still about , the Podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the Pod .</s>

<s>the little cottage was bursting with people of all ages .</s>

<s>in the midst of it all , Mr. Podger came out on the Pod porch , alone .</s>

<s>he had that day attended a country auction , and he had come back with a prize .</s>

<s>the prize was an old-fashioned , woven cloth hammock , complete with cross-top pillow , fringed side pieces , and hooks for hanging .</s>

<s>Mrs. Podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it , and there it was , slung in a vine-shaded corner , the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow , caressing movement .</s>

<s>Mr. Podger sat down in it , pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow , rhythmic motions , and then swung his feet up into it .</s>

<s>he closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him .</s>

<s>suddenly one young voice rose above the others .</s>

<s>but , it said , do you always know when you're happy ?</s>

<s>the voice sank back into the general tangle of sound , but the question stayed in Mr. Podger's mind .</s>

<s>here , in the cool , autumn-touched evening , Mr. Podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace .</s>

<s>it had begun with the blue jay feather .</s>

<s>walking along the lake before breakfast , Mr. Podger had seen the feather , and the bird that had lost it in flight .</s>

<s>the winging spread of blue had gone on , calling harshly , into the wood .</s>

<s>the small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet .</s>

<s>all day long Mr. Podger , who was a straw-hat man in the summer , had worn the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield .</s>

<s>would a blue feather in a man's hat make him happy all day ?</s>

<s>hardly .</s>

<s>but it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine , linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake .</s>

<s>then , since the auction was being held nearby , he had walked to it .</s>

<s>and there , on the way , had been the box turtle , that slow , self-contained , world-ignoring relic of pre-history , bent , for reasons best known to itself , on crossing the road .</s>

<s>it was doing very well , too , having reached the center , and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when Mr. Podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car .</s>

<s>would the driver see the turtle ?</s>

<s>would he take pains to avoid it ?</s>

<s>Mr. Podger took no chances .</s>

<s>taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it , Mr. Podger stepped into the road , lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking suddenness .</s>

<s>the turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon .</s>

<s>but Mr. Podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other .</s>

<s>here in the cool darkness Mr. Podger could still feel the warmth of midday , could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road , could still see the friendly grin on the young , sun-browned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight .</s>

<s>where was the driver now ?</s>

<s>what was he doing ?</s>

<s>and the turtle ?</s>

<s>Mr. Podger smiled .</s>

<s>for a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama .</s>

<s>the three would never meet again , but for some reason or other Mr. Podger was sure he would always remember the incident .</s>

<s>then there had been the auction itself .</s>

<s>Mr. Podger heard again ;
at will , the voice of the auctioneer , the voices of the bidders , and finally the small boy who had been so interested in Mr. Podger's hammock purchase .</s>

<s>I like them things , too , he had said .</s>

<s>we got one at home .</s>

<s>you know what ?</s>

<s>if you're lyin' out in the hammock at night , and it gets kinda cool -- you know -- you just take these sides with the fringe on -- see -- and wrap 'em right over you .</s>

<s>I do it , lots o' times -- I like to lie in a hammock at night , by myself , when it's all quiet .</s>

<s>the wind moves it a little bit -- you know .</s>

<s>Mr. Podger had thanked him gravely , and now he made use of the advice .</s>

<s>as he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon , Mr. Podger saw that thin , attractive , freckled little face again , and hoped that the boy , too , was lying in a cool , fringed-wrapped quiet .</s>

<s>Alacrity , the Podger cat , came by the hammock , rubbed her back briefly against it , and then , sure of a welcome , hopped up .</s>

<s>she remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly , and Mr. Podger took her inside the fringe .</s>

<s>soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets , rivaled the hum of voices from inside the Pod .</s>

<s>Mr. Podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and Pam burst out .</s>

<s>Dad ]
she said .</s>

<s>it's getting so chilly we've lighted a fire , and we're going to tell a round robin story -- a nice , scary one .</s>

<s>we need you to start it .</s>

<s>why are you out here all by yourself ?</s>

<s>aren't you happy ?</s>

<s>Mr. Podger opened his cocoon and emerged , tucking Alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire .</s>

<s>of course I am , he said .</s>

<s>never happier in my life .</s>

<s>I just came out here to know it .</s>

<s>Dallas
as the South begins another school year , national and even world attention is directed at the region's slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools .</s>

<s>desegregation is beginning in two more important Southern cities -- Dallas and Atlanta .</s>

<s>in each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment .</s>

<s>these programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully .</s>

<s>the programs do not take sides on the issue itself .</s>

<s>they point out simply that it is the law of the land .</s>

<s>the two cities have the examples of Little Rock and New Orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation .</s>

<s>even better , they have the examples of Nashville and Houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs .</s>

<s>in each case there was an initial act of violence .</s>

<s>in Nashville , a school was dynamited .</s>

<s>in Houston , there were a few incidents of friction between whites and Negroes , none of which were serious .</s>

<s>in each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents .</s>

<s>the Nashville plan , incidentally , has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled South .</s>

<s>it is a stair-step plan , in which desegregation begins in the first grade .</s>

<s>each year another grade is added to the process , until finally all 12 grades are integrated .</s>

<s>the schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done , so why not now .</s>

<s>the program has worked well in both Nashville and Houston .</s>

<s>it met a serious rebuff in New Orleans , where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents .</s>

<s>another attempt will be made this year in New Orleans to resume the program .</s>

<s>generally , throughout the South , there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met .</s>

<s>perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in Dallas .</s>

<s>during the summer , Negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments .</s>

<s>it was part of a citywide move toward full integration .</s>

<s>so successful has been this program , worked out by white and Negro civic leaders , that further extensions are expected in the next few months .</s>

<s>hotels , for example , are ready to let down the bars .</s>

<s>already , at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis .</s>

<s>several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis .</s>

<s>this is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago , when a series of bombings was directed against Negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods of Dallas .</s>

<s>it is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the South .</s>

<s>Southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop Negroes from claiming equal rights .</s>

<s>they insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama when the Freedom Riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots .</s>

<s>all across the South there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it .</s>

<s>there are many causes for this change .</s>

<s>one of the most important is economic .</s>

<s>business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence .</s>

<s>they are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order .</s>

<s>in the past these same Southerners were inclined to look the other way .</s>

<s>and as the businessmen have begun to act , a real sense of co-operation has sprung up .</s>

<s>this co-operation has emboldened other Southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation .</s>

<s>they realize that by acting in concert , rather than individually , they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation -- economic and otherwise .</s>

<s>since moving from a Chicago suburb to Southern California a few months ago , I've been introduced to a new game called Lanesmanship .</s>

<s>played mostly on the freeways around Los Angeles , it goes like this : a driver cruising easily at 70 m.p.h.</s>

<s>in Lane J of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead .</s>

<s>traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into Lane J , which is heavily populated by cars also moving at 70 m.p.h.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>the adjacent driver in Lane J has three choices open to him .</s>

<s>he can ( 1 ) point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into Lane J ;
( 2 ) slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes ;
or ( 3 ) alternately accelerate and decelerate , thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions , thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair .</s>

<s>the really remarkable thing to me is that most California natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access .</s>

<s>whether or not this is done out of enlightened self-preservation , I don't know .</s>

<s>but it is done , consistently and I'm both surprised and impressed .</s>

<s>this could never happen in my native Chicago .</s>

<s>there such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood .</s>

<s>in Chicago , the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back .</s>

<s>failing this , he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly .</s>

<s>this negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways , however , does an injustice to Southern California drivers .</s>

<s>at the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at Marshall Field and Company , I would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype .</s>

<s>after three months of research , I can state unequivocally that Los Angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers I've ever encountered .</s>

<s>during one recent day of driving about Los Angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street .</s>

<s>Miami , Fla. , March 17 .</s>

<s>an out-of-town writer came up to Paul Richards today and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year .</s>

<s>now Richards , of course , is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go .</s>

<s>he can often make the complex ridiculously simple , and vice versa .</s>

<s>this happened to be vice versa , but even so , the answer was a masterpiece .</s>

<s>it's a whole lot easier , he said , to increase the population of Nevada , than it is to increase the population of New York city .</s>

<s>and with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher .</s>

<s>that is undoubtedly a hell of a quote , said the writer , scratching his head .</s>

<s>now , if I can just figure out what he's talking about , I'll use it .</s>

<s>two spots open
this was just Richard's way of saying that last year the Birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open .</s>

<s>some brilliant rookies nailed them down , so that this spring just two spots , left and right field , are really up for grabs .</s>

<s>it should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year , but so far it hasn't worked that way .</s>

<s>this angle of just where the Orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one .</s>

<s>you'd never guess it from the way they've played so far this spring , but there remains a feeling among some around here that the Orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961 .</s>

<s>obviously , if this club is going to move from second to first in the American League , it will have to show improvement someplace .</s>

<s>where can that improvement possibly come from ?</s>

<s>you certainly can't expect the infield to do any better than it did last year .</s>

<s>Robby could be better .</s>

<s>Brooks Robinson is great , and it is conceivable that he'll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960 .</s>

<s>you can't expect it , though .</s>

<s>Robby's performance last year was tremendous .</s>

<s>it's the same with Ron Hansen and Jim Gentile .</s>

<s>if they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no complaint .</s>

<s>they shouldn't be asked to carry any more of the burden .</s>

<s>Hansen will be getting a late spring training start , which might very well set him back .</s>

<s>he got off to an exceptional start last season , and under the circumstances probably won't duplicate it .</s>

<s>there are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year .</s>

<s>they don't expect to stop him , just slow him down some with the bat .</s>

<s>he'll still be a top player , they concede , because he's got a great glove and the long ball going for him .</s>

<s>but they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production .</s>

<s>Breeding might move up
.</s>

<s>Gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs .</s>

<s>don't ask him more .</s>

<s>I have a hunch Marv Breeding might move up a notch .</s>

<s>but even so , he had a good year in 1960 and won't do too much better .</s>

<s>so , all in all , the infield can't be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the Birds from second to first .</s>

<s>and the pitching will also have trouble doing better .</s>

<s>Richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season .</s>

<s>where , then , can we look for improvement ?</s>

<s>from Triandos , Brandt and Walker , answers Richards .</s>

<s>they're the ones we can expect to do better .</s>

<s>the man is right , and at this time , indications are that these three are ready for better seasons .</s>

<s>Triandos hasn't proved it yet , but he says he's convinced his thumb is all right .</s>

<s>he jammed it this spring and has had to rest it , but he says the old injury hasn't bothered him .</s>

<s>if he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years , the club will have to be better off offensively .</s>

<s>I'm still not convinced , though , I'll have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him .</s>

<s>Hank Foiles , backed up by Frank House who will be within calling distance in the minors , make up better second line catching than the Birds had all last year , but Gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant .</s>

<s>to me , Brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year .</s>

<s>he hasn't played too much , because Richards has been working on him furiously in batting practice .</s>

<s>he's hitting the ball hard , in the batting cage , and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year .</s>

<s>when he came to Baltimore , he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the National League pennant , and he was joining what seemed to be a second division American League club .</s>

<s>he was down , hard to talk to , and far too nonchalant on the field .</s>

<s>as of now , that all seems behind him .</s>

<s>he's been entirely different all spring .</s>

<s>and Walker looks stronger , seems to be throwing better than he did last year .</s>

<s>let him bounce back , and he could really set up the staff .</s>

<s>so , if the Orioles are to improve , Brandt , Triandos and Walker will have to do it .</s>

<s>so far the platoons on left and right fielders don't seem capable of carrying the load .</s>

<s>of course , this isn't taking into consideration the population of Nevada and New York city , but it's the way things look from here at this point .</s>

<s>is the mother of an autistic child at fault ?</s>

<s>( the autistic child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self .</s>

<s>he tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects -- and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people .
)</s>

<s>did his mother make him this way ?</s>

<s>some people believe she did .</s>

<s>we think differently .</s>

<s>we believe that autism , like so many other conditions of defect and deviation , is to a large extent inborn .</s>

<s>a mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties .</s>

<s>sometimes she can -- to a large extent -- help him overcome them .</s>

<s>but we don't think she creates them .</s>

<s>we don't think she can make her child defective , emotionally disturbed or autistic .</s>

<s>the mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often , by sharing her experiences , she can help other mothers with the same problem .</s>

<s>since little is known about autism , and almost nothing has been written for the layman , we'd like to share one experienced mother's comments .</s>

<s>she wrote : total disinterest
.</s>

<s>as the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything , I have to manipulate my son's fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy .</s>

<s>he wants me to do everything for him .</s>

<s>you don't believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them .</s>

<s>but I do and my psychiatrist does , too .</s>

<s>I know that my son wants control and direction , but being autistic myself I cannot give full control or direction .</s>

<s>one thing I notice which I have seldom heard mentioned .</s>

<s>this is that autistic people don't enjoy physical contact with others -- for instance , my children and I .</s>

<s>when I hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board .</s>

<s>he pushes and straightens himself as if he can't stand the feeling of being held .</s>

<s>physical contact is uncomfortable for him ]
this mother is quite correct .</s>

<s>as a rule , the autistic child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others .</s>

<s>parents have to find other ways of comforting him .</s>

<s>for the young child this may be no more than providing food , light or movement .</s>

<s>as he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object ( his magic thing ) .</s>

<s>or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick .</s>

<s>the answer is different for each autistic child , but for most there is an answer .</s>

<s>only ingenuity will uncover it .</s>

<s>what future holds
dear Doctors : we learned this year that our older son , Daniel , is autistic .</s>

<s>we did not accept the diagnosis at once , but gradually we are coming to .</s>

<s>fortunately , there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend , with a group of normal children .</s>

<s>I try to treat Daniel as if he were normal , though of course I realize he is far from that at present .</s>

<s>what I do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible .</s>

<s>I try to give him as many normal experiences as possible .</s>

<s>what is your experience with autistic children ?</s>

<s>how do they turn out later ?</s>

<s>many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives .</s>

<s>certainly , most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people , but many adjust to school , even college , to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood .</s>

<s>single-color use question
-- a first grader colors pictures one solid color , everything -- sky , grass , boy , wagon , etc.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>when different colors are used , she is just as likely to color trees purple , hair green , etc.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>the other children in the class use this same coloring book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color .</s>

<s>should I show my daughter how things should be colored ?</s>

<s>she is an aggressive , nervous child .</s>

<s>is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits ?</s>

<s>answer
-- her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring , without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects .</s>

<s>this immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature for the first grade .</s>

<s>no , coloring isn't exactly something you teach a child .</s>

<s>you sometimes give them a little demonstration , a little guidance , and suggestions about staying inside the lines .</s>

<s>but most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration .</s>

<s>seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest in an old art : embroidery .</s>

<s>possibly responsible for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms , which seems slated to replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed .</s>

<s>just as a varitinted Oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme , so may some of the newest versions of embroidery .</s>

<s>one such , in fact , is a rug .</s>

<s>though not actually crewel embroidery , it has that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue , pink , bronze and gold and a sauterne background .</s>

<s>the twirled , stylized design of winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery during the Jacobean period in England .</s>

<s>traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available in this country .</s>

<s>the work is executed in England ( by hand ) and can be worked in any desired design and color .</s>

<s>among some recent imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color .</s>

<s>Chinese influence
for a particularly fabulous room which houses a collection of fine English Chippendale furniture , fabric wall panels were embroidered with a typically Chinese-inspired design of this revered Eighteenth Century period .</s>

<s>since the work is done by hand , the only limitation , it is said , is that of human conception .</s>

<s>modern embroidered panels , framed and meant to be hung on the wall , are another aspect of this trend .</s>

<s>these have never gone out of style in Scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and there in shops which specialize in handicrafts .</s>

<s>an amateur decorator might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings , and , by picking up her living room color scheme , add a decorative do-it-yourself note to the room .</s>

<s>California Democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling in a thousand district headquarters , party clubrooms and workers' backyards .</s>

<s>they seem darned proud of it .</s>

<s>and they're confident that the J , currently assailed by dissensions within the ranks , will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood of this grassroots-fueled machine .</s>

<s>their meeting at San Francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the California Democratic Council directorate .</s>

<s>but it will include 200-odd officeholders , organization leaders and interested party people .</s>

<s>out of this session may come : 1 -- plans for a dramatic , broad-scale party rally in Los Angeles next December that would enlist top-drawer Democrats from all over the country .</s>

<s>2 -- blueprints for doubling the J present 55,000 enrollment .</s>

<s>3 -- arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in Fresno next Jan. 26-28 .</s>

<s>4 -- and proposals for a whole series of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state's 38 new Congressional districts .</s>

<s>at the head of the J is an unorthodox , 39-year-old amateur politico , Thomas B. Carvey Jr. , whose normal profession is helping develop Hughes Aircraft's moon missiles .</s>

<s>he's approached his Democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering fashion .</s>

<s>viewed from afar , the J looks like a rather stalwart political pyramid : its elected directorate fans out into an array of district leaders and standing committees , and thence into its component clubs and affiliated groups -- 500 or so .</s>

<s>much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every volunteer Democratic organization of any consequence belongs to the J .</s>

<s>moreover , the entire state Democratic hierarchy , from Gov.</s>

<s>Brown on down to the county chairmen , also participates in this huge operation .</s>

<s>contrarily , Republican volunteers go their separate ways , and thus far have given no indication that they'd be willing to join forces under a single directorate , except in the most loose-knit fashion .</s>

<s>Carvey believes that reapportionment , which left many Democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries , actually will increase J membership .</s>

<s>where only one club existed before , he says , two will flourish henceforth .</s>

<s>biggest organizational problem , he adds , is setting up J units in rock-ribbed Democratic territory .</s>

<s>paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party's favor , strongest where Democrats and Republicans compete on a fairly even basis .</s>

<s>like most Democratic spokesmen , Carvey predicts 1962 will be a tremendously partisan year .</s>

<s>hence the attention they're lavishing on the J .</s>

<s>in all probability , the council will screen and endorse candidates for the Assembly and for Congress , and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary favorites .</s>

<s>this bodes heated contests in several districts where claims have already been staked out by Democratic hopefuls who don't see eye-to-eye with the J .</s>

<s>naturally , the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council .</s>

<s>shunted aside by the rampant organizers for John F. Kennedy last year , who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the Presidential campaign , the J plainly intends to provide the party's campaign muscle in 1962 .</s>

<s>there is evidence that it will be happily received by Gov.</s>

<s>Brown and the other constitutional incumbents .</s>

<s>Carvey considers that former Vice President Nixon would be Brown's most formidable foe , with ex-Gov.</s>

<s>Knight a close second .</s>

<s>but the rest of the J gubernatorial aspirants don't worry him very much .</s>

<s>in his J work , Carvey has the close-in support and advice of one of California's shrewdest political strategists : former Democratic National Committeeman Paul Ziffren , who backed him over a Northland candidate espoused by Atty.</s>

<s>Gen. Stanley Mosk .</s>

<s>( significantly , bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle that saw Mosk moving into the national committee post over Ziffren are still audible in party circles .
)</s>

<s>note : we've just received an announcement of the 54th Assembly district post-reapportionment organizing convention Wednesday night in South Pasadena's War Memorial Bldg.</s>

<s>this is going to be a language lesson , and you can master it in a few minutes .</s>

<s>it is a short course in Communese .</s>

<s>it works with English , Russian , German , Hungarian or almost any other foreign tongue .</s>

<s>once you learn how to translate Communese , much of each day's deluge of news will become clearer .</s>

<s>at least , I have found it so .</s>

<s>for some compulsive reason which would have fascinated Dr. Freud , Communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves .</s>

<s>they accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves are most guilty .</s>

<s>President Kennedy's latest warning to the Communist world that the United States will build up its military strength to meet any challenge in Berlin or elsewhere was , somewhat surprisingly , reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the Iron Curtain .</s>

<s>then the Communese reply came back from many mouthpieces with striking consistency .</s>

<s>now listen closely : Moscow radio from the Literary Gazette in English to England : President Kennedy once again interpreted the Soviet proposals , to sign a peace treaty with Germany as a threat , as part of the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism .</s>

<s>evidently the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred up in the West have been planned long in advance .</s>

<s>the West Berlin crisis is being played up artificially because it is needed by the United States to justify its arms drive .</s>

<s>the Soviet news agency J datelined from New York in English to Europe : President Kennedy's enlargement of the American military program was welcomed on Wall Street as a stimulus to the American munitions industry .</s>

<s>when the stock exchange opened this morning , many dealers were quick to purchase shares in Douglas , Lockheed and United Aircraft and prices rose substantially .</s>

<s>over 4 million shares were sold , the highest figures since early June .</s>

<s>( quotations follow .
)</s>

<s>J datelined Los Angeles , in English to Europe : former Vice President Nixon came out in support of President Kennedy's program for stepping up the arms race .</s>

<s>he also demanded that Kennedy take additional measures to increase international tension : specifically to crush the Cuban revolution , resume nuclear testing , resist more vigorously admission of China to its lawful seat in the United Nations , and postpone non-military programs at home .</s>

<s>TASS from Moscow in English to Europe : the American press clamored for many days promising President Kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems confronting the United States .</s>

<s>in fact , the world heard nothing but sabre-rattling , the same exercises which proved futile for the predecessors of the current President .</s>

<s>if there were no West Berlin problem , imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems besetting the United States and its J partners .</s>

<s>Washington apparently decided to use an old formula , by injecting large military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the U.S. economy after a prolonged slump .</s>

<s>and now , for Communist listeners and readers : Moscow Radio in Russian to the J : the U.S. President has shown once again that the United States needs the fanning of the West Berlin crisis to justify the armaments race .</s>

<s>as was to be expected Kennedy's latest speech was greeted with enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in Bonn , where officials of the West German government praised it .</s>

<s>Moscow Novosti article in Russian , datelined London : U.S. pressure on Britain to foster war hysteria over the status of West Berlin has reached its apogee .</s>

<s>British common sense is proverbial .</s>

<s>the present attempts of the politicians to contaminate ordinary Britons shows that this British common sense is unwilling to pull somebody else's chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures .</s>

<s>East Berlin ( Communist ) radio in German to Germany : a better position for negotiations is the real point of this speech .</s>

<s>Kennedy knows the West will not wage war for West Berlin , neither conventional nor nuclear , and negotiations will come as certainly as the peace treaty .</s>

<s>whenever some Washington circles were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the Pentagon and in Bonn .</s>

<s>in Kennedy's speech are cross currents , sensible ones and senseless ones , reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the President's advisers and the political and economic forces behind them .</s>

<s>well , dear listeners , despite all the shouting , there will be no war over West Berlin .</s>

<s>Moscow J in Russian datelined Sochi : Chairman Khrushchev received the U.S. President's disarmament adviser , John McCloy .</s>

<s>their conversation and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere .</s>

<s>now , to translate from the Communese , this means : the West Berlin crisis is really an East Berlin crisis .</s>

<s>the crisis was artificially stirred up by the Kremlin ( Wall Street ) and the Red Army ( Pentagon ) egged on by the West Germans ( East Germans ) .</s>

<s>the reason was to speed up domestic production in the J , which Khrushchev promised upon grabbing power , and try to end the permanent recession in Russian living standards .</s>

<s>Chairman Khrushchev ( Kennedy ) rattles his rockets ( sabre ) in order to cure his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position .</s>

<s>his advisers in the Politburo ( White House ) are engaged in a great struggle of opinions , so he is not always consistent .</s>

<s>the Soviet Union will fight neither a conventional nor a nuclear war over Berlin , and neither will its Warsaw Pact allies .</s>

<s>the West has no intention of attacking Russia .</s>

<s>Chairman Khrushchev and John McCloy had a terrible row at Sochi .</s>

<s>see , Communese is easy -- once you get onto it .</s>

<s>Aug. 4 , 1821 , nearly a century after Benjamin Franklin founded the Pennsylvania Gazette -- a century during which it had undergone several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication -- this paper made its first appearance as the Saturday Evening Post .</s>

<s>the country was now full of Gazettes and Samuel C. Atkinson and Charles Alexander , who had just taken over Franklin's old paper , desired a more distinctive name .</s>

<s>the 350th anniversary of the King James Bible is being celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the New Testament , the first part of the New English Bible , undertaken as a new translation of the Scriptures into contemporary English .</s>

<s>since it was issued in the spring of 1611 , the King James Version has been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the Bible .</s>

<s>however , Biblical scholars frequently attested to its numerous inaccuracies , as old manuscripts were uncovered and scholarship advanced .</s>

<s>this resulted in revisions of the King James Bible in 1881-85 as the English Revised Version and in 1901 as the American Standard Version .</s>

<s>then in 1937 America's International Council of Religious Education authorized a new revision , in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages .</s>

<s>undertaken by 32 American scholars , under the chairmanship of Rev.</s>

<s>Dr. Luther A. Weigle , former dean of Yale University Divinity School , their studies resulted in the publishing of the Revised Standard Version , 1946-52 .</s>

<s>not rival
the New English Bible ( the Old Testament and Apocrypha will be published at a future date ) has not been planned to rival or replace the King James Version , but , as its cover states , it is offered simply as the Bible to all those who will use it in reading , teaching , or worship .</s>

<s>time , of course will testify whether the new version will have achieved its purpose .</s>

<s>Bible reading , even more so than good classical music , grows in depth and meaning upon repetition .</s>

<s>if this new Bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years , it will not survive the ages as has the King James Version .</s>

<s>however , an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the British Biblical scholars .</s>

<s>one is impressed with the dignity , clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary English , and there is no doubt that the meaning of the Bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the King James .</s>

<s>for example , in the third chapter of Matthew , verses 13-16 , describing the baptism of Jesus , the 1611 version reads : then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John , to be baptized of him .</s>

<s>but John forbad him , saying , I have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ?</s>

<s>and Jesus answering said unto him , suffer it to be so now : for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness .</s>

<s>then he suffered him .</s>

<s>and Jesus , when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water : and lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and lighting upon him .</s>

<s>clearer meaning
certainly , the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar with Biblical teachings , in the New English Bible which reads : then Jesus arrived at Jordan from Galilee , and he came to John to be baptized by him .</s>

<s>John tried to dissuade him .</s>

<s>do you come to me ?</s>

<s>he said ;
I need rather to be baptized by you .</s>

<s>Jesus replied , let it be so for the present ;
we do well to conform this way with all that God requires .</s>

<s>John then allowed him to come .</s>

<s>after baptism Jesus came up out of the water at once , and at that moment heaven opened ;
he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove to alight upon him ;
( the paragraphing , spelling and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version .
)</s>

<s>among the most frequently quoted Biblical sentences are the Beatitudes and yet so few persons , other than scholars , really understand the true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by Jesus at the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount .</s>

<s>to illustrate , the first blessing in the King James Bible reads : blessed are the poor in spirit ;
for their's is the kingdom of heaven .</s>

<s>the new version states : how blest are those who know that they are poor ;
the kingdom of Heaven is theirs .</s>

<s>some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one , but almost anyone , with a fair knowledge of the English language , can understand the meaning , without the necessity of interpretation by a Biblical scholar .</s>

<s>to a novice that is significant .</s>

<s>in the second and third chapters of Revelation the new version retains , however , the old phrase angel of the church which Biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop .</s>

<s>this is not contemporary English .</s>

<s>mostly contemporary
for the most part , however , the new version is contemporary and , as such , should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of Christ .</s>

<s>originally recorded by hand , these words have been copied and recopied , translated and retranslated through the ages .</s>

<s>discoveries recently made of old Biblical manuscripts in Hebrew and Greek and other ancient writings , some by the early church fathers , in themselves called for a restudy of the Bible .</s>

<s>to have the results recorded in everyday usable English should be of benefit to all who seek the truth .</s>

<s>there is one danger , however .</s>

<s>with contemporary English changing with the rapidity that marks this jet age , some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic .</s>

<s>she can decrease the number of temptations .</s>

<s>she can remove all knick-knacks within reach .</s>

<s>the fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be .</s>

<s>she should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child .</s>

<s>if he can't play with Mommy's magazines , he should have some old numbers of his own .</s>

<s>if Daddy's books are out of bounds his own picture books are not .</s>

<s>toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove .</s>

<s>it is not much better if he meets with old classmates .</s>

<s>too often , unless he hails them , they pass him by .</s>

<s>The Providence Journal editorial ( Jan. 25 ) entitled East Greenwich Faces A Housing Development Problem points to a dilemma that faces communities such as ours .</s>

<s>your suggested solution , it seems to me , is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally realistic attitude toward , and endorsement of , sound planning .</s>

<s>first of all there is ample area in East Greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested .</s>

<s>this land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town .</s>

<s>the demand for these lots can be met for some time to come .</s>

<s>this would seem to indicate that we are trying neither to halt an influx of migrants nor are we setting up such standards for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy land and build in the new sites .</s>

<s>what we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development .</s>

<s>it is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs .</s>

<s>Bostitch , Inc. is approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate tax .</s>

<s>the wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter , but this particular instance is , in my opinion , completely satisfactory .</s>

<s>the 1960 tax book for East Greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollars .</s>

<s>with our current $3 per hundred tax rate , it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should try to develop a modest industrial plant as the best way to meet these problems .</s>

<s>in order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure .</s>

<s>as this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow .</s>

<s>Mr. Richard Preston , executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission , in his remarks to the Governors Conference on Industrial Development at Providence on October 8 , 1960 , warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when he said : if this is the fundamental reason for a community's interest or if this is the basic approach , success if any will be difficult to obtain .</s>

<s>he went on to say : in the first place , industry per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities .</s>

<s>it is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be .</s>

<s>while Councilman Olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer , the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth .</s>

<s>we in East Greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities , one currently utilizing double sessions in their schools , and the other facing this prospect next year .</s>

<s>it has already been reported in your newspapers that the East Greenwich School Committee is considering additions to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase .</s>

<s>if they are to be commended for foresight in their planning , what then is the judgment of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage ?</s>

<s>where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have called for in other editorials ?</s>

<s>I submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not facing the facts of life .</s>

<s>the fruitful course of metropolitanization that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of East Greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it was called .</s>

<s>for example : 1 .</s>

<s>the East Greenwich Police Department utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the Warwick Police Department , thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and ensuring police coordination in the Cowessett-East Greenwich-Potowomut area of the two communities .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>the East Greenwich Fire District services parts of Warwick as well as East Greenwich .</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>the taxpayers of East Greenwich appropriate sums of money , as do other Kent County communities , for the support of the Kent County Memorial Hospital , a regional facility .</s>

<s>4 .</s>

<s>the East Greenwich Free Library receives financial support from the town of East Greenwich and the City of Warwick to supplement its endowment .</s>

<s>5 .</s>

<s>feelers were put out last year to the City of Warwick , as reported in your newspapers , suggesting investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the Potowomut and Cowessett areas of Warwick along with East Greenwich .</s>

<s>6 .</s>

<s>East Greenwich was one of the first Rhode Island towns to enter into contract agreement with the Rhode Island Development Council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves .</s>

<s>7 .</s>

<s>the education program for retarded children conducted by the East Greenwich school system has pupils from at least one neighboring community .</s>

<s>I feel compelled to write this because I am greatly concerned with the problem of community growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such as East Greenwich .</s>

<s>I believe it is an area in which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts ;
and yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devised .</s>

<s>these programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when , where , and in what manner the community shall grow .</s>

<s>we have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions .</s>

<s>until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts , I hope we in East Greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny .</s>

<s>I would like very much , on behalf of my husband and myself , to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the Gabrielle Fund .</s>

<s>the Providence Sunday Journal article ( Jan. 29 ) asking whether American taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities sounds as though The Providence Journal is desperate for news .</s>

<s>usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page .</s>

<s>on the question of admission to Veterans Administration hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled veterans , it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service .</s>

<s>it can manifest itself before discharge from service , or it can come out years later .</s>

<s>there is one other point we should never lose sight of : many veterans who enter J hospitals as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected .</s>

<s>no psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years .</s>

<s>the arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected case , seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with the wishes of the general public .</s>

<s>I believe in priority for service-connected disabled veterans in admission to J hospitals .</s>

<s>but I don't believe we should close the door on non-service-connected patients .</s>

<s>this matter is of great importance , and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death , or at least serious injuries , for many veterans .</s>

<s>some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long .</s>

<s>there's a reason for this length of stay .</s>

<s>first of all , the admitting physician in the J hospital gets the patient as a new patient .</s>

<s>he has no experience with this veteran's previous medical record .</s>

<s>if the doctor is conscientious , he wants to study the patient .</s>

<s>as a result , it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient .</s>

<s>secondly , the J physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital , he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient .</s>

<s>so he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery .</s>

<s>the American public must be presented with the facts concerning J hospitalization .</s>

<s>the public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a J hospital , the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other .</s>

<s>the responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a J hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital .</s>

<s>an adequate system of J hospitals is better equipped to care for the veterans than any 50 state hospitals .</s>

<s>it seems that open season upon veterans' hospitalization is once more upon us .</s>

<s>the American Medical Association is once again grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the Veterans Administration medical program to the American taxpayer .</s>

<s>do they , the A.M.A.</s>

<s>, offer any solution other than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world ?</s>

<s>we veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at J hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness .</s>

<s>nevertheless , we wonder at the stand of the A.M.A.</s>

<s>on the health problem confronting the aged .</s>

<s>they opposed the Forand bill , which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction ;
yet they supported the Eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars ( matched incidentally by a federal grant ) to initiate .</s>

<s>there is a trend to packaging meat at a central source , freezing it , and shipping it to outlying stores , where meat cutters will not be required .</s>

<s>Deep Peep Show
the viewers of the Deep Peep Show at 15th and J Streets NW have an added attraction -- the view of a fossilized cypress swamp .</s>

<s>twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site , a black coal-like deposit has been encountered .</s>

<s>this is a black swamp clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress-like trees were growing .</s>

<s>the fossilized remains of many of these trees are found embedded in the clay .</s>

<s>some of the stumps are as much as three feet long , but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying sediments .</s>

<s>although the wood has been changed to coal , much of it still retains its original cell structure .</s>

<s>in the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants growing in the region at the time .</s>

<s>these microfossils indicate the swamp was formed during the Lower Cretaceous period when dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing .</s>

<s>the 15th Street deposit is not to be confused with the nearby famous Mayflower Hotel cypress swamp on 17th Street reported in The Washington Post , August 2 , 1955 , which was probably formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger .</s>

<s>working for peace
recently the secretary of the Friends Committee on National Legislation was interviewed on the air .</s>

<s>while I respect his sincere concern for peace , he made four points that I would like to question .</s>

<s>1 .</s>

<s>he said , let's work for peace instead of protection from aggression .</s>

<s>I would ask , why not do both ?</s>

<s>military power does not cause war ;
war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people .</s>

<s>are we not late , especially those of us who call ourselves Friends , in doing enough about this lack of understanding ?</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>as to protection , the speaker disapproved of shelters , pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone .</s>

<s>is this a reason for saving no one ?</s>

<s>would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick up everyone ?</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>the speaker suggested that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face .</s>

<s>if the world comes to this , wouldn't it be the very time when courage and American know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild ?</s>

<s>many of our young people think it would .</s>

<s>4 .</s>

<s>lastly , the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it Civilian Defense .</s>

<s>in 1950 , Public Law 920 created Civil Defense ( different from Civilian-groups of World War 2 ) , a responsibility of the Government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster , natural or manmade .</s>

<s>far from creating fear , as the speaker suggests , preparedness -- knowing what to do in an emergency -- gives people confidence .</s>

<s>Civil Defense has far to go and many problems to solve , but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing , but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster -- storm , flood , accident or even war ?</s>

<s>pets in apartments
it seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs .</s>

<s>I feel that few burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone's apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide .</s>

<s>in addition , would not the young female public of Washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash ?</s>

<s>I grant that the dog may not be really protective , based on his training , but if you were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady to molest , how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with a dog ?</s>

<s>I would like to suggest that the landlords and Commissioners get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments .</s>

<s>sidewalk cafes
use the terraces of the Capitol for a sidewalk cafe ?</s>

<s>could Senator Humphrey be serious in his proposal ?</s>

<s>is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists' comfort ?</s>

<s>perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended .</s>

<s>the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials are rather bleak .</s>

<s>why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat ?</s>

<s>unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season .</s>

<s>as an added suggestion to balance the budget , the Government could sell advertising space on the Washington Monument .</s>

<s>it is visible throughout the city , and men from Madison Ave. would jump at the chance .</s>

<s>Sen. Hubert Humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart .</s>

<s>he , like most of us , wants to be able to sit , to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors .</s>

<s>let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens .</s>

<s>let us , like the French , have outdoor cafes where we may relax , converse at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd .</s>

<s>dissenting views of senators
two strong dissents from the majority report of the Joint Economic Committee ( May 2 ) by Senators Proxmire and Butler allege that the New Deal fiscal policy of the Thirties did not work .</s>

<s>for a neutral Germany Soviets said to fear resurgence of German militarism to the editor of the
New York Times :
for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large , powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity .</s>

<s>the United States and Soviet Russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations .</s>

<s>recent statements by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations .</s>

<s>President Kennedy was right when he said , we shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate .</s>

<s>I have just returned from a seven-week trip to Europe and the Far East .</s>

<s>it is quite evident that the people of Western Europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war .</s>

<s>the fact is that the Italians , French and British know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs .</s>

<s>we have no right to criticize them , as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war .</s>

<s>we should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into Berlin .</s>

<s>it would be criminal folly if the Communists tried to prevent us .</s>

<s>but there is nothing we can do to stop Soviet Russia from granting de facto recognition to East Germany .</s>

<s>Soviet Russia has been invaded twice by German troops in a generation .</s>

<s>in the last war Russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated .</s>

<s>probable agreement
the truth is that Communist Russia fears the resurgence of German militarism .</s>

<s>Berlin is merely being used by Moscow as a stalking horse .</s>

<s>actually , the Communists , out of fear of a united and armed Germany , would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed Germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the U.N. .</s>

<s>if the Communists are sincere in wanting a united , neutral and disarmed Germany , it might well be advantageous for the German people in this nuclear age .</s>

<s>it could provide security without cost of armaments and increase German prosperity and lessen taxation .</s>

<s>France and other Western European nations likewise fear a rearmed Germany .</s>

<s>if the German people favor such a settlement we should not oppose Germany following the example of Austria .</s>

<s>President Kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called Operation Survival which has many facets .</s>

<s>why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed Germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the Big Four powers and the United States ?</s>

<s>a united Germany , freed of militarism , might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world .</s>

<s>meeting U.N. obligations to the editor of the

<s>it is up to the Assembly to take action against them .</s>

<s>section 2 :

<s>article 19 :

<s>according to the official interpretation of the Charter , a member cannot be penalized by not having the right to vote in the General Assembly for nonpayment of financial obligations to the special United Nations' budgets , and of course cannot be expelled from the Organization ( which you suggested in your editorial ) , due to the fact that

<s>to aid international law Connally amendment's repeal held step toward world order to the editor of the
New York Times :
in your Sept. 27 editorial appraisal of the work of the First Session of the Eighty-seventh Congress you referred to the lack of consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril .</s>

<s>yet your list of things left undone did not include repeal of the Connally amendment to this country's domestic jurisdiction reservation to its adherence to the Statute of the International Court of Justice .</s>

<s>the Connally amendment says that the United States , rather than the court , shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States in a case before the World Court to which the United States is a party .</s>

<s>if the case is thus determined by us to be domestic , the court has no jurisdiction .</s>

<s>since the Connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the United States , it also prevents us from using the court effectively .</s>

<s>yet although the Kennedy Administration , and the Eisenhower Administration before it , have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the Connally amendment , as contrary to our best interests , no action has yet been taken .</s>

<s>our destiny in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace , with justice , under law .</s>

expressway answer : East River Drive to the editor of the Inquirer :
your continuing editorials concerning the Schuylkill Expressway are valuable ;
however , several pertinent considerations deserve recognition .</s>

<s>one of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea .</s>

<s>we shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice .</s>

<s>they start on the East side of the Schuylkill , have to cross over to the West to use the expressway and cross over again to the East at their destination .</s>

<s>bridges , tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings .</s>

<s>each one of these is , by its nature , a focal point or a point of natural congestion .</s>

<s>we should avoid these congestion points or , putting it another way , keep cars starting and ending on the East side of the river -- on the East side .</s>

<s>this can be accomplished by several logical steps : ( 1 ) widen the East River Drive at least one lane .</s>

<s>( 2 ) so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems .</s>

<s>( 3 ) paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges .</s>

<s>one additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the East River Drive by fifty percent .</s>

<s>( 4 ) this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the Schuylkill Expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the East River Drive .</s>

<s>the Fairmount Park Commission will no doubt approve my two proposals , because it is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the Square .</s>

<s>the matter may seem a small thing to some people , I know , but it's a very good start on the road to Totalitarianism the Commission has posted signs in Washington Square saying : the feeding of birds is prohibited in this square .</s>

<s>if birds don't belong in a square or park , what does ?</s>

<s>they are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature .</s>

<s>the trees are their homes ;

<s>starlings and blackbirds are scared off by canon , from City Hall .</s>

<s>just a preliminary measure .</s>

<s>if any are left , presently , we may expect to see signs specifically prohibiting the feeding of them too .</s>

<s>the City Government is not united in an all-out , to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs , delinquents , thugs , murderers , rapists , subversives .</s>

<s>indeed no .</s>

<s>let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on John and Jane Doe , lest one piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive .</s>

<s>unfortunately , those who would remedy our softness seek to do so with calisthenics .</s>

<s>they are working on the wrong part of our anatomy .</s>

<s>it is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft .</s>

disputes Stans column business scandal views to the editor :
the new column by Maurice Stans regarding business scandals , is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit .</s>

<s>however , he states unequivocally the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in labor .</s>

<s>I must , in fairness , take issue with his premise , primarily because the so-called scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals .</s>

<s>the area most prominently commented on during the McClellan hearings had to do with sweetheart contracts .</s>

<s>these arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes .</s>

<s>a sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute .</s>

<s>anyone familiar with the details of the McClellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders .</s>

<s>further , it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by Congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the Landrum-Griffin Act .</s>

<s>escalation unto death
the nuclear war is already being fought , except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets -- not yet .</s>

<s>it is being fought , moreover , in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories .</s>

<s>they predicted escalation , and escalation is what we are getting .</s>

<s>the biggest nuclear device the United States has exploded measured some 15 megatons , although our J are said to be carrying two 20-megaton bombs apiece .</s>

<s>some time ago , however , Mr. Khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made , the Soviet Union would make them .</s>

<s>he seems to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on hand , since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock .</s>

<s>and now , of course , the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side .</s>

<s>Khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb ?</s>

<s>so be it -- then we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety , and neutron bombs , which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing .</s>

<s>so escalation proceeds , ad infinitum or , more accurately , until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds .</s>

<s>what is needed , Philip Morrison writes in The Cornell Daily Sun ( October 26 ) is a discontinuity .</s>

<s>the escalation must end sometime , and probably quite soon .</s>

<s>only a discontinuity can end it , Professor Morrison writes .</s>

<s>the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction , or that of diplomatic policy .</s>

<s>Morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet Union or Red China , it is the most vulnerable of the great powers -- Europe of course must be written off out of hand .</s>

<s>he feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United States is the least risky path our government can take .</s>

<s>his proposal is opposed to that of Richard Nixon , Governor Rockefeller , past chairmen Strauss and McCone of the Atomic Energy Commission , Dr. Edward Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war .</s>

<s>these gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing -- in the atmosphere -- on the greatest possible scale , all in the name of national security .</s>

<s>escalation is their first love and their last ;
they will be faithful unto death .</s>

<s>capable as their minds may be in some directions , these guardians of the nation's security are incapable of learning , or even of observing .</s>

<s>if this capacity had not failed them , they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation .</s>

<s>he has gained only one thing -- he has exploded a 50-megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges .</s>

<s>but if his purpose was to inspire terror , his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously .</s>

<s>not terror , but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the Soviet sphere .</s>

<s>Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps .</s>

<s>when one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another , it is only natural .</s>

<s>thus , when the Russians sent up their first sputnik , American chagrin was human enough , and American determination to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable .</s>

<s>but to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly .</s>

<s>the tide turns

<s>they are less vocal now , when it is the West Berliners who are migrating .</s>

<s>the flood is not as great -- only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative account -- but it is symptomatic .</s>

<s>west Berlin morale is low and , in age distribution , the situation is unfavorable .</s>

<s>nearly 18 per cent of West Berlin's 2,200,000 residents are sixty-five or older , only 12.8 per cent are under fifteen .</s>

<s>the official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers or independent professional people .</s>

<s>whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead .</s>

<s>the weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from West Germany , but the hard truth , says Crossman , is that The closing off of East Berlin without interference from the West and with the use only of East German , as distinct from Russian , troops was a major Communist victory , which dealt West Berlin a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow .</s>

<s>the gallant half-city is dying on its feet .</s>

<s>another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from Bonn in The Observer ( London ) .</s>

<s>Mark Arnold-Foster writes : people are leaving ( West Berlin ) because they think it is dying .</s>

<s>they are leaving so fast that the president of the West German Employers' Federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the West to volunteer for six months' front-line work in factories in West Berlin .</s>

<s>Berlin's resilience is amazing , but if it has to hire its labor in the West the struggle will be hard indeed .</s>

<s>the handwriting is on the wall .</s>

<s>the only hope for West Berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city .</s>

<s>State Department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary , and driving two blocks into East Berlin under military escort , will not avail .</s>

<s>tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful .</s>

<s>the materials for compromise are at hand : the Nation , Walter Lippmann and other sober commentators ( see Alan Clark on p. 367 ) have spelled them out again and again .</s>

<s>a compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph , but it will save Berlin .</s>

<s>or the city can be a graveyard monument to Western intransigence , if that is what the West wants .</s>

the removal of Stalin's body from the mausoleum he shared with Lenin to less distinguished quarters in the Kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history .</s>

<s>it is , in fact , a relatively mild chastisement of the dead .</s>

<s>a British writer , Richard Haestier , in a book , Dead Men Tell Tales , recalls that in the turmoil preceding the French Revolution the body of Henry 4 , who had died nearly 180 years earlier , was torn to pieces by a mob .</s>

<s>and in England , after the Restoration , the body of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at Tyburn .</s>

<s>the head was then fixed on a pole at Westminster , and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows .</s>

<s>contemplating these posthumous punishments , Stalin should not lose all hope .</s>

<s>in 1899 , Parliament erected a statue to Cromwell in Westminster , facing Whitehall and there , presumably , he still stands .</s>

<s>Nikita Khrushchev , however , has created yet another problem for himself .</s>

<s>the Lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy , Moscow is a crowded city , and the creed of Communism deplores waste .</s>

<s>who will take Stalin's place beside Lenin ?</s>

<s>there is Karl Marx , of course , buried in London .</s>

<s>the Macmillan government might be willing to let him go , but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even the Soviet morticians could not make him look presentable .</s>

<s>who , then , is of sufficient stature to lodge with Lenin ?</s>

<s>who but Nikita himself ?</s>

<s>since he has just shown who is top dog , he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the Soviet people .</s>

<s>besides , he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which , what with exhumations and rehabilitations , seems to match that of life .</s>

<s>suppose he did lie beside Lenin , would it be permanent ?</s>

<s>if some future Khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor , would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession ?</s>

<s>when a man is laid to rest , he is entitled to stay put .</s>

<s>if Nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery , everyone will understand .</s>

<s>U Thant of Burma
the appointment of U Thant of Burma as the U.N.'s Acting Secretary General -- at this writing , the choice appears to be certain -- offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends .</s>

<s>Mongi Slim of Tunisia and Frederick Boland of Ireland were early favorites in the running , but France didn't like the former and the Soviet Union would have none of the latter .</s>

<s>with the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed Mr. Hammarskjold , U Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto .</s>

<s>what is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy .</s>

<s>in all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries' theme , the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat .</s>

<s>he has , moreover , another qualification which augurs well for the future .</s>

<s>he is a Buddhist , which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma , but a profound and unshakable Weltanschauung .</s>

<s>U Thant of course , will hold office until the spring of 1963 , when Mr. Hammarskjold's term would have come to an end .</s>

<s>whether the compromises -- on both sides -- that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen .</s>

<s>Mr. Khrushchev's demand for a troika is dormant , not dead ;
the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U Thant represents .</s>

<s>in a sense , the showdown promised by Mr. Hammarskjold's sudden and tragic death has been avoided ;
no precedents have been set as yet ;
structurally , the U.N. is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it .</s>

<s>but at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the Congo have been proved wrong .</s>

<s>to the hills , girls
.</s>

<s>no one who has studied the radical Right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade .</s>

<s>these are mentalities which crave action -- and they are beginning to get it , as Messrs. Salsich and Engh report on page 372 .</s>

<s>even in areas where political connotations are ( deliberately ?
)</s>

<s>left vague , the spirit of vigilantism is spreading .</s>

<s>Friends , a picture magazine distributed by Chevrolet dealers , describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the Gulf Telephone Company at Foley , Alabama .</s>

<s>if the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf Coast , the account reads , they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained telephone employees -- all girls .</s>

<s>heavily armed and mobilized as a fast-moving Civil Defense outfit , 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move into action at a minute's notice .</s>

<s>according to Friends , the unit was organized by John Snook , a former World War 2 commando who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company .</s>

<s>the girls , very fetching in their uniforms , are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck ;
they are also trained with carbines , automatic weapons , pistols , rifles and other such ladies' accessories .</s>

<s>this may be opera bouffe now , but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy .</s>

<s>the country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means .</s>

<s>the doctrine has never worked ;
it is not working now .</s>

<s>the official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms ;
it cannot bring them into actual play .</s>

<s>a more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined .</s>

<s>as the civic temper rises , the more naive citizens begin to play soldier -- but the guns are real .</s>

<s>soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst .</s>

<s>all false gods resemble Moloch , at least in the early phases of their careers , so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice .</s>

<s>but there is reason in all things , and in this country the heathenish cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands .</s>

<s>the annual butchery of 40,000 American men , women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive ;
a quota of 25,000 a year would be more than sufficient .</s>

<s>no other popular idol is accorded even that much grace .</s>

<s>if the railroads , for example , regularly slaughtered 25,000 passengers each year , the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety , for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the United States .</s>

<s>but by comparison with the railroad , the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship , so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily .</s>

<s>yet it is plainly time to make a start , and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic , without being fanatical .</s>

<s>here , then , is what Swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning .</s>

<s>from next New Year's Day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways , publicizing it on all media of communication .</s>

<s>to avoid suspicion of bigotry , let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five thousandth corpse ;
but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners .</s>

<s>then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution on July 4 , 1963 .</s>

<s>the scene , of course , should be nine miles northwest of Centralia , Illinois , the geographical center of population according to the census .</s>

<s>a special grandstand , protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of Illinois , should be erected for occupancy by honored guests , who should include the ambassadors of all those new African nations as yet not quite convinced that the United States is thoroughly civilized .</s>

<s>the band should play the Rogues' March as a processional , switching to Hail Columbia , Happy Land ]
as the trap is sprung .</s>

<s>Independence Day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the American article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights , the first of which is life , and when any government becomes subversive of that end , it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it .</s>

<s>the highway system is an agency of government , and when it grinds up 40,000 Americans every year the government is destroying its own taxpayers , which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do .</s>

<s>hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government , but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens , which would certainly alter it , and definitely for the better .</s>

<s>moreover , the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political , but at least partially , and perhaps primarily social .</s>

<s>it would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices -- for instance , the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon , not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis , or , as it is generally termed , staying put .</s>

<s>true , the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor , even a miniscule sect , and their credo , home-keeping hearts are happiest , is as disreputable as Socinianism .</s>

<s>nonetheless , although few in number they are a stubborn crew , as tenacious of life as the Hardshell Baptists , which suggests that there is some kind of vital principle embodied in their faith .</s>

<s>perhaps there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of Tarheelia , Robert Ruark's grandfather , who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is all this gallivantin' .</s>

<s>in any event , the yearly sacrifice of 40,000 victims is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the most ardent faith .</s>

<s>somehow our contemporary Moloch must be induced to see reason .</s>

<s>since appeals to morality , to humanity , and to sanity have had such small effect , perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example .</s>

<s>if we make it established custom that whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive , say beyond 25,000 per annum , then somebody is going to hang , it follows that the more eminent the victim , the more impressive the lesson .</s>

<s>to hang 50 governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related to the highways ;
so , all things considered , the highway commissioners would seem to be elected .</s>

<s>as the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth , the Soviet Union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race .</s>

<s>but the guilt is shared by the United States , Britain and France , the other members of the atomic club .</s>

<s>until Moscow resumed nuclear testing last September 1 , the J and J had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as the Russians , and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still coming down .</s>

<s>as it descends , the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body ;
for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies .</s>

<s>the effect of radiation is cumulative over the years -- and on to succeeding generations .</s>

<s>so , while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning , history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the West were so quick to assume when Mr. Khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat .</s>

<s>shock , dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions ;
a holier-than-thou sermon was not .</s>

<s>on October 19 , after the Soviets had detonated at least 20 nuclear devices , Ambassador Stevenson warned the J General Assembly that this country , in self protection , might have to resume above-ground tests .</s>

<s>more recently , the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission , Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg , admitted to a news conference in Las Vegas , Nevada , that the J might fall behind Russia ( he apparently meant in weapons development ) if the Soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain .</s>

<s>the trial balloons are afloat .</s>

<s>all of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood .</s>

<s>but for the average citizen , unfortunately , this is one of science's worst-marked channels , full of tricky currents and unknown depths .</s>

<s>the scientists , in and out of government , do not agree on some of the most vital points , at least publicly .</s>

<s>on the one hand , the Public Health Service declared as recently as October 26 that present radiation levels resulting from the Soviet shots do not warrant undue public concern or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the J .</s>

<s>but the J conceded that the new radioactive particles will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations , and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the United States .</s>

<s>then it added : it is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be -- nor how many people will be affected .</s>

<s>having hedged its bets in this way , J apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all : at present radiation levels , and even at somewhat higher levels , the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected .</s>

<s>then , to conclude on an indeterminate note : nevertheless , if fallout increased substantially , or remained high for a long time , it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world .</s>

<s>Dr. Linus Pauling , a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry , has been less ambiguous , whether you choose to agree with him or not .</s>

<s>after declaring , in an article last month in Frontier Magazine , that the Russian testing carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world , he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new Soviet shots totaled 200 megatons : the damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generations 160,000 children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects .</s>

<s>long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic , neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations , and between 200,000 and one million human beings now living would have their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia .</s>

<s>most of these would be in the Northern Hemisphere , where the fallout is concentrating .</s>

<s>Pauling's estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present series of Russian tests will probably turn out to be too high , but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility .</s>

<s>the lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups , from which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn .</s>

<s>but more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem .</s>

<s>its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing .</s>

<s>an illustration of this attitude is found in John A. McCone's letter to Dr. Thomas Lauritsen , reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the New Republic .</s>

<s>to this day the Atomic Energy Commission shies away from discussing the health aspects of fallout .</s>

<s>a recent study on radiation exposure by the J division of biology and medicine stated : the question of the biological effect of ( radiation ) doses is not considered herein .</s>

<s>of course , the J is in a bind now .</s>

<s>if it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout , it will box the President on resuming atmospheric tests .</s>

<s>so the Commission's announcements of the new Soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences , with the fission yield usually left vague .</s>

<s>now , of course , that the Russians are the nuclear villains , radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid , when the J was testing in the atmosphere .</s>

<s>the prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout , if not exactly good for you , might not be much worse than a bad cold .</s>

<s>after a nuclear blast , one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days , about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof .</s>

<s>things aren't that simple anymore .</s>

<s>yet if Washington gets too indignant about Soviet fallout , it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if America decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count .</s>

<s>how much fallout will we get ?</s>

<s>as of October 25 , the J had reported 24 shots in the new Soviet series , 12 of them in a megaton range , including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons ( the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of J ) ;
and President Kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported .</s>

<s>assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the Japanese at 10 megatons , a conservative computation is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60 megatons .</s>

<s>some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to 80 megatons , and that the full 50-megaton bomb that Khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated .</s>

<s>if the new Soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous Russian tests , the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion , meaning a fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far .</s>

<s>to this must be added the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that began in November , 1958 .</s>

<s>resuming atmospheric tests
one of the inescapable realities of the Cold War is that it has thrust upon the West a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas .</s>

<s>the first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself .</s>

<s>that dilemma is as much with us as ever .</s>

<s>the second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing , a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of Soviet tests .</s>

<s>when this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late '50's -- the United States appeared to have three choices .</s>

<s>it could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations .</s>

<s>it could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of Communist world domination .</s>

<s>or it could have chosen to find -- by negotiation -- some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security .</s>

<s>this third choice was in fact made .</s>

<s>with the resumption of Soviet testing and their intransigence at the Geneva talks , however , the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken .</s>

<s>once again , the United States must choose .</s>

<s>and once again , the choices are much the same .</s>

<s>only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder .</s>

<s>the first choice , abandoning tests entirely , would not only be unpopular domestically , but would surely be exploited by the Russians .</s>

<s>the second choice , full testing , has become even more risky just because the current Soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere .</s>

<s>the third choice , negotiation , presupposes , as Russian behavior demonstrates , a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable .</s>

<s>we take the position , however , that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us .</s>

<s>it is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable .</s>

<s>its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice ;
one which , should it fail , will not have contaminated the conscience .</s>

<s>that is the contamination we most fear .</s>

<s>leaving aside the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral , the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice .</s>

<s>for that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent Americans are now proposing .</s>

<s>in particular , Governor Nelson Rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests .</s>

<s>speaking recently in Miami , Governor Rockefeller said that to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent Soviet tests , we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests .</s>

<s>taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion , he argued that the responsibility of the United States is to do , confidently and firmly , not what is popular , but what is right .</s>

<s>what was missing in the Governor's argument , as in so many similar arguments , was a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what is right .</s>

<s>the possibility , as he asserted , that the Russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise -- unless , of course , we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand .</s>

<s>besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the Governor's case , one can ask seriously whether our lead over the Russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary .</s>

<s>recent statements by the President and Defense Department spokesmen have , to the contrary , assured us that our lead is very great .</s>

<s>unless the Administration and the Defense Department have been deceiving us , the facts do not support the assertion that we are compelled to resume atmospheric testing .</s>

<s>it is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may , at some point in the future , be necessary and even justifiable .</s>

<s>but a resumption does not seem justifiable now .</s>

<s>what we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the Soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations .</s>

<s>we now have to think not only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake .</s>

<s>this is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of Communism .</s>

<s>too often in the past Russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part .</s>

<s>there ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what Russia does .</s>

<s>the refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start .</s>

<s>ecumenical hopes
when his Holiness Pope John 23 first called for an Ecumenical Council , and at the same time voiced his yearning for Christian unity , the enthusiasm among Catholic and Protestant ecumenicists was immediate .</s>

<s>with good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided Christendom .</s>

<s>but as the more concrete plans for the work of the Council gradually became known , there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides .</s>

<s>the Council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the Church .</s>

<s>as it has turned out , however , the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses .</s>

<s>two things have happened in recent months to bring the Council into perspective : each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy .</s>

<s>first of all , it is now known that Pope John sees the renewal and purification of the Church as an absolutely necessary step toward Christian unity .</s>

<s>far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task , the Pontiff believes that a revivified Church is required in order that the whole world may see Catholicism in the best possible light .</s>

<s>equally significant , Pope John has said that Catholics themselves bear some responsibility for Christian disunity .</s>

<s>a major aim of the Council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the Church today stands in the way of unity .</s>

<s>secondly , a whole series of addresses and actions by the Pope and by others show that concern for Christian unity is still very much alive and growing within the Church .</s>

<s>the establishment , by the Holy Father , of a permanent Secretariat for Christian Unity in 1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern .</s>

<s>the designation of five Catholic theologians to attend the World Council of Churches assembly in New Delhi as official observers reverses the Church's earlier stand .</s>

<s>the public appeal by the new Vatican Secretary of State , Cardinal Cicognani , for renewed efforts toward Eastern and Western reunion was still another remarkable act .</s>

<s>nor can one forget Pope John's unprecedented meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury .</s>

<s>Augustin Cardinal Bea , the director of the Secretariate for Christian Unity , has expressed as directly as anyone the new spirit that pervades the Church's stance toward the Protestant and Orthodox Churches .</s>

<s>noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion , he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone .</s>

<s>for discouragement , or the temptation to abandon our efforts , would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the omnipotence of God , the irresistible efficacy of prayer , the action of Christ or the power of the Divine Spirit .</s>

<s>can any Christian fail to respond to these words ?</s>

<s>the budget deficit
the administration's official budget review , which estimates a 6.9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year , isn't making anyone happy .</s>

<s>certainly it isn't making the President happy , and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into its unbalanced condition , how he intends to economize wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next year .</s>

<s>we sympathize with Mr. Kennedy , but we feel bound to say that his budget review doesn't please us either , although for very different reasons .</s>

<s>furthermore , we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring .</s>

<s>in the first place , a large part of the discrepancy between President Eisenhower's estimate of a 1.5 billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing President's farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor .</s>

<s>the Eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received .</s>

<s>the rest of the deficit is also easily understood .</s>

<s>four billion dollars of the spending increase is for defense , an expenditure necessitated by the penny-wise policies of the Eisenhhower Administration , quite apart from the recent crises in Berlin and elsewhere .</s>

<s>four hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program , a responsibility similarly neglected by Mr. Eisenhower .</s>

<s>the farm program will cost an additional 1.5 billion , because of unusual weather factors , the Food for Peace program and other new measures .</s>

<s>anti-recession programs -- aid for the unemployed , their children and for depressed areas -- account for only 900 million of the 6.9 billion dollar deficit .</s>

<s>our complaint is that in many crucial areas the Kennedy programs are not too large but too small , most seriously in regard to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures .</s>

<s>and yet Mr. Kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of tightening up and economizing .</s>

<s>we wish the President would remember that fiscal responsibility was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election .</s>

<s>the party that won used to say something about a New Frontier .</s>

<s>ethics and peace
introduction of the dialogue principle proved strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting of the Catholic Association for International Peace in Washington the last weekend in October .</s>

<s>two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent Protestants , and when the speaker was a Catholic , one discussant on the dais tended to be of another religious persuasion .</s>

<s>several effects were immediately evident .</s>

<s>sessions devoted to Ethics and Foreign Policy Trends , Moral Principle and Political Judgment , Christian Ethics in the Cold War and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this procedure than if Catholics were merely talking to themselves .</s>

<s>usually questions from the floor were directed to the non-Catholic speaker or discussion leader .</s>

<s>in the earlier sessions there was plentiful discussion on the natural law , which Dr. William V. O'Brien of Georgetown University , advanced as the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgments on foreign policy .</s>

<s>that Aristotelean-Thomistic principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the participants , but in the end the concept came to reassert itself .</s>

<s>speakers declared that Protestants often make use of it , if , perhaps , by some other name .</s>

<s>a Lebanese Moslem told about its existence and application in the Islamic tradition as the divine law , while a C.A.I.P.</s>

<s>member who has been working in close association with delegates of the new U.N. nations told of its widespread recognition on the African continent .</s>

<s>the impression was unmistakable that , whatever one may choose to call it , natural law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence .</s>

<s>another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself .</s>

<s>the stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was undeniable .</s>

<s>it was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other's positions and better comprehension of one's own .</s>

<s>but a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed , and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues .</s>

<s>one effect of the spirited give-and-take of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts : knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest tactical atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use -- to defend Berlin , for example ;
the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account ;
it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the Christian imperative .</s>

<s>everywhere I went in Formosa I asked the same question .</s>

<s>I was searching for an accent of self-delusion or , even , of hypocrisy .</s>

<s>I never found it among any of the Chinese with whom I spoke , though granted they were , almost all , members of the official family who , presumably , harbor official thoughts .</s>

<s>but I questioned , also , professional soldiers , who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian's dreamy irredentism .</s>

<s>their answer was : it can be done , and we will do it .</s>

<s>and then I put the question as pointedly as I could directly to Chiang Kai-shek : in America , I said , practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the Mainland .</s>

<s>what evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that , and that it can be done ?</s>

<s>he smiled .</s>

<s>( he always smiles -- at least at visitors , I gather .</s>

<s>he smiled also at a British bloke seated next to me , who asked the most asinine questions .</s>

<s>I recalled sympathetically the Duke's complaint in Browning's My Last Duchess .
)</s>

<s>he smiled , and said a word or two to the interpreter , who turned to me , the President wonders where you are going after you leave Taipei ?</s>

<s>that , I smarted , is a royal rebuff if ever there was one .</s>

<s>I answered the routine question about my itinerary , rather coolly .</s>

<s>Chiang spoke again , this time at greater length .</s>

<s>the President says , the translator came in , that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in Southeast Asia , and that everywhere you went , you would seek the answer to your question .</s>

<s>he says that if he were to express to you , once again , his own profound determination to go to the Mainland , and his faith that that return is feasible , he would merely sound redundant .</s>

<s>so you yourself must seek these objective data , and come to your own conclusions .</s>

<s>any information we have here in Taiwan is at your disposal .</s>

<s>fair enough .</s>

<s>what are the relevant data ?</s>

<s>for every person on Taiwan , there are sixty in Mainland China .</s>

<s>if the raw population figures are crucially relevant , then it is idle to think of liberation , as idle as to suppose that Poland might liberate Russia .</s>

<s>relative military manpower ?</s>

<s>less than 60-1 , but at least 6-1 .</s>

<s>the estimates vary widely on the strength of the Chinese army .</s>

<s>say four million .</s>

<s>the armed forces of Taiwan are at a working strength of about 450,000 , though a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated .</s>

<s>skill ?</s>

<s>training ?</s>

<s>morale ?</s>

<s>it is generally conceded that the Formosan air force is the best by far in Asia , and the army the best trained .</s>

<s>the morale is very high .</s>

<s>even so , it adds up to impossible odds , except that the question arises , on whose side would the Mainland Chinese army fight ?</s>

<s>the miserable people of China , the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play , cannot themselves resist overtly .</s>

<s>they think , perforce , of physical survival : everything else is secondary .</s>

<s>but the army which Mao continues to feed well , where are its sympathies ?</s>

<s>the psychological strategists in Taiwan stress the great sense of family , cultivated in China over thousands of years .</s>

<s>it has not been extirpated by ten years of Communist depersonalization .</s>

<s>every soldier in the army has , somewhere , relatives who are close to starvation .</s>

<s>the soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion , it is assumed : but will their discontent spread to the officer class ?</s>

<s>the immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed : a despot does not economize on his generals .</s>

<s>but there are the cousins and aunts and nephews .</s>

<s>their privations are almost beyond endurance .</s>

<s>in behalf of what ?</s>

<s>Leninism-Marxism , as understood by Exegete Mao .</s>

<s>to whom will the generals stay loyal ?</s>

<s>there is little doubt if they had a secret ballot , they would vote for food for their family , in place of ideological purity out on the farm .</s>

<s>it is another question whether they -- or a single general , off in a corner of China , secure for a few ( galvanizing ?
)</s>

<s>days at least from instant retaliation -- will defy the Party .</s>

<s>but the disposition to rebel is most definitely there .</s>

<s>but there must be a catalytic pressure .</s>

<s>the military in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal .</s>

<s>the first was the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years .</s>

<s>the family is largely broken up ;
and where it is not , it is left with no residue , and the social meaning of this is enormous .</s>

<s>for it is the family that , in China , has always provided social security for the indigent , the sick , the down-and-out members of the clan .</s>

<s>now the government must do that ;
but the government is left with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordained .</s>

<s>thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged , and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security .</s>

<s>the second mistake is Tibet .</s>

<s>Tibet has historically served China as a buffer state .</s>

<s>a friendly state , sometimes only semi-independent , but never hostile .</s>

<s>China never tried to integrate Tibet by extirpating the people's religion and institutions .</s>

<s>Red China is trying to do this , and she is not likely ever to succeed .</s>

<s>Tibet is too vast , the terrain is too difficult .</s>

<s>Tibet may bleed China as Algeria is bleeding France .</s>

<s>these continuing pressures , social , economic and military , are doing much to keep China in a heightening state of tension .</s>

<s>the imposition of yet another pressure , a strong one , from the outside , might cause it to snap .</s>

<s>the planners in Taiwan struck me as realistic men .</s>

<s>they know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control .</s>

<s>first and foremost , they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the Communist regime .</s>

<s>on these they feel they can rely .</s>

<s>secondly , they depend on America's moral cooperation when the crucial moment arrives .</s>

<s>they hope that if history vouchsafes the West another Budapest , we will receive the opportunity gladly .</s>

<s>I remarked jocularly to the President that the future of China would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected American Liberals to Quemoy on an odd day .</s>

<s>he affected ( most properly ) not to understand my point .</s>

<s>but he -- and all of China -- wears the scars of American indecisiveness , and he knows what an uncertain ally we are .</s>

<s>we have been grand to Formosa itself -- lots of aid , and , most of the time , a policy of support for the offshore islands .</s>

<s>but our outlook has been , and continues to be , defensive .</s>

<s>a great deal depends on the crystallization of Mr. Kennedy's views on the world struggle .</s>

<s>the Free Chinese know that the situation on the Mainland is in flux , and are poised to strike .</s>

<s>there is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation .</s>

<s>the moment of truth is the moment of crisis .</s>

<s>during the slow buildup , the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details , fine words , strutting gestures .</s>

<s>the crisis burns these suddenly away .</s>

<s>there the truth is , open to eyes that are willing to look .</s>

<s>the moment passes .</s>

<s>new self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked bones .</s>

<s>a truth-revealing crisis erupted in Katanga for a couple of days this month , to be quickly smothered by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies .</s>

<s>before memory , too , clouds over , let us make a note or two of what could be seen .</s>

<s>the measure was instantly taken , as always in such cases , of public men at many levels .</s>

<s>one knows better , now , who has bone and who has jelly in his spine .</s>

<s>but I am here concerned more with policy than with men .</s>

<s>public men come and go but great issues of policy remain .</s>

<s>now , everyone knows -- or knew in the week of December 10 -- that something had gone shockingly wrong with American foreign policy .</s>

<s>the United States was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful , orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most pro-Western and anti-Communist within any of the new nations -- the only place in Africa , moreover , where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved .</s>

<s>of course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the United Nations .</s>

<s>but in the moment of truth everyone could see that the U.S. was in reality the principal .</s>

<s>the moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our J allies , to the entire Western community .</s>

<s>by our policy the West was -- is -- split .</s>

<s>but the key revelation is not new .</s>

<s>the controlling pattern was first displayed in the Hungary-Suez crisis of November 1956 .</s>

<s>it reappears , in whole or part , whenever a new crisis exposes the reality : in Cuba last spring ( with which the Dominican events of last month should be paired ) ;
at the peaks of the nuclear test and the Berlin cycles ;
in relation to Laos , Algeria , South Africa ;
right now , with almost cartoon emphasis , in the temporally linked complex of Tshombe-Gizenga-Goa-Ghana .</s>

<s>what the moments reveal
this prime element of the truth may be stated as follows : under prevailing policy , the U.S. can take the initiative against the Right , but cannot take the initiative against the Left .</s>

<s>it makes no difference what part of the world is involved , what form of regime , what particular issue .</s>

<s>the U.S. cannot take the initiative against the Left .</s>

<s>there is even some question whether the U.S. can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the Left .</s>

<s>we can attack Tshombe , but not Gigenza .</s>

<s>no matter that Gizenga is Moscow's man in the Congo .</s>

<s>no matter that it is his troops who rape Western women and eat Western men .</s>

<s>no matter that the Katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of Western interests in Africa .</s>

<s>( even granted that the Congo should be unified , you don't protect Western security by first removing the pro-Western weight from the power equilibrium .
)</s>

<s>we can force Britain and France out of the Suez , but we cannot so much as try to force the Russian tanks back from Budapest .</s>

<s>we can mass our fleet against the Trujillos , but not against the Castros .</s>

<s>we can vote in the J against South African apartheid or Portuguese rule in Angola , but we cannot even introduce a motion on the Berlin Wall -- much less , give the simple order to push the Wall down .</s>

<s>we officially receive the anti-French , Moscow-allied Algerian J , but we denounce the pro-Europe , anti-Communist J as criminal .</s>

<s>in the very week of our war against Katanga , we make a $133 million grant to Kwame Nkrumah , who has just declared his solidarity with the Communist bloc , and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian dictatorship .</s>

<s>as our planes land the war materiel that kills pro-Western Katangans , we stand supinely bleating while Nehru's troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our J ally , Portugal .</s>

<s>what explains this uni-directional paralysis ?</s>

<s>it is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international -- and in some degree our domestic -- policy .</s>

<s>the Suez-Hungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new Administration , but only made more consistent and more active .</s>

<s>key to the puzzles
most immediately relevant to these episodes in Goa , Katanga and Ghana , as to the Suez-Hungary crisis before them , is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of Asia , Africa and Latin America .</s>

<s>from this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the uncommitted ( neutralist , contested ) nations , especially on those whose leaders make the most noise -- Nehru , Tito , Nkrumah , Sukarno , Betancourt , etc.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in neutralist eyes .</s>

<s>if we grasp this orientation as a key , our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible .</s>

<s>and it becomes clear why in general we cannot take the initiative against the Left .</s>

<s>Broadway the unoriginals
to write a play , the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination , the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it .</s>

<s>nowadays , more and more , all he needs is someone else's book .</s>

<s>to get started , he does not scan the world about him ;
he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists .</s>

<s>so far this season , Broadway's premieres have included twice as many adaptations and imports as original American stage plays .</s>

<s>best from abroad .</s>

<s>of straight dramas , there are All The Way Home , which owes much of its poetic power to the James Agee novel , A Death In The Family ;
The Wall , awkwardly based on the John Hersey novel ;
Advise And Consent , lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller ;
Face Of A Hero ( closed ) , based on a Pierre Boulle novel .</s>

<s>the only original works attempting to reach any stature : Tennessee Williams' disappointing domestic comedy , Period Of Adjustment , and Arthur Laurents' clever but empty Invitation To A March .</s>

<s>clearly the most provocative plays are all imported originals -- A Taste Of Honey , by Britain's young ( 19 when she wrote it ) Shelagh Delaney ;
Becket , by France's Jean Anouilh ;
The Hostage ( closed ) , by Ireland's Brendan Behan .</s>

<s>among the musicals , Camelot came from T. H. White's The Once And Future King , and novels were the sources of the less than momentous Tenderloin and Do Re Mi .</s>

<s>Wildcat and The Unsinkable Molly Brown were originals , but pretty bad , leaving top honors again to an import -- the jaunty and charmingly French Irma La Douce .</s>

<s>the only other works at least technically original were dreary farces -- Send Me No Flowers ( closed ) , Under The Yum-Yum Tree , Critic's Choice .</s>

<s>in the forthcoming The Conquering Hero and Carnival , Broadway is not even adapting books , but reconverting old movies ( Hail The Conquering Hero and Lili ) .</s>

<s>dry of life .</s>

<s>originals are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily bad .</s>

<s>some memorable plays have been drawn from books , notably Life With Father and Diary Of Anne Frank .</s>

<s>and particularly in the musical field , adaptations have long been the rule , from Die Fledermaus and The Merry Widow to Oklahoma and My Fair Lady .</s>

<s>as critic Walter Kerr points out : adaptations , so long as they are good , still qualify as creative .</s>

<s>and other defenders invariably argue that , after all , Shakespeare and Moliere were adapters too .</s>

<s>the difference is that the masters took the bare frame of a plot and filled it with their own world ;
most modern adapters totally accept the world of a book , squeeze it dry of life , and add only one contribution of their own : stage technique .</s>

<s>the most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports is increasing production expense -- producers cannot afford to take chances .</s>

<s>but that explanation is only partly true .</s>

<s>off-Broadway , where production is still comparatively cheap , is proving itself only slightly more original .</s>

<s>laudably enough , it is offering classics and off-beat imports , but last week only one U.S. original was on the boards , Robert D. Hock's stunning Civil War work , Borak .</s>

<s>the real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of U.S. playwrights .</s>

<s>nightclubs the Cooch Terpers
he : come with me to the Casbah .</s>

<s>she : by subway or cab ?</s>

<s>that exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in Manhattan , as more and more New Yorkers were discovering 29th Street and Eighth Avenue , where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like Arabian Nights , Grecian Palace and Egyptian Gardens are the American inpost of belly dancing .</s>

<s>several more will open soon .</s>

<s>their burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd Street burlesque joints , but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always familial -- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis .</s>

<s>the belly boites , with their papier-mache palm trees or hand-painted Ionic columns , heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of Greek and Turkish families .</s>

<s>customers often bring their children ;
between performances , enthusiastic young men from the audience will take the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces .</s>

<s>except for the odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager Greek sailor , the people watch in calm absorption .</s>

<s>small , shirt-sleeved orchestras play in 2/4 or 4/4 time , using guitars , violins , and more alien instruments with names that would open Sesame : the oud , grandfather of the lute ;
the darbuka , a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass ;
the def , a low-pitched tambourine .</s>

<s>the girls sit quietly with the musicians , wearing prim dresses or plain , secretarial shifts , until it is time to go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem .</s>

<s>continuum of mankind .</s>

<s>if a dancer is good , she suggests purely and superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny -- the continuum of mankind .</s>

<s>but a great many of what Variety calls the Cooch Terpers are considerably less cosmic than that .</s>

<s>each dancer follows the ancient Oriental pattern -- she glides sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates , and , through breathing and muscle control , she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room .</s>

<s>this is done at varying speeds , ranging from the slow and fast Shifte Telli ( a musical term meaning double strings ) to the fastest , ecstatic Karshilama ( meaning greetings or welcome ) .</s>

<s>the New York dancers are highly eclectic , varying the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations , back bends or floor crawls .</s>

<s>but they do not strip .</s>

<s>the striptease is crass ;
the belly dance leaves more to the imagination .</s>

<s>when a dancer does well , she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills -- although the Manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips into the dancers' costumes .</s>

<s>with tips , the girls average between $150 and $200 a week , depending on basic salary .</s>

<s>although they are forbidden to sit with the customers , the dancers are sometimes proffered drinks , and most of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy .</s>

<s>the melting pot .</s>

<s>all over the country , belly clubs have never been bigger , especially in Detroit , Boston and Chicago , and even in small towns ;
one of the best dancers , a Turkish girl named Semra , works at a roadhouse outside Bristol , Conn. .</s>

<s>the girls are kept booked and moving by several agents , notably voluble , black-bearded Murat Somay , a Manhattan Turk who is the Sol Hurok of the central abdomen .</s>

<s>he can offer nine Turkish girls , plans to import at least 15 more .</s>

<s>but a great many of the dancers are more or less native .</s>

<s>sometimes they get their initial experience in church haflis , conducted by Lebanese and Syrians in the U.S. , where they dance with just as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs .</s>

<s>as the girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins , the melting pot has never bubbled more intriguingly .</s>

<s>some Manhattan examples : Jemela ( surname : Gerby ) , 23 , seems Hong Kong Oriental but has a Spanish father and an Indian mother , was born in America and educated at Holy Cross Academy and Textile High School , says she learned belly dancing at family picnics .</s>

<s>Serene ( Mrs. Wilson ) , 23 , was born in Budapest and raised in Manhattan .</s>

<s>daughter of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance , she is one of the few really beautiful girls in the New York Casbah , with dark eyes and dark , waist-length hair , the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe , glimmering body .</s>

<s>many belly dancers are married , but Serene is one of the few who will admit it .</s>

<s>Marlene ( surname : Adamo ) , 25 , a Brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from Arabic friends in Paris , now lives on Manhattan's West Side , is about the best belly dancer working the Casbah , loves it so much that she dances on her day off .</s>

<s>she has the small , highly developed body of a prime athlete , and holds in contempt the girls who just move sex .</s>

<s>Leila ( Malia Phillips ) , 25 , is a Greenwich Village painter of Persianesque miniatures who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles .</s>

<s>a graduate of Hollywood High School , she likes to imagine herself , as she takes the floor , a village girl coming in to a festival .</s>

<s>Gloria ( surname : Ziraldo ) , circa 30 , who was born in Italy and once did chorus work in Toronto , has been around longer than most of the others , wistfully remembers the old days when we used to get the seamen from the ships , you know , with big turtleneck sweaters and handkerchiefs and all .</s>

<s>but the ships are very slow now , and we don't get so many sailors any more .</s>

<s>the uptown crowd has moved in , and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck sweater for a button-down collar ?</s>

<s>a short , tormented span
of the handful of painters that Austria has produced in the 20th century , only one , Oskar Kokoschka , is widely known in the U.S. .</s>

<s>this state of unawareness may not last much longer .</s>

<s>for ten years a small group of European and U.S. critics has been calling attention to the half-forgotten Austrian expressionist Egon Schiele , who died 42 years ago at the age of 28 .</s>

<s>the critics' campaign finally inspired the first major U.S. exhibit of Schiele's works .</s>

<s>the show has been to Boston and Manhattan , will in time reach Pittsburgh and Minneapolis .</s>

<s>last week it opened at the J.</s>

<s>B.</s>

<s>Speed Museum in Louisville , at the very moment that a second Schiele exhibit was being made ready at the Felix Landau gallery in Los Angeles .</s>

<s>Schiele's paintings are anything but pleasant .</s>

<s>his people ( see color ) are angular and knobby-knuckled , sometimes painfully stretched , sometimes grotesquely foreshortened .</s>

<s>his colors are dark and murky , and his landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom .</s>

<s>but he painted some of the boldest and most original pictures of his time , and even after nearly half a century , the tense , tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its fascination .</s>

<s>the devil himself .</s>

<s>the son of a railway stationmaster , Schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy Danubian town of Tulln , 14 miles northwest of Vienna .</s>

<s>he was an emotional , lonely boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely any schoolwork .</s>

<s>when he was 15 , his parents finally allowed him to attend classes at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna .</s>

<s>even there he did not last for long .</s>

<s>cried one professor after a few months of Student Schiele's tantrums and rebellion : the devil himself must have defecated you into my classroom ]
for a while his work was influenced deeply by the French impressionists , and by the patterned , mosaic-like paintings of Gustav Klimt , then the dean of Austrian art .</s>

<s>gradually Schiele evolved a somber style of his own -- and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter .</s>

<s>his pictures were roundly denounced as the most disgusting things one has ever seen in Vienna .</s>

<s>he himself was once convicted of painting erotica and jailed for 24 days -- the first three of which he spent desperately trying to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle .</s>

<s>for years he wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars , was even driven to scrounging for cigarette butts in Vienna's gutters .</s>

<s>drafted into the Austrian army , he rebelliously rejected discipline , wangled a Vienna billet , went on painting .</s>

<s>it was not until the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking show .</s>

<s>melancholy obsession
.</s>

<s>the unabashed sexuality of so many of his paintings was not the only thing that kept the public at bay : his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved tragedy , and it was too much even for morbid-minded Vienna .</s>

<s>he was obsessed by disease and poverty , by the melancholy of old age and the tyranny of lust .</s>

<s>the children he painted were almost always in rags , his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness , and his nudes -- including several self-portraits -- were stringy , contorted and strangely pathetic .</s>

<s>the subject he liked most was the female body , which he painted in every state -- naked , half-dressed , muffled to the ears , sitting primly in a chair , lying tauntingly on a bed or locked in an embrace .</s>

<s>the most surprising thing about the Twenty-second Congress of the Soviet Communist Party is that it is surprising -- perhaps quite as much , in its own way , as the Twentieth Congress of 1956 , which ended with that famous secret report on Stalin .</s>

<s>the publication last July of the party's Draft Program -- that blueprint for the transition to communism -- had led the uninitiated to suppose that this Twenty-second Congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the Khrushchev regime , a solemn consecration of ideas which had , in fact , been current over the last three or four years ( i.e.</s>

<s>, since the defeat of the anti-party group ) in all theoretical party journals .</s>

<s>these never ceased to suggest that if , in the eyes of Marx and Lenin full communism was still a very distant ideal , the establishment of a Communist society had now , under Khrushchev , become an immediate and tangible reality .</s>

<s>it seems that Khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution to Marxist doctrine with his Draft Program ( a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent Congress was , in fact , very largely a rehash of that interminable document ) .</s>

<s>he and other Soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas , such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an All People's State , and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater democratization of the whole hierarchy of Soviets , starting with the Supreme Soviet itself .</s>

<s>their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at bureaucracy and would enable the people to take a more direct and active part in running the country .</s>

<s>also , elections would be more democratic ;
there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from .</s>

<s>no doubt , there was still a lot in the Draft Program -- and in Khrushchev's speech -- which left many points obscure .</s>

<s>was it the party's intention , for example , to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning kolkhozes , i.e.</s>

<s>, state farms ( which were , moreover , to be progressively urbanized ) ?</s>

<s>as we know , the Soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot ;
and it is still very far from certain how valid the party's claim is that in a growing number of kolkhozes the peasants are finding it more profitable , to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm .</s>

<s>if one follows the reports of the Congress , one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter .</s>

<s>the Draft Program was interesting in other respects , too .</s>

<s>it contained , for example , a number of curious admissions about the peasants , who enjoy no sickness benefits , no old-age pensions , no paid holidays ;
they still benefit far less than the other 50 per cent of the nation from that welfare state which the Soviet Union so greatly prides itself on being .</s>

<s>over all these fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was to skate rather lightly ;
and , though he repeated , over and over again , the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 , the ordinary people in Russia are still a little uncertain as to how communism is really going to work in practice , especially in respect of food .</s>

<s>would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry ?</s>

<s>this was something on which K. himself seemed to have some doubts ;
for he kept on threatening that he would pull the ears of those responsible for agricultural production .</s>

<s>and , as we know , the Virgin Lands are not producing as much as Khrushchev had hoped .</s>

<s>one cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of Khrushchev's agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big surprises provided by this Congress -- the obsessive harping on the crimes and misdeeds of the anti-party group -- Molotov , Malenkov , Kaganovich and others -- including the eighty-year-old Marshal Voroshilov .</s>

<s>Molotov , in particular , is being charged with all kinds of sins -- especially with wanting to cut down free public services , to increase rents and fares ;
in fact , with having been against all the more popular features of the Khrushchev welfare state .</s>

<s>the trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story : what , in the secret councils of the Kremlin , Molotov had really proposed , we just don't know , and he has had no chance to reply .</s>

<s>but one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated anti-party group would be totally unnecessary if there were not , inside the party , some secret but genuine opposition to Khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds , on the actual methods to be employed in the transition to communism and , last but not least , on foreign policy .</s>

<s>the whole problem of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition with the capitalist world is in the very center of this Congress .</s>

<s>Mikoyan declared : Molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful coexistence , reducing this concept merely to the state of peace or rather , the absence of war at a given moment , and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war .</s>

<s>his views , in fact , coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence , who look upon it merely as a variant of the cold war or of an armed peace .</s>

<s>one cannot help wondering whether Molotov and the rest of the anti-party group are not being used as China's whipping-boys by Khrushchev and his faithful followers .</s>

<s>for something , clearly , has gone very , very seriously wrong in Soviet-Chinese relations , which were never easy , and have now deteriorated .</s>

<s>the effect of Chou En-lai's clash with Khrushchev , together with the everlasting attacks on Molotov & Co. , has shifted the whole attention of the world , including that of the Soviet people , from the epoch-making twenty-year program to the present Soviet-Chinese conflict .</s>

<s>not only , as we know , did Chou En-lai publicly treat Khrushchev's attack on Albania as something that we cannot consider as a serious Marxist-Leninist approach to the problem ( i.e.</s>

<s>, as something thoroughly dictatorial and undemocratic ) , but the Albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to Khrushchev , calling him a liar , a bully , and so on .</s>

<s>it is extremely doubtful that the handful of Albanians who call themselves Communists could have done this without the direct approval of their Chinese friends .</s>

<s>the big question is whether , in the name of a restored Chinese-Soviet solidarity , the Chinese will choose to persuade the Albanians to present their humble apologies to Khrushchev -- or get rid of Enver Hoxa .</s>

<s>these seem about the only two ways in which the unhappy incident can now be closed .</s>

<s>but Albania is merely a symptom of a real malaise between China and Russia .</s>

<s>there are other symptoms .</s>

<s>Khrushchev , for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism , is genuinely favorable to peaceful coexistence and would like , above all , the Berlin and German problems to be settled peacefully ;
he knows that he was never more popular than at the time of the Russo-American honeymoon of 1959 .</s>

<s>but it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere -- in the first place from China , but perhaps also from that China Lobby which , I was assured in Moscow nearly two years ago , exists on the quiet inside the party .</s>

<s>to these people , solidarity and unity with China should be the real basis of Russia's future policy .</s>

<s>and the Chinese , as the Albanian incident shows , have strong suspicions that Khrushchev is anxious to secure a shameful peace with the West .</s>

<s>the fact that China ( which is obsessed by Formosa -- to Khrushchev a very small matter ) should be supported by North Korea and North Vietnam is highly indicative .</s>

<s>and one cannot but wonder whether Marshal Malinovsky , who was blowing hot and cold , exalting peace but also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against the West , wasn't trying to keep the Chinese quiet .</s>

<s>and this brings us inevitably to the 30- or 50-megaton bomb .</s>

<s>was not this dropped primarily in order to appease the Chinese -- especially after Khrushchev's humiliating surrender to the West in canceling the German peace-treaty deadline of December 31 ?</s>

<s>what does it all add up to ?</s>

<s>indications are that Khrushchev ( and , with him , the bulk of the Soviet people ) favor peaceful coexistence and ( with the exception of Berlin ) the maintenance of the status quo in the world .</s>

<s>the Chinese , North Vietnamese and North Koreans , on the other hand , feel that , militarily , Russia is strong enough to support them in the just wars of liberation they would like to embark on before long : with China attacking Formosa and the North Koreans and North Vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective countries .</s>

<s>perhaps Khrushchev is in a more difficult position than any since 1957 , when the anti-party group nearly liquidated him .</s>

<s>he seems strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition ;
but if he is up against China's crusading spirit in world affairs , he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice in his life .</s>

<s>he may support China ( but he won't ) ;
he may break with China ( which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous ) , or he may succeed , by all kinds of dangerous concessions , in persuading China to be patient .</s>

<s>the next days may show where things stand .</s>

<s>on a misty Sunday morning last month , a small band of militant anti-Communists called the Minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field about fifteen miles east of here .</s>

<s>eleven men , a woman and a teen-age boy tramped over cold , damp , fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare .</s>

<s>to the average American , this must sound like an incredible tale from a Saturday night J movie .</s>

<s>but to the Minutemen , this is a serious business .</s>

<s>they feel that the United States is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy .</s>

<s>they feel that World War 3 has already begun , and they are setting themselves up as a last line of defense against the Communist advance .</s>

<s>their national leader , Robert Bolivar DePugh of Norborne , Mo.</s>

<s>, says the Minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best suited to defeat the Red onslaught .</s>

<s>in their maneuvers last month , they wore World War 2 camouflage garb and helmets , and carried unloaded J rifles .</s>

<s>the maneuvers were held in secret after a regional seminar for the Minutemen , held in nearby Shiloh , Ill. , had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs , who had arrested regional leader Richard Lauchli of Collinsville , Ill. , and seized four operative weapons , including a Browning machine gun , two Browning automatic rifles and an J rifle .</s>

<s>undismayed by this contretemps , a small band of the faithful gathered at Lauchli's home at 6:30 A.M. the next day , put on their uniforms , and headed for a farm several miles away .</s>

<s>a 60 mm.</s>

<s>mortar and a 57 mm.</s>

<s>recoilless rifle owned by Lauchli were brought along .</s>

<s>the mortar was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated .</s>

<s>after a tortuous drive in an open truck and a World War 2 army jeep down soggy trails , the band arrived at a small clearing squeezed between a long , low ridge and a creek-filled gully .</s>

<s>here the two leaders , DePugh and Lauchli , hastened to put the group through its paces .</s>

<s>the Minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain for concealment .</s>

<s>they were shown how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge .</s>

<s>they practiced movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades ;
and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment .</s>

<s>eleven dummy rounds were fired by Lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar shooting .</s>

<s>Mrs. DePugh , the mother of five children and an active member of her husband's organization , participated in all the exercises .</s>

<s>there were no casualties , but the guerrillas admitted to being a little tired when the leaders called a halt at 9 A.M. to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane .</s>

<s>tenure as criterion
I would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by Russell Kirk ( Dec. 16 ) .</s>

<s>it has to do with teachers' salaries and tenure .</s>

<s>next September , after receiving a degree from Yale's Master of Arts in Teaching Program , I will be teaching somewhere -- that much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics teachers .</s>

<s>I will also be underpaid .</s>

<s>the amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers .</s>

<s>teaching is at present a sellers' market ;
as a result buyers , the public , must be satisfied with second-rate teachers .</s>

<s>but this is not the real problem ;
the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather than quality .</s>

<s>hence all teachers , good and bad , who have been teaching for a given number of years are paid the same salary .</s>

<s>I am firmly convinced that considering the average quality of teachers in this country , the profession is grossly overpaid .</s>

<s>it follows that teachers as a group cannot expect any marked salary increases ;
there is a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance .</s>

<s>the only hope which good teachers have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them .</s>

<s>the only hope which the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis of merit rather than tenure .</s>

<s>here , as in all sectors of the economy , quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses .</s>

<s>loss of initiative

<s>a brief for the negative
I disagree with Mr. Burnham's position on the Common Market ( Nov. 18 ) as a desirable organization for us to join .</s>

<s>for him to ignore the political consequences involved in an Atlantic Union of this kind is difficult to understand .</s>

<s>the pressure for our entry to the Common Market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade union by way of a purely economic thoroughfare , or garden path , with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background .</s>

<s>the appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation to political and legal , as well as economic , self-rule .</s>

<s>in entering this union we will be surrendering most , if not all , of our economic autonomy to international bodies such as the Atlantic Institute ( recently set up ) or the O.E.C.D.</s>

<s>, I.M.F.</s>

<s>and others .</s>

<s>to think that we can merely relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political or legal autonomy is wishful thinking .</s>

<s>if it is not enough that all of our internationalist One Worlders are advocating that we join this market , I refer you to an article in the New York Times' magazine section ( Nov. 12 , 1961 ) , by Mr. Eric Johnston , entitled We Must Join The Common Market .</s>

<s>he says : it has swept aside petty nationalisms , age-old rivalries , and worn-out customs .</s>

<s>referring to Britain , he says , we see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its economy , placing this authority in Continental hands .</s>

<s>since the goal of our international planners is a World Government , this Atlantic Community would mark a giant step in that direction for , once American economic autonomy is absorbed , a larger grouping is a question of time .</s>

<s>frankly , it is being very cleverly done for , in a sense , they have us over a barrel .</s>

<s>listen to what Mr. Johnston has to say : consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict .</s>

<s>we would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports we need .</s>

<s>we would be crippled by reduced output , industrial decline , widespread unemployment .</s>

<s>but the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation of the United States into an Atlantic Community or economic empire , but merely what libertarians like Henry Hazlitt and Ludwig Von Mises have been arguing for years : an end to government regulations , an end to government competition in industry , and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry .</s>

<s>create a free market here , give us a sound , debt-free money system , and we'll compete with anyone , Europe and Asia combined .</s>

<s>in short , get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won't have to worry about European competition or Communism either .</s>

<s>if we want to preserve our sovereignty , this is the way to do it ;
not acquiesce to an international planning board .</s>

<s>if we go into this Common Market , we might just as well stop talking about Constitutional guarantees , Connally Amendments or , for that matter , conservatism in general .</s>

<s>we don't need this type of protection any more .</s>

<s>the public is now armed with sophistication and numerous competing media .</s>

<s>besides , there are no longer enough corruptible journalists about .</s>

<s>the accepted method of writing news has two major liabilities .</s>

<s>first , it does not communicate .</s>

<s>a reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements of both sides in a major labor dispute , for instance , is unable to tell his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute .</s>

<s>second , it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous .</s>

<s>the charges by the late junior Senator from Wisconsin not only destroyed innocent people but misled the nation .</s>

<s>yet the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective in its news columns .</s>

<s>despite several years of front-page stories , the average citizen was unable to get a complete picture of McCarthy until he saw on the television screen what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way of communicating .</s>

<s>the Senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions .</s>

<s>it seems to me the time has come for the American press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve their own ends .</s>

<s>the objective should be to provide a method of getting into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporters and editors .</s>

<s>Southern California blackout
I would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning President Kennedy's activities , so far as Southern California is concerned .</s>

<s>you have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent opinions .</s>

<s>to begin with , the all-powerful Los Angeles Times does not publish a transcript of these press conferences .</s>

<s>I am sure that they did when Eisenhower was President .</s>

<s>next , because of the time differential , the conferences come on the networks during the middle of the day .</s>

<s>up until now , the networks have grudgingly run half-hour tapes at 5 P.M. or sometimes 7 or 10:30 P.M. .</s>

<s>even then , a few of the less interesting questions are edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator .</s>

<s>however , last night the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got on J were a few snatches which Douglas Edwards and Huntley and Brinkley could squeeze into their programs .</s>

<s>this is no criticism of them , as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute news summary .</s>

<s>the radio stations did run transcripts ( I thought ) during the evening hours .</s>

<s>however , by comparing the J snatches , two different radio station re-runs , and the censored Los Angeles Times version , I found that the radio stations had edited out questions ( ABC removed the one regarding Laos ) or even a paragraph out of the middle of the President's answer .</s>

<s>I am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country about the abuse he is being subjected to .</s>

<s>we out here don't see enough of the conference to know he is being abused .</s>

<s>I don't know if this is the situation in other parts of the country ;

<s>it also happened with the Inauguration , which was not re-run at all during the evening hours , and I wrote to the J editor of the Times .</s>

<s>he did mention in his column the fact that he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand the networks and the independent local stations' not doing this -- but nothing happened .</s>

<s>can you bring the networks' attention to this ?</s>

<s>for a college of propaganda

<s>( J , Feb. 11 ) .</s>

<s>in my estimation , we definitely do ;
and the sad part of it is that we had one , which was rounding into excellent shape , and we let it disintegrate and die .</s>

<s>during the war , we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare , which included the teaching of propaganda , both black and white and the various shades of grey in between .</s>

<s>we had a couple of schools in this country , the principal one being on the Marshall Field estate out in Lloyd's Neck .</s>

<s>there were also a couple in Canada , and several in England .</s>

<s>the English schools preceded ours , and by the time we got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda and its teaching .</s>

<s>four of us here in the United States attended , first as students , then as instructors , almost every one of these schools , in England , Canada , and the United States .</s>

<s>we set up the Lloyd's Neck school , worked out its curriculum , and taught there .</s>

<s>toward the end of the war , we really felt that we had learned something about propaganda and how to teach it .</s>

<s>when the end did come , and the schools were disbanded and abandoned , we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust .</s>

<s>we hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year or so .</s>

<s>alas , no such thing happened .</s>

<s>there apparently is no school of propaganda or psychological warfare .</s>

<s>a study at the Pentagon and at the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there .</s>

<s>and not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way .</s>

<s>whether in his forthcoming book C. P. Snow commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily autobiographical critic charged him is important .</s>

<s>one should be able to get hold of the book at once .</s>

<s>but the attack was made from an advance copy .</s>

<s>if this practice should take root and spread , the man who submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality .</s>

<s>editor's note : Sir Robert Watson-Watt wrote , on page 50 of SR Research for 4 March 1961 :
I have read an advance copy of the Snow book which is to be titled , Science And Government .</s>

<s>until the work actually appears I am not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail .</s>

<s>but I have compared its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of Godkin lectures at Harvard , from which the book was derived , and I can with confidence challenge the gist of C. P. Snow's incautious tale .</s>

<s>Watson-Watt's remarks in SR did not then , constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the Godkin Lectures .</s>

<s>representatives of Harvard University Press , which is publishing the book this month of April , recognize and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction by allowing Life magazine to print an excerpt from the book in advance of the book's publication date .</s>

<s>the text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the prepublication excerpt .</s>

<s>Sir Robert Watson-watt's rebuttal of Sir Charles Snow's Godkin Lectures is marred throughout by too forceful a desire to defend Lindemann and apparently himself from Sir Charles' supposed falsehoods while stating those falsehoods in an unclear incoherent argument .</s>

<s>the article presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning .</s>

<s>it calls the conclusion admitted valid by historians and military strategists alike a perverted conclusion .</s>

<s>nonsense .</s>

<s>it submits an enthusiastic , impressionistic conception of Lindemann contributing another aspect of the man , but on no more authoritative basis than Sir Charles' account .</s>

<s>we are left to choose between the two Lindemanns .</s>

<s>the only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea party .</s>

<s>but we are to believe that Lindemann actively supported radar outside the Tizard Committee , and dissembling , discounted it inside ?</s>

<s>if so , I would lean to Sir Charles' conception of the man .</s>

<s>I think it was a grave error to print the article at this time .</s>

<s>to the unfortunate people unable to attend the Godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some people from reading it .</s>

<s>it is not news that Nathan Milstein is a wizard of the violin .</s>

<s>certainly not in Orchestra Hall where he has played countless recitals , and where Thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra , playing the Brahms Concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high , pale , pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music , or forever finds it closed .</s>

<s>there was about that song something incandescent , for this Brahms was Milstein at white heat .</s>

<s>not the noblest performance we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent .</s>

<s>those would be reserved for the orchestra's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself .</s>

<s>this time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood .</s>

<s>but he had in Walter Hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point .</s>

<s>that is , when Mr. Milstein thrust straight to the core of the music , sparks flying , bow shredding , violin singing , glittering and sometimes spitting , Mr. Hendl could go along .</s>

<s>but Mr. Hendl does not go straight to any point .</s>

<s>he flounders and lets music sprawl .</s>

<s>there was in the Brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist , orchestra and music to ultimate fusion .</s>

<s>so we had some dazzling and memorable Milstein , but not great Brahms .</s>

<s>the concert opened with another big romantic score , Schumann's Overture to Manfred , which suffered fate , this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic point to keep it afloat .</s>

<s>Hindemith's joust with Weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune , for it demands transluscent textures , buoyant rhythms , and astringent wit .</s>

<s>Allied Arts had booked Marlene Dietrich into McCormick Place Dec. 8 and 9 .</s>

<s>something had to give .</s>

<s>not La Dietrich .</s>

<s>Allied Arts then notified us that the Kirov would cut short its Los Angeles booking , fly here to open Nov. 28 , and close Dec. 2 .</s>

<s>shorter booking , but still a booking .</s>

<s>we printed it .</s>

<s>a couple of days later a balletomane told me he had telephoned Allied Arts for ticket information and was told the newspapers had made a mistake .</s>

<s>so I started making some calls of my own .</s>

<s>these are the results .</s>

<s>the Kirov Ballet is firmly booked into the Shrine Auditorium , Los Angeles , Nov. 21 thru Dec. 4 .</s>

<s>not a chance of opening here Nov. 28 -- barring that miracle .</s>

<s>then why not the juicy booking Hurok had held for us ?</s>

<s>well , Dietrich won't budge from McCormick Place .</s>

<s>then how about the Civic Opera House ?</s>

<s>well , Allied Arts has booked Lena Horne there for a week starting Dec. 4 .</s>

<s>queried about the impasse , Allied Arts said : better cancel the Kirov for the time being .</s>

<s>it's all up in the air again .</s>

<s>so the Kirov will fly back to Russia , minus a Chicago engagement , a serious loss for dance fans -- and for the frustrated bookers , cancellation of one of the richest bookings in the country .</s>

<s>H E. Bates has scribbled a farce called Hark , Hark , The Lark ]
it is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season .</s>

<s>if there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans , it is hard to find .</s>

<s>perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare state in England still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics .</s>

<s>anyway , a number of them meet here in devastating collisions .</s>

<s>one is an imperial London stockbroker called Jerebohm .</s>

<s>another is a wily countryman called Larkin , whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled , I believe , in earlier volumes of Mr. Bates' comedie humaine .</s>

<s>what's up now ?</s>

<s>well , Jerebohm and his wife Pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities .</s>

<s>they want to own a junior-grade castle , or a manor house , or some modest little place where Shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for Great Elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers .</s>

<s>they are willing to settle , however , in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at .</s>

<s>and of course Larkin has just the thing they want .</s>

<s>splendor by sorcery
it's a horror .</s>

<s>the name of it is Gore Court , and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress T. S. Eliot .</s>

<s>that's not precisely the way Larkin urges them to look at it , though .</s>

<s>he conjures herds of deer , and wild birds crowding the air .</s>

<s>he suggests that Gore Court embodies all the glories of Tudor splendor .</s>

<s>the stained-glass windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas , the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform .</s>

<s>the vast , dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch .</s>

<s>Larkin has an answer to all that .</s>

<s>the spaciousness of the Tudor cooking areas , for example , will provide needed space for the extra television sets required by modern butlers , cooks and maids .</s>

<s>also , perhaps , table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented .</s>

<s>it's a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse .</s>

<s>he doesn't really need the immense sum of money ( probably converted from American gold on the London Exchange ) he makes them pay .</s>

<s>for Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot .</s>

<s>he has a glorious wife and many children .</s>

<s>when he needs money to buy something like , say , the Rolls-Royce he keeps near his vegetable patch , he takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies .</s>

<s>one of those capital-gains ventures , in fact , has saddled him with Gore Court .</s>

<s>he is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands .</s>

<s>and the Jerebohms are more than willing to buy it .</s>

<s>they plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox's life on earth .</s>

<s>first one , then the other
if , in Larkin's eyes , they are nothing but Piccadilly farmers , he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways of truly rural living .</s>

<s>Mr. Bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc .</s>

<s>oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war .</s>

<s>first the Larkins are ahead , then the Jerebohms .</s>

<s>after Larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants , he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers .</s>

<s>one of the local callers , a retired brigadier apparently left over from Kipling's tales of India , does not approve of the way Larkin gets his birds .</s>

<s>he doesn't think that potting them from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting .</s>

<s>but the brigadier dines on the birds with relish .</s>

<s>it is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel De Cervantes' Don Quixote is the brilliant Russian spectacle , done in wide screen and color , which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth Street and Sixty-eighth Street Playhouses .</s>

<s>more than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , Sancho Panza , in seventeenth-century Spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character .</s>

<s>Nikolai Cherkasov , the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible , performs the lanky Don Quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man .</s>

<s>his addle-brained knight-errant , self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as Cervantes no doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues .</s>

<s>Cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do .</s>

<s>he treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect .</s>

<s>directed by Grigory Kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow , he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world .</s>

<s>the complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted English language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the Russian dialogue .</s>

<s>the voices of all the characters , including that of Cherkasov , have richness , roughness or color to conform with the personalities .</s>

<s>and the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed .</s>

<s>since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish , there is no violation of artistry or logic here .</s>

<s>splendid , too , is the performance of Yuri Tolubeyev , one of Russia's leading comedians , as Sancho Panza , the fat , grotesque squire .</s>

<s>though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don , he gives it a firmness and toughness -- a sort of peasant dignity -- too .</s>

<s>it is really as though the Russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons .</s>

<s>the episode in which Sancho Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an island is one of the best in the film .</s>

<s>true , the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half , before Don Quixote goes to the duke's court .</s>

<s>but strength and poignancy develop thenceforth , and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy .</s>

<s>there are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the Russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange .</s>

<s>also on the bill at the Fifty-fifth Street is a nice ten-minute color film called Sunday In Greenwich Village , a tour of the haunts and joints .</s>

<s>television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz , which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family .</s>

<s>there seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of Chicago-style jazz in prime evening time , for example , could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary .</s>

<s>at least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for Chicago And All That Jazz , presented on J Nov. 26 .</s>

<s>the program came out of the J Special Projects department , and was slotted in the Du Pont Show Of The Week series .</s>

<s>perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines .</s>

<s>if so , it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department -- one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents .</s>

<s>as a matter of fact , this latter approach has already been tried , and with pleasing results .</s>

<s>a few years ago a Timex All-Star Jazz Show offered a broad range of styles , ranging from Lionel Hampton's big band to the free-wheeling Dukes Of Dixieland .</s>

<s>an enthusiastic audience confirmed the live character of the hour , and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance .</s>

<s>about that same time John Crosby's J series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do .</s>

<s>in an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement , a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods .</s>

<s>the program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music .</s>

<s>cameras stared at soloists' faces in extreme closeups , then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work .</s>

<s>Chicago And All That Jazz could not be faulted on the choice of artists .</s>

<s>some of the in-person performers were Jack Teagarden , Gene Krupa , Bud Freeman , Pee Wee Russell , Johnny St. Cyr , Joe Sullivan , Red Allen , Lil Armstrong , Blossom Seeley .</s>

<s>the jazz buff could hardly ask for more .</s>

<s>furthermore , Garry Moore makes an ideal master of ceremonies .</s>

<s>( he played host at the Timex show already mentioned .
)</s>

<s>one of the script's big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today .</s>

<s>NBC had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share .</s>

<s>for example , there was sheet music with the word jazz in the title , to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold .</s>

<s>samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession , like telephone poles passing on the highway , while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920's .</s>

<s>however well chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening's main business , which ( considering the talent at hand ) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago style .</s>

<s>another source of J pride was its rare film clip of Bix Beiderbecke , but this view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted out the entire glimpse .</s>

<s>similarly , in presenting still photographs of early jazz groups , the program allowed no time for a close perusal .</s>

<s>Chicago And All That Jazz may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer .</s>

<s>by trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today's artists , the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect example of either .</s>

<s>still , the network's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended , and future essays happily anticipated .</s>

<s>even Joan Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the Metropolitan Opera audience attending her debut as Lucia in Donizetti's Lucia Di Lammermoor Sunday night .</s>

<s>the crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as Miss Sutherland took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic Mad Scene created on her own and with the help of the composer and the other performers .</s>

<s>her entrance in Scene 2 , Act 1 , brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note .</s>

<s>thereafter the audience waxed applause-happy , but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain , her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization .</s>

<s>as she gained composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of Lucia .</s>

<s>she topped the sextet brilliantly .</s>

<s>each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the Mad Scene , but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment .</s>

<s>Miss Sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene : a much more girlish Lucia , a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing , and an actress immersed in her role .</s>

<s>what followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as Miss Sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today .</s>

<s>this big , flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined .</s>

<s>nervousness at the start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene , or she may warm up slowly .</s>

<s>in the fullness of her vocal splendor , however , she could sing the famous scene magnificently .</s>

<s>technically it was fascinating , aurally spell-binding , and dramatically quite realistic .</s>

<s>many years have passed since a Metropolitan audience heard anything comparable .</s>

<s>her debut over , perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine .</s>

<s>the performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor , Silvio Varviso .</s>

<s>he injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years .</s>

<s>he may respect too much the Italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes , but to restrain them in a singers' opera may be quite difficult .</s>

<s>Richard Tucker sang Edgardo in glorious voice .</s>

<s>his bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction .</s>

<s>the remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage direction proved only serviceable .</s>

<s>Miss Sutherland first sang Lucia at Covent Garden in 1959 .</s>

<s>( the first Metropolitan Opera broadcast on Dec. 9 will introduce her as Lucia .
)</s>

<s>she has since turned to Bellini , whose opera Beatrice Di Tenda in a concert version with the American Opera Society introduced her to New York last season .</s>

<s>she will sing La Sonambula with it here next week .</s>

<s>anyone for musical Ping-pong ?</s>

<s>it's really quite fun -- as long as you like games .</s>

<s>you will need a stereo music system , with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart , and one or more of the new London Phase 4 records .</s>

<s>there are 12 of these to choose from , all of them of popular music except for the star release , Pass In Review ( SP-44001 ) .</s>

<s>this features the marching songs of several nations , recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing stand .</s>

<s>complete with crowd effects , interruptions by jet planes , and sundry other touches of realism , this disc displays London's new technique to the best effect .</s>

<s>all of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program .</s>

<s>no reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner , and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music .</s>

<s>directionality is greatly exaggerated most of the time ;
but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix , there is excellent depth and dimension to the music .</s>

<s>you definitely hear some of the instruments close up and others farther back , with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back .</s>

<s>this is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound .</s>

<s>London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels .</s>

<s>these are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record .</s>

<s>in some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects .</s>

<s>some clue to the character of London's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word percussion or percussive .</s>

<s>drums , xylophones , castanets , and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well .</s>

<s>only too often , however , you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right .</s>

<s>they are definitely in the same room with you , but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a spirited volley .</s>

<s>the Percussive Twenties ( SP-44006 ) stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day , and Johnny Keating's Kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in Percussive Moods ( SP-44005 ) .</s>

<s>Big Band Percussion ( SP-44002 ) seemed one of the least attractive discs -- the arrangements just didn't have so much character as the others .</s>

<s>there is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recordings , apparently obtained at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies .</s>

<s>the penalty for this is noticeable in the big , bold , brilliant , but brassy piano sounds in Melody And Percussion For Two Pianos ( SP-44007 ) .</s>

<s>all of the releases , however , are recorded at a gratifyingly high level , with resultant masking of any surface noise .</s>

<s>Pass In Review practically guarantees enjoyment , and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system .</s>

<s>many Hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic , but not realistic .</s>

<s>strange , but true -- authenticity and realism often aren't related at all .</s>

<s>almost every film bearing the imprimatur of Hollywood is physically authentic -- in fact , impeccably so .</s>

<s>in any given period piece the costumes , bric-a-brac , vehicles , and decor , bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity .</s>

<s>the major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter .</s>

<s>during the making recently of an important Biblical film , some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only of costumes and interiors , but of architectural developments , sports arenas , vehicles , and other paraphernalia were compiled , consulted , and complied with .</s>

<s>but , alas , the authenticity seems to stop at the set's edge .</s>

<s>the drama itself -- and this seems to be lavishly true of Biblical drama -- often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at all .</s>

<s>the storyline , in sort , is wildly unrealistic .</s>

<s>thus , in The Story Of Ruth we have Ruth , Naomi , and Boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic .</s>

<s>but except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline -- i.e.</s>

<s>, that Ruth remained with Naomi and finally wound up with Boaz -- the film version has little to do with the Bible .</s>

<s>and in the new King Of Kings the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the Gospels .</s>

<s>earlier this month Edward R. Murrow , director of the United States Information Agency , came to Hollywood and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry .</s>

<s>he talked about unauthentic storylines too .</s>

<s>he intimated that they weren't doing the country much good in the Cold War .</s>

<s>and to an industry that prides itself on authenticity , he urged greater realism .</s>

<s>in many corners of the globe , he said , the major source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet .</s>

<s>would we want a future-day Gibbon or Macaulay recounting the saga of America with movies as his prime source of knowledge ?</s>

<s>yet for much of the globe , Hollywood is just that -- prime , if not sole , source of knowledge .</s>

<s>if a man totally ignorant of America were to judge our land and its civilization based on Hollywood alone , what conclusions do you think he might come to ?</s>

<s>Francois D'Albert , Hungarian-born violinist who made his New York debut three years ago , played a return engagement last night in Judson Hall .</s>

<s>he is now president of the Chicago Conservatory College .</s>

<s>his pianist was Donald Jenni , a faculty member at DePaul University .</s>

<s>the acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists , so that for the first half of the program , when the piano was partially open , Mr. Jenni's playing was too loud .</s>

<s>in vying with him , Mr. D'Albert also seemed to be overdriving his tone .</s>

<s>this was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances , however , except in the case of the opening work , Mozart's Sonata in J ( K. 526 ) , which clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion .</s>

<s>Brahm's Sonata in J , although also vigorous , stood up well under the two artists' strong , large-scale treatment .</s>

<s>Mr. D'Albert has a firm , attractive tone , which eschews an overly sweet vibrato .</s>

<s>he made the most of the long Brahmsian phrases , and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance .</s>

<s>a Sonata For Violin And Piano , called Bella Bella , by Robert Fleming , was given its first United States performance .</s>

<s>the title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer , who is also a member of the National Film Board of Canada .</s>

<s>the work's two movements , one melodically sentimental , the other brightly capricious , are clever enough in a Ravel-like style , but they rehash a wornout idiom .</s>

<s>they might well indicate conjugal felicity , but in musical terms that smack of Hollywood .</s>

<s>works by Dohnanyi , Hubay , Mr. D'Albert himself and Paganini , indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase .</s>

<s>standard items by Sarasate and Saint-Saens completed the program .</s>

<s>in recent years Anna Xydis has played with the New York Philharmonic and at Lewisohn Stadium , but her program last night at Town Hall was the Greek-born pianist's first New York recital since 1948 .</s>

<s>Miss Xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard , and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control .</s>

<s>and the tone she commands is always beautiful in sound .</s>

<s>since she also has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition , Miss Xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure .</s>

<s>she played with style and a touch of the grand manner , and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures .</s>

<s>the second half of her program was devoted to Russian composers of this century .</s>

<s>it was in them that Miss Xydis was at her best .</s>

<s>the Rachmaninoff Prelude No.</s>

<s>12 , Op.</s>

<s>32 , for instance , gave her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities -- the ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble .</s>

<s>the four Kabalevsky Preludes were also assured , rich in color and songful .</s>

<s>and the Prokofieff Seventh Sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that Prokofieff needs .</s>

<s>Miss Xydis' earlier selections were Mendelssohn's Variations Serieuses , in which each variation was nicely set off from the others ;
Haydn's Sonata in J minor , which was unfailingly pleasant in sound , and Chopin's Sonata in J flat minor .</s>

<s>a memory lapse in the last somewhat marred the pianist's performance .</s>

<s>so , what was the deepest music on her program had the poorest showing .</s>

<s>Miss Xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing .</s>

<s>all the generals who held important commands in World War 2 did not write books .</s>

<s>it only seems as if they did .</s>

<s>and the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written .</s>

<s>one of the very best is only now published in this country , five years after its first publication in England .</s>

<s>it is Defeat Into Victory , by Field Marshal Viscount Slim .</s>

<s>a long book heavily weighted with military technicalities , in this edition it is neither so long nor so technical as it was originally .</s>

<s>Field Marshal Slim has abridged it for the benefit of those who , finding not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves , are more interested in men and their reactions to stress , hardship and danger .</s>

<s>the man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is , of course , the Field Marshal himself .</s>

<s>William Joseph Slim , First Viscount Slim , former Governor General of Australia , was the principal British commander in the field during the Burma War .</s>

<s>he had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat of 1942 when the ill-prepared , ill-equipped British forces were outmaneuvered , outfought and outgeneraled .</s>

<s>he returned in command of an international army of Gurkhas , Indians , Africans , Chinese and British .</s>

<s>and in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles and hills and along the great rivers of Burma he waged one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war .</s>

<s>the Forgotten War his soldiers called the Burma fighting because the war in Africa and Europe enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines .</s>

<s>parts of Defeat Into Victory are a tangle of Burmese place names and military units , but a little application makes everything clear enough .</s>

<s>on the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book .</s>

<s>Field Marshal Slim is striking in description , amusing in many anecdotes .</s>

<s>he has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit mistakes and even a cardinal error .</s>

<s>he praises many individuals generously .</s>

<s>he himself seems to be tough , tireless , able and intelligent , more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers .</s>

<s>remaking an army to win
Defeat Into Victory is a dramatic and lively military narrative .</s>

<s>but it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high command , of decisions and their reasons , of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle action .</s>

<s>before he could return to Burma , Field Marshal Slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits .</s>

<s>his remarks about training , discipline , morale , leadership and command are enlightening .</s>

<s>he believed in making inspiring speeches and he made a great many .</s>

<s>he believed in being seen near the front lines and he was there .</s>

<s>for general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers , when food was short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly .</s>

<s>other crucial matters required constant supervision : labor and all noncombatant troops , whose morale was vital , too ;
administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with Top Brass -- British , American and Chinese ;
health , hygiene , medical aid and preventive medicine ;
hospitals ( inadequate ) and nurses ( scanty ) ;
food and military supplies ;
logistics and transport ;
airdrops and airstrips ;
roads and river barges to be built .</s>

<s>expected of a commander
commenting on these and other matters , Field Marshal Slim makes many frank and provocative remarks : when in doubt as to two courses of action , a general should choose the bolder .</s>

<s>the commander has failed in his duty if he has not won victory -- for that is his duty .</s>

<s>it only does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which others may have but which you cannot give them .</s>

<s>it depresses them .</s>

<s>so I made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some of it .</s>

<s>Field Marshal Slim is more impressed by the courage of Japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders .</s>

<s>of the Japanese private he says : he fought and marched till he died .</s>

<s>if 500 Japanese were ordered to hold a position , we had to kill 495 before it was ours -- and then the last five killed themselves .</s>

<s>brooding about future wars , the Field Marshal has this to say : the Asian fighting man is at least equally brave ( as the white ) , usually more careless of death , less encumbered by mental doubts , less troubled by humanitarian sentiment , and not so moved by slaughter and mutilation around him .</s>

<s>he is , by background and living standards , better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly , to demand less in the way of subsistence or comfort , and to look after himself when thrown on his own resources .</s>

<s>a bunch of young buckaroos from out West , who go by the name of Texas Boys Choir , loped into Town Hall last night and succeeded in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience .</s>

<s>actually , the program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded , and they sang it beautifully .</s>

<s>under the capable direction of the choir's founder , Geroge Bragg , the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds in an opening group of Renaissance and Baroque madrigals and motets , excerpts from Pergolesi's Stabat Mater and all of the Britten Ceremonial Of Carols .</s>

<s>their singing was well-balanced , clear and , within obvious limitations , extremely pleasing .</s>

<s>the limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices -- an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity , an occasional waver and now and then a bleat .</s>

<s>but Mr. Bragg is a remarkably gifted conductor , and the results he has produced with his boys are generally superior .</s>

<s>most surprising of all , he has accomplished some prodigies in training for the production of words .</s>

<s>the Latin , for example , was not only clear ;
it was even beautiful .</s>

<s>furthermore , there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music .</s>

<s>lines came out neatly and in good balance .</s>

<s>tempos were lively .</s>

<s>the piano accompaniments by Istvan Szelenyi were stylish .</s>

<s>a boy soprano named Dixon Boyd sang a Durante solo motet and a few other passages enchantingly .</s>

<s>other capable soloists included David Clifton , Joseph Schockler and Pat Thompson .</s>

<s>the final group included folk songs from back home , stomped out , shouted and chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume .</s>

<s>boys will be boys , and Texans will be Texans .</s>

<s>the combination proved quite irresistible last night .</s>

<s>the Polish song and dance company called Mazowsze , after the region of Poland , where it has its headquarters , opened a three-week engagement at the City Center last night .</s>

<s>a thoroughly ingratiating company it is , and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening .</s>

<s>not that it is all funny , by any means , though some of it is definitely so , but simply that the dancers are young and handsome , high-spirited and communicative , and the program itself is as vivacious as it is varied .</s>

<s>there is no use at all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title , for it has a kind of nonstop format , and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses for identification .</s>

<s>the material is all basically of folk origin , gleaned from every section of Poland .</s>

<s>but under the direction of Mira Ziminska-Sygietynska , who with her late husband founded the organization in 1948 , it has all been put into theatrical form , treated selectively , choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators , and performed altogether professionally .</s>

<s>under the surface of the wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training , and an equally professional sense of performing .</s>

<s>since the organization was created thirteen years ago , it is obvious that this is not the original company ;
it is more likely the sons and daughters of that company .</s>

<s>the girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters .</s>

<s>the stage is constantly full of them ;
indeed , there are never fewer than eight of them on stage , and that is only for the more intimate numbers .</s>

<s>they can be exuberant or sentimental , flirtatious or funny , but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull .</s>

<s>to pick out particular numbers is something of a problem , but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously excellent to be missed .</s>

<s>there is , for example , a stunning Krakowiak that closes the first act ;
the mazurka choreographed by Witold Zapala to music from Moniuszko's opera , Strasny Dwor' , may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see ;
there is an enchanting polonaise ;
and the dances and songs from the Tatras contain a magnificent dance for the men .</s>

<s>everywhere there are little touches of humor , and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth .</s>

<s>the Theatre-by-the-Sea , Matunuck , presents King Of Hearts by Jean Kerr and Eleanor Brooke .</s>

<s>directed by Michael Murray ;
settings by William David Roberts .</s>

<s>the cast : producer John Holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season's opener at Matunuck in Jean Kerr's King Of Hearts .</s>

<s>the dialogue is sharp , witty and candid -- typical don't eat the daisies material -- which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays , and it was obvious that the Theatre-by-the-Sea audience liked it .</s>

<s>the story is of a famous strip cartoonist , an arty individual , whose specialty is the American boy and who adopts a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material .</s>

<s>this is when his troubles begin , not to mention a fledgling artist who he hires , and who turns out to have ideas of his own , with particular respect to the hero's sweetheart-secretary .</s>

<s>John Heffernan , playing Larry Larkin , the cartoonist , carries the show in marvelous fashion .</s>

<s>his portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless .</s>

<s>this may be unfortunate , perhaps , from the standpoint of David Hedison , Providence's contribution to Hollywood , who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th Century-Fox .</s>

<s>not that Mr. Hedison does not make the most of his role .</s>

<s>he does , and more .</s>

<s>but the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist , and it has to be that way .</s>

<s>a word should be said for Gary Morgan , a Broadway youngster who , as the adopted son , makes life miserable for nearly everybody and Larkin in particular .</s>

<s>and for his playmate , Francis Coletta of West Warwick , who has a bit part , Billy .</s>

<s>on the whole , audiences will like this performance .</s>

<s>it is a tremendous book , lively , constantly moving , and the Matunuck cast does well by it .</s>

<s>the Newport Playhouse presents Epitaph For George Dillon by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton , directed by Wallace Gray .</s>

<s>the cast : the angriest young man in Newport last night was at the Playhouse , where Epitaph For George Dillon opened as the jazz festival closed .</s>

<s>for the hero of this work by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack of beer during a jam session .</s>

<s>he's mad at a world he did not make .</s>

<s>furthermore , he's something of a scoundrel , an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips .</s>

<s>this is in contrast to the family with whom he boards .</s>

<s>they not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well .</s>

<s>it is into this household , one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people , that George Dillon enters at the beginning of the play .</s>

<s>an unsuccessful playwright and actor , he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists .</s>

<s>by the end of the third act , the artist is dead but the body lingers on , a shell among other shells .</s>

<s>not altogether a successful play , Epitaph For George Dillon overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling .</s>

<s>it is awfully talky , for instance , and not all of the talk is terribly impressive .</s>

<s>but it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten .</s>

<s>there is a fine second act , as an example , one in which Samuel Groom , as Dillon , has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another .</s>

<s>this is an exciting young actor to watch .</s>

<s>just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is Laura Stuart , whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch .</s>

<s>Miss Stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish , almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment .</s>

<s>also fine are Sue Lawless , as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive , Harold Cherry , as her scratchy spouse , and Hildy Weissman , as a vegetable in human form .</s>

<s>Wallace Gray has directed a difficult play here , usually well , but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste .</s>

<s>still , his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance , despair .</s>

<s>the Warwick Musical Theater presents Where's Charley ?</s>

<s>with music and lyrics by Frank Loesser , directed by Christopher Hewett , choreography by Peter Conlow , musical direction by Samuel Matlowsky .</s>

<s>the cast : everybody fell in love with Amy again last night at the Warwick Musical Theater , and Shelley Berman was to blame .</s>

<s>one of the finest soft shoe tunes ever invented , Once In Love With Amy is also , of course , one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come out of American musical comedy in our era .</s>

<s>so the audience last night was all ears and eyes just after Act 2 got a rousing opening chorus , Where's Charley ?</s>

<s>, and Berman sifted out all alone on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering into being .</s>

<s>it is greatly to Berman's credit that he made no attempt to outdo Ray Bolger .</s>

<s>he dropped his earlier and delightful hamming , which is about the only way to handle the old war horse called Charley's Aunt , and let himself go with as appealing an Amy as anybody could ask .</s>

<s>in brief , Berman played himself and not Bolger .</s>

<s>the big audience started applauding even before he had finished .</s>

<s>the whole production this week is fresh and lively .</s>

<s>the costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture hats of the Gibson Girl days .</s>

<s>the ballet work is on the nose , especially in the opening number by The New Ashmolean Marching Society and Students' Conservatory Band , along with a fiery and sultry Brazilian fantasia later .</s>

<s>Berman , whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist , proved himself very much at home in musical comedy .</s>

<s>sparrow-size Virginia Gibson , with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile , made a suitably perky Amy , while Melisande Congdon , as the real aunt , was positively monumental in the very best Gibson Girl manner .</s>

<s>all told , Where's Charley ?</s>

<s>ought not to be missed .</s>

<s>it has a fast pace , excellent music , expert direction , and not only a good comedian , but an appealing person in his own right , Mr. Berman .</s>

<s>the book is by Jerome Weidman and George Abbott , music by Jerry Bock , lyrics by Sheldon Harnick , choreography by Peter Gennaro , scenery , costumes and lighting by William and Jean Eckart , musical direction by Jack Elliott , and the production was directed by Mr. Abbott .</s>

<s>the cast : this is one of the happier events of the season .</s>

<s>the company which performed the Pulitzer Prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce , the politicians are in fine voice , the chorines evoke happy memories , and the Little Flower rides to break a lance again .</s>

<s>I saw Fiorello ]
performed in New York by the original cast and I think this company is every bit as good , and perhaps better .</s>

<s>certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking .</s>

<s>Bob Carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to LaGuardia as Tom Bosley does , but I was amazed at the way he became more and more Fiorello as the evening progressed , until one had to catch one's self up and remember that this wasn't really LaGuardia come back among us again .</s>

<s>then Rudy Bond was simply grand as Ben , the distraught Republican Party district chieftain .</s>

<s>and Paul Lipson , as Morris , the faithful one who never gets home to his Shirley's dinner , was fine , too .</s>

<s>as for the ladies , they were full of charm , and sincerity , and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving , honest , little man .</s>

<s>Charlotte Fairchild was excellent as the loyal Marie , who became the second Mrs. LaGuardia , singing and acting with remarkable conviction .</s>

<s>Jen Nelson , as Thea , his first wife , managed to make that short role impressive .</s>

<s>and little Zeme North , a Dora with real spirit and verve , was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for Floyd , the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage , or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings .</s>

<s>such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of On The Side Of The Angels and Politics And Poker were handled splendidly , and I thought Rudy Bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made Little Tin Box even better than it was done by the New York cast ;
all the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity .</s>

<s>the party at Floyd's penthouse gave the chorines a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era's nonsense .</s>

<s>LaGuardia's multi-lingual rallies , when he is running for Congress , are well staged , and wind up in a wild Jewish folk-dance that is really great musical theater .</s>

<s>Martin Tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions .</s>

<s>not a corner has been visibly cut in this one .</s>

<s>the sets are remarkably elaborate for a road-show that doesn't pause long in any one place , and they are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness .</s>

<s>( several times recently I have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their eyes .</s>

<s>I'm glad to say there's none of that distraction in this Fiorello ]
) it has all been done in superb style , and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater .</s>

<s>Loew's theater presents Where The Boys Are , an J picture produced by Joe Pasternak and directed by Henry Levin from a screenplay by George Wells .</s>

<s>the cast : since the hero , a sterling and upright fellow , is a rich Brown senior , while two Yalies are cast as virtual rapists , I suppose I should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on Where The Boys Are , but I shall do nothing of the sort .</s>

<s>instead -- and not just to prove my objectivity -- I hasten to report that it's a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the Easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in Fort Lauderdale , and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group -- that is to say , sex .</s>

<s>the answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual .</s>

<s>if most of them weren't exactly specific -- well , that's the way it is in life , I guess .</s>

<s>but at least it's reassuring to see some teenagers who don't profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems instead .</s>

<s>Where The Boys Are also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy .</s>

<s>there are some sharp and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations -- the best of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a mermaid is performing .</s>

<s>most of the female faces are new , or at least not too familiar .</s>

<s>Dolores Hart , is charming in a leading role , and quite believable .</s>

<s>I was delighted with Paula Prentiss' comedy performance , which was as fresh and unstilted as one's highest hopes might ask .</s>

<s>a couple of the males made good comedy , too -- Jim Hutton and Frank Gorshin .</s>

<s>the only performance which was too soft for me was that of Yvette Mimieux , but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers , just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases , I suppose this was the attitude the part called for .</s>

<s>I must say , however , that I preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it .</s>

<s>to anyone who remembers Newport at its less than maximum violence , this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the Jazz Festival ought to prove entertaining .</s>

<s>the second feature , The Price Of Silence , is a British detective story that will talk your head off .</s>

<s>the superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of William James was never more evident than in his letters .</s>

<s>here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking .</s>

<s>to both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest , the same open-minded relish for what was unique in each , the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence , the same gallantry of judgment .</s>

<s>for this latest addition to the Great Letters Series , under the general editorship of Louis Kronenberger , Miss Hardwick has made a selection which admirably displays the variety of James's genius , not to mention the felicities of his style .</s>

<s>and how he could write ]
his famous criticism of brother Henry's third style is surely as subtly , even elegantly , worded an analysis of the latter's intricate air castles as Henry himself could ever have produced .</s>

<s>his letter to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant , forthright , and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up penned to a sensitive child , and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good humor .</s>

<s>most of all , his letters to his philosophic colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help to explain Whitehead's reference to James as that adorable genius .</s>

<s>Miss Hardwick speaks of his superb gift for intellectual friendship , and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism .</s>

<s>this is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where there seems to be an increasing lack of communication -- or even desire for communication -- between differing schools of thought .</s>

<s>it holds an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word intellectual has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues .</s>

<s>to his Harvard colleague , Josiah Royce , whose philosophic position differed radically from his own , James could write , different as our minds are , yours has nourished mine , as no other social influence ever has , and in converse with you I have always felt that my life was being lived importantly .</s>

<s>of another colleague , George Santayana , he could write : the great event in my life recently has been the reading of Santayana's book .</s>

<s>although I absolutely reject the Platonism of it , I have literally squealed with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position is laid down on page after page .</s>

<s>writing to his colleague George Herbert Palmer -- glorious old Palmer , as he addresses him -- James says that if only the students at Harvard could really understand Royce , Santayana , Palmer , and himself and see that their varying systems are so many religions , ways of fronting life , and worth fighting for , then Harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe .</s>

<s>the best condition of it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems .</s>

<s>the world might ring with the struggle , if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other .</s>

<s>the belaboring is of course jocular , yet James was not lacking in fundamental seriousness -- unless we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who stakes all on his vision of God .</s>

<s>to James this vision never quite came , despite his appreciation of it in others .</s>

<s>but there is a dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one correspondent : you ask what I am going to reply to Bradley .</s>

<s>but why need one reply to everything and everybody ?</s>

<s>I think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations .</s>

<s>all polemic of ours should , I believe , be either very broad statements of contrast , or fine points treated singly , and as far as possible impersonally .</s>

<s>as far as the rising generation goes , why not simply express ourselves positively , and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other .</s>

<s>here again God will know his own .</s>

<s>the collected works of James Thurber , now numbering 25 volumes ( including the present exhibit ) represent a high standard of literary excellence , as every schoolboy knows .</s>

<s>the primitive-eclogue quality of his drawings , akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall , is equally well known .</s>

<s>about all that remains to be said is that the present selection , most of which appeared first in The New Yorker , comprises ( as usual ) a slightly unstrung necklace , held together by little more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the book .</s>

<s>the one unifying note , if any , is sounded in the initial article entitled : How To Get Through The Day .</s>

<s>it is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs , the hospitalized , and others forced to rely on inner resources , including ( in the J alone ) palindromes , paraphrases , and parodies .</s>

<s>the Tyranny Of Trivia suggests arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber .</s>

<s>and new vistas of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled : Friends , Romans , Countrymen , Lend Me Your Ear-Muffs , such a phrase as Drifts Through Dream , and The New Vocabularianism .</s>

<s>some of Thurber's curative methods involve strong potions of mixed metaphor , malapropism , and gobbledygook and are recommended for use only in extreme cases .</s>

<s>a burlesque paean entitled : Hark The Herald Tribune , Times , And All The Other Angels Sing brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture ballyhooey .</s>

<s>How The Kooks Crumble features an amusingly accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-TV commercials , and The Watchers Of The Night is a veritable waking nightmare .</s>

<s>a semi-serious literary document entitled The Wings Of Henry James is noteworthy , if only for a keenly trenchant though little-known comment on the master's difficult later period by modest Owen Wister , author of The Virginian .</s>

<s>James , he remarks in a letter to a friend , is attempting the impossible namely , to produce upon the reader , as a painting produces upon the gazer , a number of superimposed , simultaneous impressions .</s>

<s>he would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you could read them all at once , and get all at once , the various shadings and complexities .</s>

<s>equally penetrating in its fashion is the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation : so much has already been written about everything that you can't find out anything about it .</s>

<s>or the mildly epigrammatic utterance ( also a quotation ) : woman's place is in the wrong .</s>

<s>who but Thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences ?</s>

<s>a tribute to midsummer bang-sashes seems terribly funny , though it would be hard to explain why .</s>

<s>one of them banged the sash of the window nearest my bed around midnight in July and I leaped out of sleep and out of bed .</s>

<s>it's just a bat , said my wife reassuringly , and I sighed with relief .</s>

<s>thank God for that , I said ;
I thought it was a human being .</s>

<s>in a sense , perhaps , Thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter ( was it Salvador Dali ?
)</s>

<s>who first conceived the startling fancy of a picture window in the abdomen .</s>

<s>that is , it is literally a picture window : you don't see into the viscera ;
you see a picture -- trees , or flowers .</s>

<s>this is something like what Thurber's best effects are like , if I am not mistaken .</s>

<s>though no longer able to turn out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches ( several old favorites are scattered through the present volume ) Thurber has retained unimpaired his vision of humor as a thing of simple , unaffected humanness .</s>

<s>in his concluding paragraph he writes : the devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can .</s>

<s>for many readers Thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight .</s>

<s>the latest Low is a puzzler .</s>

<s>the master's hand has lost none of its craft .</s>

<s>he is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions of political and diplomatic life in the fifties .</s>

<s>the reader meets a few old friends like Blimp and the J horse , and becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like the bomb itself , and civilization in her classic robe watching the nuclear arms race , her hair standing straight out .</s>

<s>but there is a difference between the present volume and the early Low .</s>

<s>there is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings show .</s>

<s>but there was terror in the thirties when the Nazis were on the loose and in those days Low struck like lightning .</s>

<s>anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference .</s>

<s>it might be argued that the Communists are less inhuman than the Nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key .</s>

<s>but this argument cannot be pushed very far because the Communist system makes up for any shortcomings of its leaders in respect to corrosion .</s>

<s>the Communists wield a power unknown to Hitler .</s>

<s>and the leading issue , that of piecemeal aggression , remains the same .</s>

<s>this is drama enough .</s>

<s>do we ourselves offer Mr. Low less of a crusade ?</s>

<s>in the thirties we would not face our enemy ;
that was a nightmarish situation and Low was in his element .</s>

<s>now we have stood up to the Communists ;
we are stronger and more self-confident -- and Low cannot so easily put us to rights .</s>

<s>or does the reason for less Jovian drawings lie elsewhere ?</s>

<s>it might be that Low has seen too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now .</s>

<s>he writes , Confucius held that in times of stress one should take short views -- only up to lunchtime .</s>

<s>whatever the cause , his mood in the fifties rarely rises above the level of the capably sardonic .</s>

<s>Dulles ?</s>

<s>he does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the man .</s>

<s>McCarthy ?</s>

<s>the skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their wrath .</s>

<s>Suez ?</s>

<s>Low seems to have supported Eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently , so there is no fire in his eye .</s>

<s>Stalin's death , Churchill's farewell to public life , Hillary and Tensing on Everest , Quemoy and Matsu -- all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade .</s>

<s>instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles .</s>

<s>their Eisenhower is insubstantial .</s>

<s>did Low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections ?</s>

<s>he often drew the bomb .</s>

<s>he showed puny men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines .</s>

<s>and Khrushchev turned out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all .</s>

<s>but , but and but .</s>

<s>look in this book for weak mortals and only on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale .</s>

<s>read the moderately brief text , not for captions , sometimes for tart epigrams , once in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas .</s>

<s>a gray fox with a patch on one eye -- confidence man , city slicker , lebensraum specialist -- tries to take over Catfish Bend in this third relaxed allegory from Mr. Burman's refreshing Louisiana animal community .</s>

<s>the fox is all ingratiating smiles when he arrives from New Orleans , accompanied by one wharf rat .</s>

<s>but like all despots , as he builds his following from among the gullible , he grows more threatening toward those who won't follow -- such solid citizens as Doc Raccoon ;
Judge Black , the vegetarian black snake ;
and the eagle , who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in Washington posing for fifty-cent pieces .</s>

<s>as soon as the fox has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats , who , of course , say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination campaign in the city .</s>

<s>( the followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others .
)</s>

<s>they train the mink and other animals to fight .</s>

<s>and pretty soon gray fox is announcing that he won't have anyone around that's against him , and setting out to break his second territorial treaty with the birds .</s>

<s>Robert Hillyer , the poet , writes in his introduction to this brief animal fable that Mr. Burman ought to win a Nobel Prize for the Catfish Bend series .</s>

<s>he may have a point in urging that decadent themes be given fewer prizes .</s>

<s>but it's hard to imagine Mr. Burman as a Nobel laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous fables .</s>

<s>in substance they lie somewhere between the Southern dialect animal stories of Joel Chandler Harris ( Uncle Remus ) and the polished , witty fables of James Thurber .</s>

<s>George Kennan's account of relations between Russia and the West from the fall of Tsarism to the end of World War 2 is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years .</s>

<s>it combines qualities that are seldom found in one work : scrupulous scholarship , a fund of personal experience , a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era's great historical issues .</s>

<s>in short , the book , based largely on lectures delivered at Harvard University , is both reliable and readable ;
the author possesses an uncommonly fine English style , and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time .</s>

<s>if Mr. Kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals , if his analysis of how Western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic -- well , the record itself is not too encouraging .</s>

<s>Mr. Kennan takes careful account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken .</s>

<s>but he rejects , perhaps a little too sweepingly , the theory that disloyal and pro-Communist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing Stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the Yalta Conference in February , 1945 .</s>

<s>after all , Alger Hiss , subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret State Department documents to Soviet agents , was at Yalta .</s>

<s>and Harry Dexter White , implicated in F.B.I.</s>

<s>reports in Communist associations , was one of the architects of the Morgenthau Plan , which had it ever been put into full operation , would have simply handed Germany to Stalin .</s>

<s>one item in this unhappy scheme was to have Germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors , among whom only the Soviet Union possessed real military strength .</s>

<s>it is quite probable , however , that stupidity , inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like unconditional surrender had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with Communism .</s>

<s>Mr. Kennan sums up his judgment of what went wrong this way : dashed hope
you see , first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills , the unshakeable American commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender : the tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status quo , but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil , with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought to the complete destruction of the enemy's power , no matter what disadvantages or complications this might involve for the more distant future .</s>

<s>recognizing that there could have been no effective negotiated peace with Hitler , he points out the shocking failure to give support to the anti-Nazi underground , which very nearly eliminated Hitler in 1944 .</s>

<s>a veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of Russian language , history and literature , Kennan recalls how , at the time of Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 , he penned a private note to a State Department official , expressing the hope that never would we associate ourselves with Russian purposes in the areas of eastern Europe beyond her own boundaries .</s>

<s>the hope was vain .</s>

<s>with justified bitterness the author speaks of what seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the Russian Communist movement , about the history of its diplomacy , about what had happened in the purges , and about what had been going on in Poland and the Baltic States .</s>

<s>he also speaks of Franklin D. Roosevelt's puerile assumption that if only he ( Stalin ) could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like F.D.R.</s>

<s>himself , ideological preconceptions would melt and Russia's co-operation with the West could be easily arranged .</s>

<s>no wonder Khrushchev's first message to President Kennedy was a wistful desire for the return of the good old days of Roosevelt .</s>

<s>this fascinating story begins with a sketch , rich in personal detail , of the glancing mutual impact of World War 1 and the two instalments of the Russian Revolution .</s>

<s>the first of these involved the replacement of the Tsar by a liberal Provisional Government in March , 1917 ;
the second , the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks ( who later called themselves Communists ) in November of the same year .</s>

<s>as Kennan shows , the judgment of the Allied governments about what was happening in Russia was warped by the obsession of defeating Germany .</s>

<s>they were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the Russian people fighting .</s>

<s>they attributed everything that went wrong in Russia to German influence and intrigue .</s>

<s>this , more than any other factor , led to the fiasco of Allied intervention .</s>

<s>as the author very justly says : had a world war not been in progress , there would never , under any conceivable stretch of the imagination , have been an Allied intervention in North Russia .</s>

<s>the scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated by Communist propaganda ;
here Kennan , operating with precise facts and figures , performs an excellent job of debunking .</s>

<s>plebian dictators
of many passages in the book that exemplify the author's vivid style , the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be selected .</s>

<s>on Stalin : this was a man of incredible criminality , of a criminality effectively without limits ;
a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love , without mercy or pity ;
a man in whose entourage none was ever safe ;
a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment ;
a man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators in crime .</s>

<s>and here is Kennan's image of Hitler , Stalin's temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weaker peoples , and his later enemy : behind that Charlie Chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead , behind the tirades and the sulky silences , the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare , behind the prejudices , the cynicism , the total amorality of behavior , behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes , there lay a statesman of no mean qualities : shrewd , calculating , in many ways realistic , endowed -- like Stalin -- with considerable powers of dissimulation , capable of playing his cards very close to his chest when he so desired , yet bold and resolute in his decisions , and possessing one gift Stalin did not possess : the ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word .</s>

<s>two criticisms of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges -- there is no mention of the Potsdam Conference or the Morgenthau Plan .</s>

<s>and in a concluding chapter about America's stance in the contemporary world , one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come to grips with the baffling riddle of our time : how to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war .</s>

<s>but one should not ask for everything .</s>

<s>Mr. Kennan , who has recently abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed American ambassador to Yugoslavia , is not the only man who finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future .</s>

<s>the story of a quarter of a century of Soviet-Western relations is vitally important , and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical narrator .</s>

<s>the Ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter political or domestic unrest , lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit and charm .</s>

<s>in Donnybrook , there is quite a different Eire , a rural land where singing , dancing , fist-fighting and romancing are the thing .</s>

<s>there is plenty of violence , to be sure , but it is a nice violence and no one gets killed .</s>

<s>by and large , Robert McEnroe's adaptation of Maurice Walsh's film , The Quiet Man , provides the entertainment it set out to , and we have a lively musical show if not a superlative one .</s>

<s>this is the tale of one John Enright , an American who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man .</s>

<s>but Innesfree , where Ellen Roe Danaher and her bullying brother , Will , live , is no place for a man who will not use his fists .</s>

<s>so Enright's courting of the mettlesome Ellen is impeded considerably , thereby providing the tale which is told .</s>

<s>you may be sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother , and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word Donnybrook means .</s>

<s>then there is a matchmaker , one Mikeen Flynn , a role for which Eddie Foy was happily selected .</s>

<s>now there is no reason in the world why a matchmaker in Ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs , torso and neck , except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play .</s>

<s>Mr. Foy is a joy , having learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically perfect .</s>

<s>his matchmaking is , naturally , incidental , and it only serves Flynn right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony .</s>

<s>Art Lund , a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice , impersonates Enright .</s>

<s>although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic technique , that's not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have , anyway .</s>

<s>Joan Fagan , a fiery redhead who can impress you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not , plays Ellen , and sings the role very well , too .</s>

<s>if the mettle which Ellen exhibits has a bit of theatrical dross in it , never mind ;
she fits into the general scheme well enough .</s>

<s>Susan Johnson , as the widow , spends the first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new one .</s>

<s>she has a good , firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening .</s>

<s>then there are a pair of old biddies played by Grace Carney and Sibly Bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock Irish characters , but they put such a combination of good will and malevolence into their parts that they're quite entertaining .</s>

<s>and in the role of Will Danaher , Philip Bosco roars and sneers sufficiently to intimidate not only one American but the whole British army , if he chose .</s>

<s>Donnybrook is no Brigadoon , but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some excellent dancing .</s>

<s>the ballads are sweet and sad , and the music generally competent .</s>

<s>it sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after the final curtain , and some of it , such as the catchy Sez I , does .</s>

<s>A Toast To The Bride , sung by Clarence Nordstrom , playing a character called Old Man Toomey , is quite simple , direct and touching .</s>

<s>the men of Innesfree are got up authentically in cloth caps and sweaters , and their dancing and singing is fine .</s>

<s>so is that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep under Jack Cole's expert choreographic direction .</s>

<s>the male dancers sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and stimulating .</s>

<s>Rouben Ter-Arutunian , in his stage settings , often uses the scrim curtain behind which Mr. Cole has placed couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow .</s>

<s>there is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time at Donnybrook , unless they are permanently in the mood of Enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable Irish .</s>

<s>we can all breathe more easily this morning -- more easily and joyously , too -- because Joshua Logan has turned the stage show , Fanny , into a delightful and heart-warming film .</s>

<s>the task of taking the raw material of Marcel Pagnol's original trio of French films about people of the waterfront in Marseilles and putting them again on the screen , after their passage through the Broadway musical idiom , was a delicate and perilous one , indeed .</s>

<s>more than the fans of Pagnol's old films and of their heroic star , the great Raimu , were looking askance at the project .</s>

<s>the fans of the musical were , too .</s>

<s>but now the task is completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the English-dialogue picture at the Music Hall yesterday .</s>

<s>whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show , whether partial to music or not , you can't help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart .</s>

<s>some of the New York Philharmonic musicians who live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow .</s>

<s>a tiny handful never did make the concert .</s>

<s>but , after a fifteen-minute delay , the substantially complete Philharmonic assembled on stage for the afternoon's proceedings .</s>

<s>they faced a rather small audience , as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon .</s>

<s>it was an excellent concert .</s>

<s>Paul Paray , rounding out his current stint with the orchestra , is a solid musician , and the Philharmonic plays for him .</s>

<s>their collaboration in the Beethoven Second Symphony was lucid , intelligent and natural sounding .</s>

<s>it was not a heavy , ponderous Beethoven .</s>

<s>the music sang nicely , sprinted evenly when necessary , was properly accented and balanced .</s>

<s>the Franck symphonic poem , Psyche , is a lush , sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again .</s>

<s>fortunate for the music itself , it is not too frequent a visitor ;
if it were , its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying .</s>

<s>Mr. Paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic elements of the score .</s>

<s>he did not let the strings , for instance , weep , whine or get hysterical .</s>

<s>his interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy .</s>

<s>and in the Prokofieff J major Piano Concerto , with Zadel Skolovsky as soloist , he was an admirable partner .</s>

<s>Mr. Skolovsky's approach to the concerto was bold , sweeping and tonally percussive .</s>

<s>he swept through the music with ease , in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner .</s>

<s>an impressive technician , Mr. Skolovsky has fine rhythm , to boot .</s>

<s>his tone is the weakest part of his equipment ;
it tends to be hard and colorless .</s>

<s>a school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs .</s>

<s>it is , after all , a non-romantic work ( even with the big , juicy melody of the second movement ) ;
and the composer himself was called the age of steel pianist .</s>

<s>but granted all this , one still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than Mr. Skolovsky supplied .</s>

<s>taken as a whole , though , it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra .</s>

<s>Mr. Skolovsky fully deserved the warm reception he received .</s>

<s>a new work on the program was Nikolai Lopatnikoff's Festival Overture , receiving its first New York hearing .</s>

<s>this was composed last year as a salute to the automobile industry .</s>

<s>it is not program music , though .</s>

<s>it runs a little more than ten minutes , is workmanlike , busy , methodical and featureless .</s>

<s>La Gioconda , like it or not , is a singer's opera .</s>

<s>and so , of course , it is a fan's opera as well .</s>

<s>snow or no , the fans were present in force at the Metropolitan Opera last night for a performance of the Ponchielli work .</s>

<s>so the plot creaks , the sets are decaying , the costumes are pre-historic , the orchestra was sloppy and not very well connected with what the singers were doing .</s>

<s>after all , the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed , with no less than six leading parts .</s>

<s>one of those parts is that of evil , evil Barnaba , the spy .</s>

<s>his wicked deeds were carried on by Anselmo Colzani , who was taking the part for the first time with the company .</s>

<s>he has the temperament and the stage presence for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone .</s>

<s>what was lacking was a real sense of phrase , the kind of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is , after all , a very oily character .</s>

<s>Regina Resnik as Laura and Cesare Siepi as Alvise also were new to the cast , but only with respect to this season ;
they have both sung these parts here before .</s>

<s>Laura is a good role for Miss Resnik , and she gave it force , dramatic color and passion .</s>

<s>Mr. Siepi was , as always , a consummate actor ;
with a few telling strokes he characterized Alvise magnificently .</s>

<s>part of this characterization was , of course , accomplished with the vocal chords .</s>

<s>his singing was strong and musical ;
unfortunately his voice was out of focus and often spread in quality .</s>

<s>Eileen Farrell in the title role , Mignon Dunn as La Cieca and Richard Tucker as Enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season , and all contributed to a vigorous performance .</s>

<s>if only they and Fausto Cleva in the pit had got together a bit more .</s>

<s>melodious birds sing madrigals saith the poet and no better description of the madrigaling of the Deller Consort could be imagined .</s>

<s>their Vanguard album Madrigal Masterpieces ( BG 609 ;
stereo J 5031 ) is a good sample of the special , elegant art of English madrigal singing .</s>

<s>it also makes a fine introduction to the international art form with good examples of Italian and English madrigals plus several French chansons .</s>

<s>the English have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else .</s>

<s>the original impulses came to England late ( in the sixteenth century ) and continue strong long after everyone else had gone on to the baroque basso continuo , sonatas , operas and the like .</s>

<s>even after Elizabethan traditions were weakened by the Cromwellian interregnum , the practice of singing together -- choruses , catches and glees -- always flourished .</s>

<s>the English never again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way , say , the opera in Italy blotted out the Italian madrigal .</s>

<s>early interest
latter-day interest in Elizabethan singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in England , much ahead of similar revivals in other countries .</s>

<s>as a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more often performed than the English madrigal .</s>

<s>naturally , Mr. Deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their countrymen : William Byrd , Thomas Morley and Thomas Tomkins .</s>

<s>there is an almost instrumental quality to their singing , with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture .</s>

<s>both techniques give the music purity and clarity .</s>

<s>Claude Jannequin's vocal description of a battle ( the French equivalents of tarantara , rum-tum-tum , and boom-boom-boom are very picturesque ) is lots of fun , and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other chansons by Jannequin and Lassus .</s>

<s>only with the more sensual , intense and baroque expressions of Marenzio , Monteverdi and Gesualdo does the singing seem a little superficial .</s>

<s>nevertheless , the musicality , accuracy and infectious charm of these performances , excellently reproduced , make it an attractive look-see at the period .</s>

<s>the works are presented chronologically .</s>

<s>texts and translations are provided .</s>

<s>elegance and color
the elements of elegance and color in Jannequin are strong French characteristics .</s>

<s>baroque instrumental music in Italy and Germany tends to be strong , lively , intense , controlled and quite abstract .</s>

<s>in France , it remained always more picturesque , more dancelike , more full of flavor .</s>

<s>Couperin and Rameau gave titles to nearly everything they wrote , not in the later sense of program music but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close , clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance .</s>

<s>both composers turn up on new imports from France .</s>

<s>BAM is the unlikely name of a French recording company whose full label is Editions De La boite A Musique .</s>

<s>they specialize in out-of-the-way items and old French music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention .</s>

<s>Sonates et Concerts Royaux of Couperin Le Grand occupy two disks ( J and J and reveal the impeccable taste and workmanship of this master -- delicate , flexible and gemlike .</s>

<s>the Concerts -- nos.</s>

<s>2 , 6 , 9 , 10 and 14 are represented -- are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the Italian sense .</s>

<s>the sonatas , La Francaise , La Sultane , L'Astree and L'Imperiale , are often more elaborately worked out and , in fact , show a strong Italian influence .</s>

<s>Couperin also turns up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk called Musique Francaise Du 18e Siecle ( BAM 060 ) .</s>

<s>Jean-Marie LeClair still is remembered a bit , but Bodin De Beismortier , Corrette and Mondonville are hardly household words .</s>

<s>what is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of French music that was moving toward the rococo .</s>

<s>the Couperin La Steinkerque , with its battle music , brevity , wit and refined simplicity , already shakes off Corelli and points towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era .</s>

<s>if Couperin shows the fashionable trend , the others do so all the more .</s>

<s>all these records have close , attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic .</s>

<s>Rameau's Six Concerts En Sextuor , recorded by L'orchestre De Chambre Pierre Menet ( BAM 046 ) , turn out to be harpsichord pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself .</s>

<s>the strange , delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious .</s>

<s>Maitres Allemands Des 17e et 18e Siecles contains music by Pachelbel , Buxtehude , Rosenmueller and Telemann , well performed by the Ensemble Instrumental Sylvie Spycket ( BAM 035 ) .</s>

<s>rococo music -- a lot of it -- was played in Carnegie Recital Hall on Saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored this season by a new organization known as Globe Concert Arts .</s>

<s>works by J. C. Bach , Anton Craft , Joseph Haydn , Giuseppe Sammartini , Comenico Dragonetti and J. G. Janitsch were performed by seven instrumentalists including Anabel Brieff , flutist , Josef Marx , oboist , and Robert Conant , pianist and harpsichordist .</s>

<s>since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all , it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from Beethoven to Boulez .</s>

<s>thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on Saturday night .</s>

<s>each might find a useful place in a varied musical program , but taken together they grew quite tiresome .</s>

<s>the performances were variable , those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying , some by soloists proving rather trying .</s>

<s>Ellie Mao , soprano , and Frederick Fuller , baritone , presented a program of folksongs entitled East Meets West in Carnegie Recital Hall last night .</s>

<s>they were accompanied by Anna Mi Lee , pianist .</s>

<s>selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos and duets in a broad range of languages .</s>

<s>songs from China and Japan were reserved exclusively for Miss Mao , who is a native of China , and those of the British Isles were sung by Mr. Fuller , who is English by birth .</s>

<s>this was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles .</s>

<s>on the contrary , Miss Mao and Mr. Fuller chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such as Mendelssohn , Dvorak , Canteloube , Copland and Britten .</s>

<s>there was , therefore , more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise .</s>

<s>the performances were assured , communicative and pleasingly informal .</s>

<s>what was omitted from A Neglected Education were those essentials known as the facts of life .</s>

<s>Chabrier's little one-act operetta , presented yesterday afternoon at Town Hall , is a fragile , precious little piece , very French , not without wit and charm .</s>

<s>the poor uneducated newlywed , a certain Gontran De Boismassif , has his problems in getting the necessary information .</s>

<s>the humor of the situation can be imagined .</s>

<s>it all takes place in the eighteenth century .</s>

<s>what a silly , artificial way of life , Chabrier and his librettists chuckle .</s>

<s>but they wish they could bring it back .</s>

<s>Chabrier's delightful music stands just at the point where the classical , rationalist tradition , ( handed down to Chabrier largely in the form of operetta and salon music ) becomes virtually neo-classicism .</s>

<s>the musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or mawkish .</s>

<s>the simple , clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes .</s>

<s>Arlene Saunders was charming as poor Gontran .</s>

<s>yes , Arlene is her name ;
the work uses the old eighteenth-century tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano .</s>

<s>Benita Valente was delightful as the young wife and John Parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring .</s>

<s>the work was presented as the final event in the Town Hall Festival of Music .</s>

<s>it was paired with a Darius Milhaud opera , The Poor Sailor , set to a libretto by Jean Cocteau , a kind of Grand Guignol by the sea , a sailor returns , unrecognized , and gets done in by his wife .</s>

<s>with the exception of a few spots , Milhaud's music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties , odd harmonies , and lumbering , satiric orchestration .</s>

<s>had a funny experience at Newport yesterday afternoon .</s>

<s>sat there and as a woman sang , she kept getting thinner and thinner , right before my eyes , and the eyes of some 5,500 other people .</s>

<s>I make this observation about the lady , Miss Judy Garland , because she brought up the subject herself in telling a story about a British female reporter who flattered her terribly in London recently and then wrote in the paper the next day : Judy Garland has arrived in London .</s>

<s>she's not chubby .</s>

<s>she's not plump .</s>

<s>she's fat .</s>

<s>but who cares , when the lady sings ?</s>

<s>certainly not the largest afternoon audience Newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet .</s>

<s>they applauded every number , not only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme -- sometimes at the first chord .</s>

<s>and Judy sang the lovely old familiar things which seemed , at times , a blessed relief from the way-out compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings .</s>

<s>things like When You're Smiling , Almost Like Being In Love , Do It Again , Born To Wander , Alone Together , Who Cares ?</s>

<s>, Puttin' On The Ritz , How Long Has This Been Going On ?</s>

<s>and her own personal songs like The Man That Got Away , and the inevitable Over The Rainbow .</s>

<s>Miss Garland is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen .</s>

<s>at the start of her program there were evidences of pique .</s>

<s>she had held to the letter of her contract and didn't come onto the stage until well after 4 p.m. , the appointed hour , although the Music at Newport people had tried to get the program underway at 3 .</s>

<s>then there was a bad delay in getting Mort Lindsey's 30-piece orchestra wedged into its chairs .</s>

<s>along about 4:30 , just when it was getting to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side , Judy came on singing , in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flapped in the wind .</s>

<s>her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing .</s>

<s>in her first song she waved away one encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm.</s>

<s>lenses and shoot at extreme range .</s>

<s>there also came a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during a quiet moment near the conclusion of Do It Again , and she made the tart observation that I never saw so much moving about in an audience .</s>

<s>but it didn't take Judy Garland , showman , long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at Newport and that you have to learn to live with it .</s>

<s>before her chore was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music , trundling microphones about the stage , helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere .</s>

<s>and time after time she really belted out her songs .</s>

<s>sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged -- which was the way I felt about her Come Rain or Come Shine -- and sometimes they were just plain magnificent , like her shatteringly beautiful Beautiful Weather .</s>

<s>to her partisan audience , such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than a critic striving to hold his franchise ;
they just sat back on their haunches and cried for more , as though they could never get enough .</s>

<s>they were rewarded with splendid , exciting , singing .</s>

<s>her Rockabye Your Baby was as good as it can be done , and her really personal songs , like The Man That Got Away were deeply moving .</s>

<s>the audience wouldn't let her leave until it had heard Over The Rainbow -- although the fellow that kept crying for Get Happy had to go home unhappy , about that item anyway .</s>

<s>she was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with its cheers and applause and flowers .</s>

<s>all went home happy except the Newport police , who feared that the throng departing at 6:35 might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh , and those deprived of their happy hour at the cocktail bar .</s>

<s>in Newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies .</s>

<s>this was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the evening -- flashes in the distance , but no storm .</s>

<s>several times it came near breaking , and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder from Jerry Mulligan's big band , which is about as fine an aggregation as has come along in the jazz business since John Hammond found Count Basie working in a Kansas City trap .</s>

<s>Mulligan's band has been infected with his solid sense of swing , and what it does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the big concert aggregations .</s>

<s>but what is equally impressive is the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and Mulligan's baritone sax in a fragile ballad like Bob Brookmeyer's arrangement of Django's Castle .</s>

<s>for subtle swinging rhythms , I could admire intensely Mulligan's version of Weep , and the fireworks went on display in 18 Carrots For Robert , a sax tribute to Johnny Hodges .</s>

<s>there was considerable contrast between this Mulligan performance and that of Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers , who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group .</s>

<s>unfortunately , Blakey doesn't choose to work much of the time in this vein .</s>

<s>he prefers to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like .</s>

<s>what we did get , however , was impressive .</s>

<s>a few drops of rain just before midnight , when Sarah Vaughan was in the midst of her first number , scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly , but at this hour and with Sarah on the stand , most of the listeners didn't care whether they got wet .</s>

<s>Miss Vaughan was back in top form , somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time -- like a fine wine .</s>

<s>after the spate of female vocalists we have been having , all of whom took Sarah as a point of departure and then tried to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat , it seemed that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than ever .</s>

<s>Jazz Three open program
the evening program was opened by the Jazz Three , a Newport group consisting of Steve Budieshein on bass , Jack Warner , drums , and Don Cook , piano .</s>

<s>this was a continuation of a good idea which was first tried out Saturday night when the Eddie Stack group , also local talent , went on first .</s>

<s>putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple purpose : it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in this unenviable spot , when the audience is cold , restless , and in flux ;
it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear , and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous Newport audience .</s>

<s>the Jazz Three displayed their sound musicianship , not only in their own chosen set , but as the emergency accompanists for Al Minns & Leon James , the superb jazz dancers who have now been Newport performers for three successive years , gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program .</s>

<s>Julie Wilson sings
Julie Wilson , a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists , sang a set , a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old oldies as Hard-Hearted Hannah , The Vamp Of Savannah , and the delightful Sunday .</s>

<s>she frosted the cake with the always reliable Bill Bailey .</s>

<s>from this taste of the 1920s , we leaped way out to Stan Getz's private brand of progressive jazz , which did lovely , subtle things for Baubles , Bangles And Beads , and a couple of ballards .</s>

<s>Getz is a difficult musician to categorize .</s>

<s>he plays his sax principally for beauty of tone , rather than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations , and he has a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising is over .</s>

<s>in this he is sticking with tradition , however far removed from it he may seem to be .</s>

<s>Shearing takes over
George Shearing took over with his well disciplined group , a sextet consisting of vibes , guitar , bass , drums , Shearing's piano and a bongo drummer .</s>

<s>he met with enthusiastic audience approval , especially when he swung from jazz to Latin American things like the Mambo .</s>

<s>Shearing , himself , seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent Newport appearances .</s>

<s>a very casual , pleasant program -- one of those easy-going things that make Newport's afternoon programs such a relaxing delight -- was held again under sunny skies , hot sun , and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came to Newport to hear music rather than go to the beach .</s>

<s>divided almost equally into two parts , it consisted of The Evolution Of The Blues , narrated by Jon Hendricks , who had presented it last year at the Monterey , Calif. , Jazz Festival , and an hour-long session of Maynard Ferguson and his orchestra , a blasting big band .</s>

<s>Hendricks' story was designed for children and he had a small audience of small children right on stage with him .</s>

<s>tracing the blues from its African roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the West Indies , he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the Negro churches .</s>

<s>surprise addition
to help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he had Big Miller , as a preacher-singer and Hannah Dean , Gospel-singer , while Oscar Brown Jr. , an extremely talented young man , did a slave auctioneer's call , a field-hands' work song , and a beautifully sung Negro lullaby , Brown Baby , which was one of the truly moving moments of the festival .</s>

<s>one of those delightful surprise additions , which so frequently occur in jazz programs , was an excellent stint at the drums by the great Joe Jones , drumming to Old Man River , which seems to have been elected the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this year's concerts .</s>

<s>demonstrating the primitive African rhythmic backgrounds of the Blues was Michael Babatunde Olatunji , who plays such native drums as the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest .</s>

<s>he has been on previous Newport programs and was one of the sensations of last year's afternoon concerts .</s>

<s>Hendricks had Billy Mitchell , tenor sax ;
Pony Poindexter , alto sax ;
Jimmy Witherspoon , Blues singer ( and a good one ) , and the Ike Isaacs Trio , which has done such wonderful work for two afternoons now , helping him with the musical examples .</s>

<s>it all went very well .</s>

<s>pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in Schubert's Sonatas .</s>

<s>music lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent example , played for J by Emil Gilels .</s>

<s>he has chosen Sonata Op.</s>

<s>53 in J .</s>

<s>the playing takes both sides of the disc .</s>

<s>perhaps one of the reasons these Sonatas are not programmed more often is their great length .</s>

<s>rhythmic interest , melodic beauty and the expansiveness of the writing are all qualities which hold one's attention with the Gilels playing .</s>

<s>his technique is ample and his musical ideas are projected beautifully .</s>

<s>the male chorus of the Robert Shaw Chorale sings Sea Shanties in fine style .</s>

<s>the group is superbly trained .</s>

<s>what a discussion can ensue when the title of this type of song is in question .</s>

<s>do you say chantey , as if the word were derived from the French word chanter , to sing , or do you say shanty and think of a roughly built cabin , which derives its name from the French-Canadian use of the word chantier , with one of its meanings given as a boat-yard ?</s>

<s>I say chantey .</s>

<s>either way , the Robert Shaw chorus sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame spelled out in terms of agreeable listening .</s>

<s>if your favorite song is not here it must be an unfamiliar one .</s>

<s>the London label offers an operatic recital by Ettore Bastianini , a baritone whose fame is international .</s>

<s>Murray Louis and his dance company appeared at the Henry Street Playhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work , Signal , and the repetition of an earlier one , Journal .</s>

<s>Signal is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by Alwin Nikolais .</s>

<s>its abstract decor is by John Hultberg .</s>

<s>program note reads as follows : take hands ;
this urgent visage beckons us .</s>

<s>here , as in Journal , Mr. Louis has given himself the lion's share of the dancing , and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements .</s>

<s>indeed , both Journal and Signal qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics .</s>

<s>but chains of movements are not necessarily communicative , and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing .</s>

<s>one frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect , there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development .</s>

<s>it may be , of course , that Mr. Louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation .</s>

<s>but it may be , also , that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time .</s>

<s>one thing is certain , however , and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents , phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be .</s>

<s>an American journey
a brisk , satirical spoof of contemporary American mores entitled An American Journey was given its first New York performance at Hunter College Playhouse last night by the Helen Tamiris-Daniel Nagrin Dance Company .</s>

<s>choreographed by Mr. Nagrin , the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first New York showing of Miss Tamiris' Once Upon A Time as well as her Women's Song and Mr. Nagrin's Indeterminate Figure .</s>

<s>Eugene Lester assembled a witty and explicit score for An American Journey , and Malcolm McCormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes .</s>

<s>Mr. Nagrin has described four places , each with its scenery and people , added two diversions , and concluded with A Toccata for the Young , a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rock'n'roll dancing .</s>

<s>the places could be anywhere , the idiosyncrasies and foibles observed there could be anybody's , and the laugh is on us all .</s>

<s>but we need not mind too much , because Mr. Nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all the way .</s>

<s>Miss Tamiris' Once Upon A Time is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three figures that bother them somehow .</s>

<s>unfortunately , the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures failed to make them any more so .</s>

<s>nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at any time .</s>

<s>the music here , Russell Smith's Tetrameron , sounded good .</s>

<s>all the performances of the evening were smooth and assured , and the sizable company , with Mr. Nagrin and Marion Scott as its leading dancers , seemed to be fine shape .</s>

<s>the Symphony Of The Air , greatly assisted by Van Cliburn , last night got its seven-concert Beethoven cycle at Carnegie Hall off to a good start .</s>

<s>at the same time the orchestra announced that next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at Carnegie , and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs , repeating each of them in five different communities .</s>

<s>this news , announced by Jerome Toobin , the orchestra's administrative director , brought applause from the 2,800 persons who filled the hall .</s>

<s>they showed they were glad that Carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to Lincoln Center of the New York Philharmonic , the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Boston Symphony .</s>

<s>this season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription concerts for the Orchestral Society of Westchester in the County Center in White Plains .</s>

<s>the details of the suburban concerts next season , and the centers in which they will be given , will be announced later , Mr. Toobin said .</s>

<s>the concertos that Van Cliburn has been associated with in New York since his triumphant return from Russia in 1958 have been the Tchaikovsky , the Rachmaninoff Third , and the Prokofieff Third .</s>

<s>it was pleasant last night , therefore , to hear him do something else : a concerto he has recently recorded , The Emperor .</s>

<s>the young Texas pianist can make great chords ring out as well as anyone , so last night the massive sonorities of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him .</s>

<s>but they were not what distinguished his performance .</s>

<s>the elements that did were the introspective slow movement , the beautiful transition to the third movement , and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final Rondo .</s>

<s>Mr. Cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a Chopin Nocturne .</s>

<s>Alfred Wallenstein , the conductor , sensitive accompanist that he is , picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of brooding , poetic mystery .</s>

<s>the collaboration was remarkable , as it was in both the other movements , too .</s>

<s>Mr. Wallenstein , who will lead all of the concerts in the cycle , also conducted the Leonore Overture No.</s>

<s>3 and the Fourth Symphony .</s>

<s>the orchestra was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively .</s>

<s>and although there was plenty of vigor in the performance , the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical , yet full of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of Beethoven .</s>

<s>Igor Oistrakh will be the next soloist on Feb. 4 .</s>

<s>there are times when one suspects that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach Broadway may really be better than many of those that are left in .</s>

<s>today , in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show , it is understandable that a song , no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms , is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it .</s>

<s>in the more casually constructed musicals of the Nineteen Twenties and Nineteen Thirties there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit .</s>

<s>yet there is the classic case of the Gershwins' The Man I Love .</s>

<s>deemed too static when it was first heard in Lady Be Good in Philadelphia in 1924 , it was dropped from the score .</s>

<s>it was heard again in Philadelphia in 1927 in the first version of Strike Up The Band and again abandoned shortly before the entire show was given up .</s>

<s>it finally reached Broadway in the second and successful version of Strike Up The Band in 1929 .</s>

<s>( still another song in Strike Up The Band -- I've Got A Crush On You -- was retrieved from a 1928 failure , Treasure Girl .
)</s>

<s>second chance
like the Gershwins , Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart were loath to let a good song get away from them .</s>

<s>if one of Mr. Rodgers' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in Boston or the obscurity of a Broadway failure , Mr. Hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show .</s>

<s>several of these double entries have been collected by Ben Bagley and Michael McWhinney , along with Rodgers and Hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to New York and others that reached Broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard Rodgers and Hart repertory , in a delightfully refreshing album , Rodgers And Hart Revisited ( Spruce Records , 505 Fifth Avenue , New York ) .</s>

<s>among the particular gems in this collection is the impudent opening song of The Garrick Gaieties , an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from Rodgers and Hart in the years that followed ;
Dorothy Loudon's raucous listing of the attractions At The Roxy Music Hall from I Married An Angel ;
and the incisive style with which Charlotte Rae delivers the top-drawer Hart lyrics of I Blush , a song that was cut from A Connecticut Yankee .</s>

<s>altogether fifteen virtually unknown Rodgers and Hart songs are sung by a quintet of able vocalists .</s>

<s>Norman Paris has provided them with extremely effective orchestral accompaniment .</s>

<s>turning to the current musical season on Broadway , the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals , How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying , has been transferred to an original cast album ( R. C. A. Victor 1066 ;
stereo J 1066 ) that has some entertaining moments , although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited by the show might lead one to expect .</s>

<s>Robert Morse , singing with comically plaintive earnestness , carries most of the burden and is responsible for the high spots in Frank Loesser's score .</s>

<s>Rudy Vallee , who shares star billing with Mr. Morse , makes only two appearances .</s>

<s>he shares with Mr. Morse a parody of the college anthems he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by Virginia Martin , a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice .</s>

<s>in general , Mr. Loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist than he has as composer .</s>

<s>like Mr. Loesser , Jerry Herman is both composer and lyriist for Milk And Honey ( R. C. A. Victor J 1065 ;
stereo J 1065 ) , but in this case it is the music that stands above the lyrics .</s>

<s>for this story of an American couple who meet and fall in love in Israel , Mr. Herman has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles .</s>

<s>resourceful voices
there are the full-bodied , resourceful voices of Robert Weede , Mimi Benzell and Tommy Rall to make the most of Mr. Herman's lilting melodies and , for an occasional change of pace , the bright humor of Molly Picon .</s>

<s>Mr. Herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from Israel and the standard American ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both idioms .</s>

<s>not content to create only the music and lyrics , Noel Coward also wrote the book and directed Sail Away ( Capitol J 1643 ;
stereo J 1643 ) , a saga of life on a cruise ship that is not apt to be included among Mr. Coward's more memorable works .</s>

<s>the melodies flow along pleasantly , as Mr. Coward's songs usually do , but his lyrics have a tired , cut-to-a-familiar-pattern quality .</s>

<s>Elaine Stritch , who sings with a persuasively warm huskiness , belts some life into most of her songs , but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm as Mr. Coward's songs .</s>

<s>with three fine Russian films in recent months on World War 2 -- The House I Live In , The Cranes Are Flying and Ballad Of A Soldier -- we had every right to expect a real Soviet block-buster in The Day The War Ended .</s>

<s>it simply isn't , not by a long shot .</s>

<s>the Artkino presentation , with English titles , opened on Saturday at the Cameo Theatre .</s>

<s>make no mistake , this Gorky Studio drama is a respectable import -- aptly grave , carefully written , performed and directed .</s>

<s>in describing the initial Allied occupation of a middle-sized German city , the picture has color , pictorial pull and genuinely moving moments .</s>

<s>told strictly from the viewpoint of the Russian conquerors , the film compassionately peers over the shoulders of a smitten Soviet couple , at both sides of the conflict's aftermath .</s>

<s>unfortunately , the whole picture hinges on this romance , at the expense of everything else .</s>

<s>tenderly and rather tediously , the camera rivets on the abrupt , deep love of a pretty nurse and a uniformed teacher , complicated by nothing more than a friend they don't want to hurt .</s>

<s>it's the old story , war or no war , and more than one viewer may recall Hollywood's Titanic , several seasons back , when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of a society dilettante .</s>

<s>not that the picture is superficial .</s>

<s>under Yakov Segal's direction , it begins stirringly , as crouching Soviet and Nazi troops silently scan each other , waiting for the first surrender gesture .</s>

<s>one high-up camera shot is magnificent , as the Germans straggle from a cathedral , dotting a huge , cobblestone square , and drop their weapons .</s>

<s>Ring Of Bright Water , by Gavin Maxwell

<s>211 pages .</s>

<s>Dutton .</s>

<s>$5 .</s>

<s>only once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience .</s>

<s>Ring Of Bright Water by Gavin Maxwell is just that -- a haunting , warmly personal chronicle of a man , an otter , and a remote cottage in the Scottish West Highlands .</s>

<s>he has married me with a ring of bright water , begins the Kathleen Raine poem from which Maxwell takes his title , and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys .</s>

<s>the place is Camusfearna , the site of a long-vanished sea-village opposite the isle of Skye .</s>

<s>it is a land of long fjords , few people , a single-lane road miles away -- and of wild stags , Greylag geese , wild swans , dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters .</s>

<s>how Maxwell recounts his first coming to Camusfearna , his furnishing the empty house with beach-drift , the subtle changes in season over ten years , is a moving experience .</s>

<s>just the evocations of time and place , of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost , would be enough .</s>

<s>but it isn't .</s>

<s>there is Mijbil , an otter who travelled with Maxwell -- and gave Maxwell's name to a new species -- from the Tigris marshes to his London flat .</s>

<s>it may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more engaging animal in all literature .</s>

<s>this is not only a compliment to Mijbil , of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book , but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened otter cub's journey by plane from Iraq to London , then by train ( where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap ) to Camusfearna , with affectionate detail .</s>

<s>Mij , as his owner was soon to learn , had strange , inexplicable habits .</s>

<s>he liked to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth .</s>

<s>he preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow .</s>

<s>systematically he would open and ransack drawers .</s>

<s>given a small ball or marbles , he would invent games and play by himself for hours .</s>

<s>with curiosity and elan , he explored every inch of glen , beach and burn , once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by Maxwell , who nearly lost his life in doing so .</s>

<s>a year and a day of this idyll is described for the reader , one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality is charted , but self-discovery as well .</s>

<s>in the solitude of Camusfearna there had been no loneliness .</s>

<s>to be quite alone where there are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating ;
it is as though some pressure had suddenly been lifted , allowing an intense awareness a sharpening of the senses .</s>

<s>now , with the increasing interdependence between himself and Mij came a knowledge of an obscure need , that of being trusted implicitly by some creature .</s>

<s>two other people in time shared Mijbil's love : it remained around us three that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable world of wave and water ;
we were his Trinity , and he behaved towards us with a mixture of trust and abuse , passion and irritation .</s>

<s>in turn each of us in our own way depended , as gods do , upon his worship .</s>

<s>yet the idyll ended .</s>

<s>the brief details of Mijbil's death lend depth to the story , give it an edge of ironic tragedy .</s>

<s>man , to whom Mij gave endless affection and fealty , was responsible in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract symbol of the savage in man .</s>

<s>but then , through a strange coincidence , Maxwell manages to acquire Idal , a female otter , and the fascinating story starts once more .</s>

<s>one is not sure who emerges as the main personality of this book -- Mijbil , with his rollicking ways , or Maxwell himself , poet , portrait painter , writer , journalist , traveller and zoologist , sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an unusual way of life , in a language at once lyrical and forceful , vivid and unabashed .</s>

<s>this reviewer read the book when it was first brought out in England with a sense of discovery and excitement .</s>

<s>now Gavin Maxwell's Ring Of Bright Water has widened to enchant the world .</s>

<s>New York -- the performances of the Comedie Francaise are the most important recent events in the New York theater .</s>

<s>they serve to contradict a popular notion that the Comedie merely repeats , as accurately as possible , the techniques of acting the classics that prevailed in the 17th century .</s>

<s>on the contrary , the old plays are continually being reinterpreted , and each new production of a classic has only a brief history at the Comedie .</s>

<s>of course , the well-received revivals last longer than the others , and that further reminds us that the Comedie is not insensitive to criticism .</s>

<s>the directors of the Comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the Broadway producers who , in two instances this season , closed their plays after one performance .</s>

<s>but they are aware of the world outside , they court public approval , they delight in full houses , and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic .</s>

<s>in France , novel approaches to the classic French plays are frequently attempted .</s>

<s>the government pays a subsidy for revival of the classics , and this policy attracts experimenters who sometimes put Moliere's characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results .</s>

<s>so far as I know , the Comedie has never put Moliere's people in the costumes of the 20th century , but they do reinterpret plays and characters .</s>

<s>last season , the Comedie's two principal experiments came to grief , and , in consequence , we can expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of Racine's Phedre and Moliere's School For Wives .</s>

<s>the new Phedre was done in 17th century setting , instead of ancient Greek ;
perhaps that is the Comedie's equivalent for thrusting this play's characters into our own time .</s>

<s>the speaking of the lines seemed excessively slow and stately , possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of 17th century elegance .</s>

<s>a few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama , but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent .</s>

<s>the new School For Wives was interpreted according to a principle that is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy -- the idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character .</s>

<s>among the Moliere specialists of some years ago , Louis Jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns , while Fernand Ledoux , often performing at the Comedie , made them more gross than Moliere may have intended .</s>

<s>apparently , Jouvet and Ledoux attempted just these dissimilar approaches in the role of Arnolphe in The School For Wives .</s>

<s>I say apparently although I saw Jouvet as Arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death ;
by that time , he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy .</s>

<s>Arnolphe , it will be recalled , is a man of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be .</s>

<s>the part can lend itself to serious treatment ;
one influential French critic remarked : pity for Arnolphe comes with age .</s>

<s>accordingly , at the Comedie last year , Jean Meyer played a sympathetic Arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy .</s>

<s>but the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly .</s>

<s>wisely , the Comedie has brought Moliere's Tartuffe on its tour and has left The School For Wives at home .</s>

<s>Tartuffe is the religious hypocrite who courts his benefactor's wife .</s>

<s>Jouvet played him as a sincere zealot , and Ledoux , at the Comedie , made him a gross buffoon , or so the historians tell us .</s>

<s>Louis Seigner , who formerly played the deluded benefactor opposite Ledoux , is the Tartuffe of the present production , which he himself directed .</s>

<s>his Tartuffe observes the golden mean .</s>

<s>his red face , his coarse gestures , and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality .</s>

<s>but his heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely perfunctory ;
of course , they do not reflect sincerity , but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his pious impersonation .</s>

<s>occasionally , Seigner draws some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another .</s>

<s>the whole role , by the way , is a considerable transformation for anyone who has seen Seigner in his other parts .</s>

<s>his normal specialty is playing the good-natured old man , frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly .</s>

<s>here , he is , quite persuasively , the very embodiment of meanness and slyness .</s>

<s>Seigner is the dean of the company , the oldest actor in point of continuous service .</s>

<s>in that function , he helps to rebut another legend about the Comedie .</s>

<s>we are often told that the Comedie has , unfortunately , life-contracts with old actors who are both mediocre and lazy , drawing their pay without much acting but probably doing real service to the Comedie by staying off the stage .</s>

<s>Seigner , however , is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the company ;
among his other parts are the leads in The Bourgeois Gentleman and The Imaginary Invalid .</s>

<s>in Moliere's farce , The Tricks Of Scapin , Robert Hirsch undertakes another of the great roles .</s>

<s>here some innovation is attempted .</s>

<s>to begin with , Scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master .</s>

<s>Hirsch's Scapin is healthy , cheerful , energetic , revelling in his physical agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he serves .</s>

<s>Hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities he has observed in the city toughs of the real world .</s>

<s>and surely his Scapin has a fresh directness , a no-nonsense quality that seems to make him his own master and nobody's servant .</s>

<s>Django Reinhardt , the ill-fated gypsy , was a true artist , one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and flow into many channels .</s>

<s>there is hardly a jazz guitarist in the business today who doesn't owe something to Django .</s>

<s>and Django owed much to Louis Armstrong .</s>

<s>he told once of how he switched his style of playing to jazz after listening to two old Armstrong records he bought in the Flea Market in Paris .</s>

<s>it was the first jazz he had heard .</s>

<s>Django , who was born Jean Baptiste Reinhardt in Belgium and who died in 1953 in France , was an extraordinary man .</s>

<s>most of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep with a cigarette .</s>

<s>and this was before he began to play his startlingly beautiful jazz .</s>

<s>you can catch up with him -- if you haven't already -- on J album .</s>

<s>Djangology , made up of tracks he recorded with Stephane Grappelly and the Quintet of the Hot Club of France .</s>

<s>this is a choice item and Grappely deserves mention too , of course .</s>

<s>he is one of the few men in history who plays jazz on a violin .</s>

<s>they play : Minor Swing , Honeysuckle Rose , Beyond The Sea , Bricktop , Heavy Artillery , Djangology , After You've Gone , Where Are You , My Love ?</s>

<s>I Saw Stars , Lover Man , Menilmontant and Swing 42 .</s>

<s>all this is great proceedings -- get the minutes .</s>

<s>Kid Ory , the trombonist chicken farmer , is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz .</s>

<s>he dates back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into New Orleans .</s>

<s>his horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years than he cares to remember .</s>

<s>Good Time Jazz has released a nice two-record album which he made .</s>

<s>he is starred against Alvin Alcorn , trumpet ;
Phil Gomez , clarinet ;
Cedric Haywood , piano ;
Julian Davidson , guitar ;
Wellman Braud , bass , and Minor Hall , drums .</s>

<s>the set contains High Society , Do What Ory Say , Down Home Rag , Careless Love , Jazz Me Blues , Weary Blues , Original Dixieland One-Step , Bourbon Street Parade , Panama , Toot , Toot , Tootsie , Oh Didn't He Ramble , Beale Street Blues , Maryland , My Maryland , 1919 Rag , Eh , La Bas , Mood Indigo , and Bugle Call Rag .</s>

<s>all this will serve to show off the Ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late to lay hands on the gems .</s>

<s>Mischa Elman shared last night's Lewisohn Stadium concert with three American composers .</s>

<s>his portion of the program -- and a big portion it was -- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century concertos for the violin : to wit , the Mendelssohn and the Tchaikovsky .</s>

<s>that is an evening of music-making that would faze many a younger man ;
Mr. Elman is 70 years old .</s>

<s>there were 8,000 persons at the Stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard Elman .</s>

<s>but , with all due respects and allowances , it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet , more mannered than musical .</s>

<s>the occasion was sentimental ;
so was the playing .</s>

<s>the American part of the evening consisted of Paul Creston's Dance Overture , William Schuman's Chester From New England Triptych and two works of Wallingford Riegger , Dance Rhythms , Op.</s>

<s>58 , and a Romanza For Strings , Op.</s>

<s>56A .</s>

<s>the Creston is purely a potboiler , with Spanish , English , French and American dances mixed into the stew .</s>

<s>the Riegger , with its Latin hesitation bounce , is just this side of the pale ;
like his sweet , attractive Romanza , it belongs to what the composer called his Non-Dissonant ( mostly ) category of works .</s>

<s>the Schuman Chester takes off from an old William Billings tune with rousing woodwind and brass effect .</s>

<s>all these -- potboilers or no -- provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively , colorful , unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors .</s>

<s>it was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change .</s>

<s>we have Alfredo Antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well as the lively performances of the Stadium Symphony .</s>

<s>a woman who undergoes artificial insemination against the wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of A Question Of Adultery , yesterday's new British import at the Apollo .</s>

<s>since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation that would often arise , the film's extensive discussion of the problem seems , at best , superfluous .</s>

<s>in its present artless , low-budget form , the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath .</s>

<s>with Julie London enacting the central role with husky-voiced sincerity , the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive .</s>

<s>the explanation offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile accident .</s>

<s>Anthony Steel , as the husband , is a jealous type who argues against her course and sues for divorce , labeling her action adulterous .</s>

<s>the actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction of Don Chaffey , as do Basil Sydney as his unsympathetic father and Anton Diffring as an innocent bystander .</s>

<s>after a protracted , hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language than for dramatic credibility , the jury , to no one's surprise , leaves the legal question unresolved .</s>

<s>when the husband drops the case and returns to his wife , both seem sorry they brought the matter up in the first place .</s>

<s>so was the audience .</s>

<s>London , July 4
for its final change of bill in its London season , the Leningrad State Kirov Ballet chose tonight to give one of those choreographic miscellanies known as a gala program at the Royal Opera House , Covent Garden .</s>

<s>no doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its presentations thus far , it too could give a circus if it pleased .</s>

<s>and please it did , in every sense of the word , for it had the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical of London audiences .</s>

<s>at the end of the program , indeed , there was a demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes , and nothing could stop it .</s>

<s>Alexandre Livshitz repeated a fantastic technical bit from the closing number , Taras Bulba , but even then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined not to go home at all .</s>

<s>only a plea from the house manager , John Collins , finally broke up the party .</s>

<s>but for all the manifest intention to show off , this was a circus with a difference , for instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level , it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company .</s>

<s>the Taras Bulba excerpt is a rousing version of Gogol's Ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by Bo Fenster to music of Soloviev-Sedoi .</s>

<s>it is danced by some thirty-five men and no women , and it contains everything in the books -- lusty comedy , gregarious cavorting , and tricks that only madmen or Russians would attempt to make the human body perform .</s>

<s>Yuri Soloviev , Oleg Sokolov , Alexei Zhitkov , Lev Sokolov , Yuri Korneyev and Mr. Livshitz were the chief soloists , but everybody on stage was magnificent .</s>

<s>at the other extreme in character was the half-hour excerpt from the Petipa-Minkus ballet Bayaderka , which opened the evening .</s>

<s>what a man this Petipa was ]
and why do we in the West know so few of his ballets ?</s>

<s>this scene is a white ballet in which a lovelorn hero searches for his departed love's spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily beautiful shadows who can all dance like nothing human -- which , of course , is altogether fitting .</s>

<s>the ensemble enters in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty , as well as loveliness , and adagio is the general medium of the piece .</s>

<s>its ballerina , Olga Moiseyeva , performs simple miracles of beauty , and Ludmilla Alexeyeva , Inna Korneyeva and Gabrielle Komleva make up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments .</s>

<s>Sergei Vikulov , as the lone male , meets the competition well with some brilliant hits , but the work is designed to belong to the ladies .</s>

<s>the middle section of the program was made up of short numbers , naturally enough of unequal merit , but all of them pretty good at that .</s>

<s>they consisted of a new arrangement of Nutcracker excerpts danced stunningly by Irina Kolpakova and Mr. Sokolev , with a large ensemble ;
a winning little Snow Maiden variation by the adorable Galina Kekisheva ;
two of those poetic adagios in Greek veils ( and superb esthetic acrobacy ) by Alla Osipenko and Igor Chernishev in one case and Inna Zubkovskaya and Yuri Kornevey in the other ;
an amusing character pas de cinq called Gossiping Women ;
a stirring Flames Of Paris pas de deux by Xenia Ter-Stepanova and Alexandre Pavlovsky , and a lovely version of Fokine's Le Cygne by Olga Moiseyeva , which had to be repeated .</s>

<s>Vadim Kalentiev was the conductor .</s>

<s>it was quite an evening ]
a year ago today , when the Democrats were fretting and frolicking in Los Angeles and John F. Kennedy was still only an able and ambitious Senator who yearned for the power and responsibility of the Presidency , Theodore H. White had already compiled masses of notes about the Presidential campaign of 1960 .</s>

<s>as the pace of the quadrennial American political festival accelerated , Mr. White took more notes .</s>

<s>he traveled alternately with Mr. Kennedy and with Richard M. Nixon .</s>

<s>he asked intimate questions and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates' in-groups .</s>

<s>he assembled quantities of facts about the nature of American politics in general , as well as about the day-to-day course of the closest Presidential election in American history .</s>

<s>those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about that election ;
how little we know of what there is to be known is made humiliatingly clear by Mr. White in The Making Of The President 1960 .</s>

<s>this is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one .</s>

<s>what might have been only warmed-over topical journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history .</s>

<s>Mr. White , who is only a competent novelist , is a brilliant reporter .</s>

<s>his zest for specific detail , his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere , his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book .</s>

<s>a lesson in politics
as a dramatic narrative The Making Of The President 1960 is continuously engrossing .</s>

<s>and as an introduction to American politics it is highly educational .</s>

<s>the author begins this volume with a close-up of Mr. Kennedy , his family and his entourage waiting for the returns .</s>

<s>he then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal Presidential hopefuls : five Democrats -- Senator Hubert H. Humphrey , Senator Stuart Symington , Senator Lyndon B. Johnson , Adlai E. Stevenson and Mr. Kennedy -- and two Republicans -- Governor Rockefeller and Mr. Nixon .</s>

<s>then , in chronological order , Mr. White covers the primary campaigns , the conventions and the Presidential campaign itself .</s>

<s>in the process he writes at length about many related matters : the importance of race , religion , local tradition , bosses , organizations , zealous volunteers and television .</s>

<s>Mr. White is bluntly frank in his personal opinions .</s>

<s>he frequently cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse's mouth , from numerous insiders and from Mr. Kennedy himself ;
but never from Mr. Nixon , who looked on reporters with suspicion and distrust .</s>

<s>rarely in American history has there been a political campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less , says Mr. White .</s>

<s>Mr. Nixon , he believes , has no particular political philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign .</s>

<s>although a skillful politician and a courageous and honest man , Mr. Nixon , Mr. White believes , ignored his own top-level planners , wasted time and effort in the wrong regions , missed opportunities through indecision and damaged his chances on television .</s>

<s>Mr. Nixon is a broody , moody man , given to long stretches of introspection ;
he trusts only himself and his wife .</s>

<s>he is a man of major talent -- but a man of solitary , uncertain impulses .</s>

<s>he was above all a friend seeker , almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked .</s>

<s>he wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them ;
the least inspiring candidate since Alfred M. Landon .</s>

<s>Mr. Kennedy , Mr. White believes , had mastered politics on so many different levels that no other American could match him .</s>

<s>calm , dignified , composed , superbly eloquent , Mr. Kennedy always knew everything about everybody .</s>

<s>he enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous volunteers .</s>

<s>every decision was made quickly on sound grounds .</s>

<s>efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance .</s>

<s>Mr. Kennedy did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters .</s>

<s>Mr. White admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a Democrat himself who expects Mr. Kennedy to be a fine President .</s>

<s>pressures portrayed
throughout The Making Of A President Mr. White shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on candidates , how decisions have constantly to be made , how fatigue and illness and nervous strain wear candidates down , how subordinates play key roles .</s>

<s>and he makes many interesting comments .</s>

<s>here are several : the root question in American politics is always : who's the man to see ?</s>

<s>to understand American politics is , simply , to know people , to know the relative weight of names -- who are heroes , who are straw men , who controls , who does not .</s>

<s>but to operate in American politics one must go a step further -- one must build a bridge to such names , establish a warmth , a personal connection .</s>

<s>in the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform nor any program advanced by either major American party has any purpose beyond expressing emotion .</s>

<s>all platforms are meaningless : the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party chooses to lead it .</s>

<s>nostalgia week at Lewisohn Stadium , which had begun with the appearance of the 70-year-old Mischa Elman on Tuesday night , continued last night as Lily Pons led the list of celebrities in an evening of French operatic excerpts .</s>

<s>Miss Pons is certainly not 70 -- no singer ever is -- and yet the rewards of the evening again lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in present accomplishments .</s>

<s>the better part of gallantry might be , perhaps , to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown , and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which she had chosen to sing .</s>

<s>no orchestra , however , could be expected to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as Miss Pons encountered last night .</s>

<s>in all fairness , there were flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear , flashes even of the old consummate vocalism .</s>

<s>one such moment came in the breathtaking way Miss Pons sang the cadenza to Meyerbeer's Shadow Song .</s>

<s>the years suddenly fell away at this point .</s>

<s>on the whole , however , one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time marches inexorably on .</s>

<s>sharing the program was the young French-Canadian tenor Richard Verreau , making his stadium debut on this occasion .</s>

<s>Mr. Verreau began shakily , with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed beyond middle volume .</s>

<s>later on this problem vanished , and the Flower Song from Bizet's Carmen was beautifully and intelligently projected .</s>

<s>radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener .</s>

<s>lower costs and a larger number of stations are the key factors making such specialization possible .</s>

<s>the mushrooming of J outlets , offering concerts ( both jazz and classical ) , lectures , and other special events , is a phenomenon which has had a fair amount of publicity .</s>

<s>not so well known is the growth of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at Negro listeners -- an audience which , in the United States , comprises some 19,000,000 people with $20,000,000,000 to spend each year .</s>

<s>of course , the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching .</s>

<s>he even buys a lot of the products he sees advertised -- despite the fact that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials .</s>

<s>but the growing number of Negro-appeal radio stations , plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers , give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects .</s>

<s>it is estimated that more than 600 stations ( of a total of 3,400 ) do a significant amount of programing for the Negro .</s>

<s>at least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this audience in about half of the 50 states .</s>

<s>these and other figures and comments have been reported in a special supplement of Sponsor magazine , a trade publication for radio and J advertisers .</s>

<s>for 10 years Sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics of the Negro market and of successful techniques for reaching this market through radio .</s>

<s>in the past 10 years , Sponsor observes , these trends have become apparent : Negro population in the U.S. has increased 25 per cent while the white population was growing by 18 per cent .</s>

<s>the forgotten 15 million -- as Sponsor tagged the Negro market in its first survey -- has become a better-remembered 19 million .</s>

<s>advertisers are changing their attitudes , both as to the significance of this market and the ways of speaking to it .</s>

<s>stations programing to Negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational , economic , and cultural levels .</s>

<s>futhermore , the station which wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement projects , not simply serve on the air .</s>

<s>in the last decade the number of Negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15 per cent , and the number of Negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per cent , according to a research man quoted by Sponsor .</s>

<s>a year ago the Negro Radio Association was formed to spur research which the 30-odd member stations are sure will bring in more business .</s>

<s>the 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population growth .</s>

<s>it also brought home proof of something a casual observer might have missed : that more than half of the U.S. Negroes live outside the southeastern states .</s>

<s>also , the state with the largest number of Negroes is New York -- not in the South at all .</s>

<s>in New York City , J boasts more community service programs than any other Negro station and one of the largest Negro news staffs in America .</s>

<s>and J colorful mobile unit , cruising predominately Negro neighborhoods , is a frequent reminder of that station's round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests .</s>

<s>recently , J won praise for its expose of particular cases of employment agency deceit .</s>

<s>a half-dozen other stations in the New York area also bid for attention of the city's Negro population , up about 50 per cent in the past decade .</s>

<s>in all big cities outside the South , and even in small towns within the South , radio stations can be found beaming some or all of their programs at Negro listeners .</s>

<s>the Keystone Broadcasting System's Negro network includes 360 affiliated stations , whose signals reach more than half the total U.S. Negro population .</s>

<s>one question which inevitably crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the Negro is moving into a fully integrated status .</s>

<s>whatever the long-range impact of integration , the owners of Negro-appeal radio stations these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal .</s>

<s>advertisers have discovered the tendency of Negroes to shop for brand names they have heard on stations catering to their special interests .</s>

<s>and many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a Negro disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words , working only from a fact sheet .</s>

<s>what sets Negro-appeal programing apart from other radio shows ?</s>

<s>Sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular Negro bands and singers ;
rhythm-and-blues mood music ;
race music , folk songs and melodies , and gospel programs .</s>

<s>furthermore , news and special presentations inform the listener about groups , projects , and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station .</s>

<s>advertising copy frequently takes into account matters of special Negro concern .</s>

<s>Sponsor quotes John McLendon of the McLendon-Ebony station group as saying that the Southern Negro is becoming conscious of quality and does not wish to be associated with radio which is any way degrading to his race ;
he tends to shy away from the hooting and hollering personalities that originally made Negro radio programs famous .</s>

<s>the sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently summed up in this quotation of J. Walter Carroll of J , San Francisco : Negro-appeal radio is more important to the Negro today , because it provides a direct and powerful mirror in which the Negro can hear and see his ambitions , achievements and desires .</s>

<s>it will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the Negro , seeking to become urbanized , as he tries to make adjustment to the urban life .</s>

<s>Negro radio is vitally necessary during the process of assimilation .</s>

<s>presentation of The Life And Times Of John Sloan in the Delaware Art Center here suggests a current nostalgia for human values in art .</s>

<s>staged by way of announcing the gift of a large and intimate Sloan collection by the artist's widow , Helen Farr Sloan , to the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts , the exhibition presents a survey of Sloan's work .</s>

<s>from early family portraits , painted before he entered the schools of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts , the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed in his last year ( 1951 ) and still part of his estate .</s>

<s>few artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they lived .</s>

<s>few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness .</s>

<s>the paintings , drawings , prints , and illustrations all reflect the manners , costumes , and mores of America in the first half of the present century .</s>

<s>obviously Sloan's early years were influenced by his close friend Robert Henri .</s>

<s>as early as 1928 , however , the Sloan style began to change .</s>

<s>the dark pigments of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette .</s>

<s>the solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of American genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes .</s>

<s>the exhibition presents all phases of Sloan's many-sided art .</s>

<s>in addition to the paintings are drawings , prints , and illustrations .</s>

<s>Sloan created such works for newspaper supplements before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the streets of New York , thereby building for America an incomparable city survey from paintings of McSorley's Saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs .</s>

<s>one of the most appealing of the rooftop canvases is Sun And Wind On The Roof , with a woman and child bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds .</s>

<s>although there are landscapes in the show ( one of the strongest is a vista of Gloucester Harbor in 1915 ) , the human element was the compelling factor in Sloan's art .</s>

<s>significant are such canvases as Bleeker Street , Saturday Night , with its typically American crowd ( Sloan never went abroad ) ;
the multifigure Traveling Carnival , in which action is vivified by lighting ;
or Carmine Theater , 1912 , the only canvas with an ash can ( and foraging dog ) , although Sloan was a member of the famous Eight , and of the so-called Ash-Can School , a term he resented .</s>

<s>not all the paintings , however , are of cities .</s>

<s>the exhibition touches briefly on his sojourn in the Southwest ( Koshare in the Dust , a vigorous Indian dance , and landscapes suggest the influence of western color on his palette ) .</s>

<s>the fact that Sloan was an extrovert , concerned primarily with what he saw , adds greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle .</s>

<s>there are 151 items in the Wilmington show , including one painting by each member of the Eight , as well as work by Sloan's friends and students .</s>

<s>supplementing the actual art are memorabilia -- correspondence , diaries , books from the artist's library , etc.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>all belong to the collection being given to Wilmington over a period of years by Mrs. Sloan , who has cherished such revelatory items ever since she first studied with Sloan at the Art Students League , New York , in the 1920's .</s>

<s>any musician playing Beethoven here , where Beethoven was born , is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care .</s>

<s>in a sense , he is offering Bonn what its famous son ( who left as a youth ) never did -- the sound of the composer's mature style .</s>

<s>Robert Riefling , who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded 23rd Beethoven Festival , penetrated deep into the spirit of the style .</s>

<s>his readings were careful without being fussy , and they were authoritative without being presumptuous .</s>

<s>the 32 J Minor Variations with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another , leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline .</s>

<s>the J Minor Sonata , Op.</s>

<s>31 No.</s>

<s>2 , introduced by dynamically shaped arpeggios , was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative -- single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way toward the idea to come .</s>

<s>these inwardly dramatic moments showed the kind of opera style of which Beethoven was genuinely capable , but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging .</s>

<s>two late Sonatas , Op.</s>

<s>110 and 111 , were played with similar insight , the disarming simplicities of the Op.</s>

<s>126 .</s>

<s>Herr Riefling , in everything he gave his large Beethoven Hall audience , proved himself as an interpreter of unobtrusive authority .</s>

<s>Volker Wangenheim , who conducted Bonn's Stadtisches Orchester on the following evening , made one more conscious of the process of interpretation .</s>

<s>Herr Wangenheim has only recently become the city's music director , and is a young man with a clear flair for the podium .</s>

<s>but he weighted the Eighth Symphony , at times , with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed considerably at odds with the music .</s>

<s>he might have been hoping , to all appearances , that this relatively sunny symphony , in conjunction with the Choral Fantasy at the end of the program , could amount to something like the Ninth ;
but no amount of head-tossing could make it so .</s>

<s>the conductor's preoccupation with the business of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness , as with the first orchestra entrance in the Fourth Piano Concerto , but when he put his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed , it did so with plenty of spring .</s>

<s>the concerto's soloist , Hans Richter-Haaser , played with compensatory ease and economy , though without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on the previous evening by Herr Riefling .</s>

<s>his was a burgomaster's Beethoven , solid and sensible .</s>

<s>everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the Fantasy For Piano , Chorus , And Orchestra In J Minor , made up by its composer to fill out one of his programs .</s>

<s>the entrance of the Stadtisches Gesangverein ( Bonn's civic chorus ) was worth all the waiting , however , as the young Rhenish voices finally brought the music to life .</s>

<s>the last program of this festival , which during two weeks had sampled most compositional categories , brought the Cologne Rundfunk-Sinfonie-Orchesternp and Rundfunkchor to Bonn's gold-filled hall for a performance of the Missa Solemnis .</s>

<s>a tribe in ancient India believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants , which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise .</s>

<s>this theory eventually proved inexact .</s>

<s>but the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science .</s>

<s>it is the business of cosmologists , the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe , to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors .</s>

<s>these keys are the working principles of physics , mathematics and astronomy , principles which are then extrapolated , or projected , to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge .</s>

<s>in the autumn of 1959 , the British Broadcasting Corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology .</s>

<s>three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator .</s>

<s>the participants were Professor H. Bondi , professor of mathematics at King's College , London ;
Dr. W. B. Bonnor , reader in mathematics at Queen Elizabeth College , London ;
Dr. R. A. Lyttleton , a lecturer at St. John's College , Cambridge , and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the University of Cambridge ;
and Dr. G. J. Whitrow , reader in applied mathematics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology , London .</s>

<s>Dr. Whitrow functioned as moderator .</s>

<s>the programs were so well received by the British public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called , Rival Theories Of Cosmology .</s>

<s>Dr. Bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe , based on the general theory of relativity .</s>

<s>first of all , and this has been calculated by observation , the universe is expanding -- that is , the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds .</s>

<s>because of this Dr. Bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever else is there .</s>

<s>this expansion has been going on for an estimated eight billion years .</s>

<s>expands and contracts
Dr. Bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts , that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in .</s>

<s>then , after many more billions of years , when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center , this movement will slow down and reverse itself again .</s>

<s>Professor Bondi disagrees with the expansion-contraction theory .</s>

<s>he supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space .</s>

<s>for this reason , he says , the density of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are zooming away in all directions .</s>

<s>new galaxies are forever being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies .</s>

<s>if this is true , then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence , even though the universe is expanding .</s>

<s>for new galaxies to be created , Professor Bondi declares , it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of your living room once every few million years .</s>

<s>he contends this idea doesn't conflict with experiments on which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because some slight error must be assumed in such experiments .</s>

<s>Dr. Lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons .</s>

<s>protons and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract each other , and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen -- the basic building block of matter .</s>

<s>the charges of the electron and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite , but Dr. Lyttleton is not so sure .</s>

<s>suppose , says Dr. Lyttleton , the proton has a slightly greater charge than the electron ( so slight it is presently immeasurable ) .</s>

<s>this would give the hydrogen atom a slight charge-excess .</s>

<s>now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms , it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms in the sphere .</s>

<s>because electrical forces ( the charge-excess ) are far more powerful than gravitation , the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot away from the sphere .</s>

<s>Dr. Lyttleton then imagines the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from it .</s>

<s>this , he claims , would reasonably account for the expansion of the universe .</s>

<s>fleeting glimpse
this slim book , while giving the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe , has the appeal that informed conversation always has .</s>

<s>several photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with the discussion , and the smooth language indicates the contributors were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost every field .</s>

<s>it is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new vistas to science .</s>

<s>presently , the intense absorption of ultra-violet rays in the earth's atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation .</s>

<s>these scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the earth's gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic theories .</s>

<s>there would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time accelerating the study of the space around us , giving us a long-sought ladder from which to peer at alien regions .</s>

<s>in doing away with the tea tray , the elephants and the giant tortoise , science has developed a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos .</s>

<s>and although the universe may forever defy understanding , it might even now be finding its match in the imagination of man .</s>

<s>Roots , the new play at the brand-new Mayfair Theater on 46th St. which has been made over from a night club , is about the intellectual and spiritual awakening of an English farm girl .</s>

<s>highly successful in England before its transfer to New York , most of Roots is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are gaudy .</s>

<s>only in its final scene , where Beatie Bryant ( Mary Doyle ) shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for most of the first two and one-half acts .</s>

<s>the burden of Mr. Wesker's message is that people living close to the soil ( at least in England ) are not the happy , fine , strong , natural , earthy people city-bred intellectuals imagine .</s>

<s>rather they are genuine clods , proud of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought .</s>

<s>they care no more for politics , says Mr. Wesker , than they do for a symphony .</s>

<s>seeming to have roots in the soil , they actually have none in life .</s>

<s>they dwell , in short , in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are commonly reported to have lived .</s>

<s>but this is a theme which does not take so much time to state as Mr. Wesker dedicates to it .</s>

<s>so much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest of the theatergoer ( unless he has been living in a gilded palace , perhaps , and wants a real big heap of contrast ) .</s>

<s>the messy meals , the washing of dishes , the drying of clothes may be realism , but there is such a thing as redundancy .</s>

<s>now for the good points .</s>

<s>Miss Doyle as Beatie has a great fund of animal spirits , a strong voice and a warm smile .</s>

<s>she is just home from a sojourn in London where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow named Ronnie ( we never do see him ) and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating , including a dose of good British socialism .</s>

<s>but while she is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open before her , Ronnie has not been able to observe her progress , and instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull , he sends Beatie a letter of dismissal .</s>

<s>Beatie , getting no sympathy for her misfortune , soon rallies and finds that although she has lost a lover she has gained her freedom .</s>

<s>despite a too long sustained declamatory flight , this final speech is convincing , and we see why British audiences apparently were impressed by Roots .</s>

<s>there were several fairly good minor portraits in the play , including William Hansen's impersonation of a stubborn , rather pathetic father , and Katherine Squire's vigorous characterization of a farm mother who brooked no hifalutin' nonsense from her daughter , or anyone else .</s>

<s>but I am afraid Mr. Wesker's meat and potatoes dish isn't well seasoned enough for local audiences .</s>

<s>Shakespeare had a word for everything , even for the rain that disrupted Wednesday night's Much Ado About Nothing opening the season of free theatre in Central Park .</s>

<s>the New York Shakespeare Festival , which is using the Wollman Memorial Skating Rink while its theatre near the Belvedere is being completed , began bravely .</s>

<s>Joseph Papp , impassioned founder of the festival and director of Much Ado , had a vibrant , colorful production under way .</s>

<s>using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with Shakespeare's words in a spirited mixture .</s>

<s>the audience filled all the seats inside the Wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence .</s>

<s>the barbed sallies of Beatrice and Benedick , so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult , raised chuckles .</s>

<s>the simple-minded comedy of Dogberry and Verges , also familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of writers' heads , evoked laughter .</s>

<s>the vivacity of the masquers' party at Leonato's palace , with the Spanish motif in the music and dancing in honor of the visiting Prince of Arragon , cast a spell of delight .</s>

<s>as Much Ado turned serious while the insipid Claudio rejected Hero at the altar , a sprinkle began to fall .</s>

<s>at first hardly a person in the audience moved , although some umbrellas were opened .</s>

<s>but the rain came more heavily , and men and women in light summer clothes began to depart .</s>

<s>the grieving Hero and her father , Leonato , followed by the Friar , left the stage .</s>

<s>a voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes .</s>

<s>more than half the audience departed .</s>

<s>some remained in the Wollman enclosure , fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads .</s>

<s>others huddled under the trees outside the fence .</s>

<s>twenty minutes after the interruption , although it was still raining , the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped .</s>

<s>Beatrice ( Nan Martin ) and Benedick ( J. D. Cannon ) took their places on the stage .</s>

<s>in their very first speeches it was clear that Shakespeare , like a Nostradamus , had foreseen this moment .</s>

<s>said Benedick : Lady Beatrice , have you wept all this while ?</s>

<s>replied Beatrice : yea , and I will weep a while longer .</s>

<s>the heavens refused to give up their weeping .</s>

<s>the gallant company completed Act 4 and got through part of Act 5 .</s>

<s>but the final scenes could not be played .</s>

<s>if any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour are in doubt about how it comes out , let them take comfort .</s>

<s>Much Ado ends happily .</s>

<s>the Parks Department has done an admirable job of preparing the Wollman Rink for Shakespeare .</s>

<s>one could hardly blame Newbold Morris , the Parks Commissioner , for devoting so much grateful mention to the department's technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms , its balcony , its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains .</s>

<s>Eldon Elder , who designed the stage , also created a gay , spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and Shakespeare's lighthearted mood .</s>

<s>Mr. Papp has directed a performance that has verve and pace , although he has tolerated obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable .</s>

<s>Elisabeth Schwarzkopf sang so magnificently Saturday night at Hunter College that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints .</s>

<s>still a demurrer or two must be entered .</s>

<s>Schwarzkopf is , of course , Schwarzkopf .</s>

<s>for style and assurance , for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her .</s>

<s>if the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be , it is still a beautiful instrument , controlled and flexible .</s>

<s>put to the service of lieder of Schubert , Brahms , Strauss and Wolf in a dramatical and musical way , it made its effect with ease and precision .</s>

<s>but what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism .</s>

<s>instead of her old confidence in the simplest , purest , most moving musical expression , Miss Schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride -- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra , some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside .</s>

<s>the symptoms Saturday night were unmistakable .</s>

<s>clever light songs were overly coy , tragic songs a little too melodramatic .</s>

<s>there was an extra pause here , a gasp or a sigh there , here and there an extra little twist of a word or note , all in the interest of effect .</s>

<s>the result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness .</s>

<s>there were stunning musical phrases too , and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication .</s>

<s>Miss Schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist , John Wustman , often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition .</s>

<s>all the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills ;
Miss Schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them .</s>

<s>the dance , dancers and dance enthusiasts ( 8,500 of them ) had a much better time of it at Lewisohn Stadium on Saturday night than all had had two nights earlier , when Stadium Concerts presented the first of two dance programs .</s>

<s>on Saturday , the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field , the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing , and the order of the program improved .</s>

<s>there was , additionally , a bonus for the Saturday-night patrons .</s>

<s>Alvin Ailey and Carmen De Lavallade appeared in the first New York performance of Mr. Ailey's Roots Of The Blues , a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the Boston Arts Festival .</s>

<s>otherwise , the program included , as on Thursday , the Taras-Tchaikovsky Design For Strings , the Dollar-Britten Divertimento , the Dollar-De Banfield The Duel and the pas de deux from The Nutcracker .</s>

<s>Maria Tallchief and Erik Bruhn , who danced the Nutcracker pas de deux , were also seen in the Petipa-Minkus pas de deux from Don Quixote , another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely .</s>

<s>among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening , Elisabeth Carroll and Ivan Allen were particularly impressive in their roles in The Duel , a work that depends so much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants .</s>

<s>Mr. Ailey's Roots Of The Blues , an earthy and very human modern dance work , provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening .</s>

<s>as Brother John Sellers sang five blues to the guitar and drum accompaniments of Bruce Langhorne and Shep Shepard , Mr. Ailey and Miss De Lavallade went through volatile dances that were by turns insinuating , threatening , contemptuous and ecstatic .</s>

<s>their props were two stepladders , a chair and a palm fan .</s>

<s>he wore the clothes of a laborer , and she was wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress .</s>

<s>the cat-like sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps , lifts , crawls and slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong , sometimes almost frightening , tensions .</s>

<s>Roots Of The Blues may not be for gentle souls , but others should welcome its super-charged impact .</s>

<s>perhaps it is better to stay at home .</s>

<s>the armchair traveler preserves his illusions .</s>

<s>this somewhat cynical comment may be found in Blue Skies , Brown Studies , a collection of travel essays by William Sansom , who would never consider staying home for long .</s>

<s>Mr. Sansom is English , bearded , formidably cultivated , the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories , of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between .</s>

<s>the only man alive who seems qualified by his learning , his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of Sacheverell Sitwell , Mr. Sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a Hungarian beauty ( her third ) and an American multimillionaire ( his fourth ) .</s>

<s>the result is rather wonderful , but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices .</s>

<s>there are sixteen essays in Blue Skies , Brown Studies .</s>

<s>most of them were written between 1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines .</s>

<s>all are well written and are overwritten .</s>

<s>but , even if Mr. Sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow , he still can charm and astound .</s>

<s>too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another .</s>

<s>Mr. Sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence , with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources of English , with a thick shower of sophisticated , cultural references .</s>

<s>a contemplative connoisseur
I like to sniff a place , and reproduce what it really smells and looks like , its color , its particular kind of life .</s>

<s>this is an exact description of what Mr. Sansom does .</s>

<s>he ignores guidebook facts .</s>

<s>he only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches an individual or quotes his opinions .</s>

<s>it is an over-all impression Mr. Sansom strives for , an impression compounded of visual details , of a savory mixture of smells , of much loving attention to architecture and scenery , of lights and shadows , of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past .</s>

<s>William Sansom writes only about Europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as London , Vienna , the French Riviera and the Norwegian fjords .</s>

<s>but no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions .</s>

<s>a writer lives , at best , in a state of astonishment , he says .</s>

<s>beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all .</s>

<s>to transmit that feeling he writes .</s>

<s>this may not be true of many writers , but it certainly is true of Mr. Sansom .</s>

<s>so in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of St. Torpetius that still persists in St. Tropez ;
at the sun and the heat of Mediterranean lands , always much brighter and hotter to an Englishman than to an American used to summers in New York or Kansas City ;
at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world's finest restaurants , La Bonne Auberge , which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the Nice airport ;
and at the infinite variety of London .</s>

<s>Mr. Sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls ( to those who recall easily ) the statues of Bernini and the gigantic paintings of Tintoretto .</s>

<s>he can coin a neat phrase : a street spattered with an invigoration of people ;
tulips with petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel's ears ;
after a snowstorm a landscape smelling of woodsmoke and clarity .</s>

<s>and , for all his lacquered , almost Byzantine self-consciousness , he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison .</s>

<s>beauty borrowed from
afar in one of his best essays Mr. Sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by Andrea Palladio himself that dot the environs of Vicenza .</s>

<s>how far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence Mr. Sansom reminds us thus : the white colonnaded , cedar-roofed Southern mansion is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied England to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue South , the Palladian orbit stretching out from Vicenza : the old mind of Andrea Palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a Southern porch , the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen , his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep , his sense of columns framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple of mating lips .</s>

<s>nice , even if a trifle gaudy .</s>

<s>Blue Skies , Brown Studies is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs .</s>

<s>in recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television , but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio .</s>

<s>WBAI , the listener-supported outlet on the frequency-modulation band , has decided to do what it can to correct this aural void .</s>

<s>yesterday it offered Poised For Violence , by Jean Reavey .</s>

<s>WBAI is on the right track : in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre , as the Canadian and British Broadcasting Corporations continue to demonstrate .</s>

<s>unfortunately , Poised For Violence was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point .</s>

<s>Mrs. Reavey's work is written for the stage -- it is mentioned for an off-Broadway production in the fall -- and , in addition , employs an avant-garde structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension is to be encouraged .</s>

<s>the play's device is to explore society's obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artist's models who remain part of someone else's painting rather than just be themselves .</s>

<s>in a succession of scenes they appear in different guises -- patrons of a cafe , performers in a circus and participants in a family picnic -- but in each instance they inevitably put ugliness before beauty .</s>

<s>somewhere in Mrs. Reavey's play there is both protest and aspiration of merit .</s>

<s>but its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listener's stamina begins to wilt .</s>

<s>moreover , her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankind's ills .</s>

<s>but quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author's words .</s>

<s>which in itself is an immediate reward of the J experiment ;
good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration .</s>

<s>a weekly showcase for contemporary music , from the austere archaism of Stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music , is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month .</s>

<s>titled What's New In Music ?</s>

<s>the enterprising program is heard Saturday afternoons on radio station J .</s>

<s>the brief notes introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points , and many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by the hand through an often difficult maze .</s>

<s>the show is programed and written by the station's assistant continuity editor , Chuck Briefer .</s>

<s>the first Saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings .</s>

<s>last Saturday's interesting melange included Ernst Toch , Karlheinz Stockhausen , Richard Yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new space opera by the Swedish composer , Karl-Birger Blomdahl .</s>

<s>other Saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected American composer , a particular type of music or the music of a given country .</s>

<s>it is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene .</s>

<s>but one wishes , when the appetite is whetted , as it was in the case of the all-too-brief excerpt from the Blomdahl opera , that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions .</s>

<s>the Moiseyev Dance Company dropped in at Madison Square Garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long American tour to a close .</s>

<s>it is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its New York engagement earlier this season , but has brought back many of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody's heart .</s>

<s>it is good to see those numbers again .</s>

<s>the Suite Of Old Russian Dances that opened that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into typical Moiseyev vigor and warmth ;
the amusing Yurochka , in which a hard-to-please young man is given his come-uppance ;
the lovely ( and of course vigorous ) Polyanka or The Meadow ;
the three Moldavian dances entitled Zhok ;
the sweet and funny little dance about potato planting called Bul'ba ;
and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called City Quadrille are all just as good as one remembers them to have been , and they are welcome back .</s>

<s>so , for that matter , are the newer dances -- the Kalmuk Dance with its animal movements , that genial juggling act by Sergei Tsvetkov called The Platter , the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called Summer , The Three Shepherds of Azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs , and , of course , the trenchant Rock 'n' Roll .</s>

<s>as autumn starts its annual sweep , few Americans and Canadians realize how fortunate they are in having the world's finest fall coloring .</s>

<s>spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire land surface of the earth .</s>

<s>the only other regions so blessed are the British Isles , western Europe , eastern China , southern Chile and parts of Japan , New Zealand and Tasmania .</s>

<s>their autumn tints are all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson , gold , purple , bronze , blue and vermilion that flame up in North America .</s>

<s>Jack Frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle ;

<s>the best effects come from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain , followed by sunny days and cool nights .</s>

<s>a year ago it was bruited that the primary character in Erich Maria Remarque's new novel was based on the Marquis Alfonso De Portago , the Spanish nobleman who died driving in the Mille Miglia automobile race of 1957 .</s>

<s>if this was in fact Mr. Remarque's intention he has achieved a notable failure .</s>

<s>Clerfayt of Heaven Has No Favorites resembles Portago only in that he is male and a race-driver -- quite a bad race-driver , whereas Portago was a good one .</s>

<s>he is a dull , unformed , and aimless person ;
the twelfth Marquis De Portago was intelligent , purposeful , and passionate .</s>

<s>one looked forward to Mr. Remarque's ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing , as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised .</s>

<s>unhappily , Heaven Has No Favorites does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list .</s>

<s>Mr. Remarque's conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble .</s>

<s>he proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery .</s>

<s>his treatment of it is something else .</s>

<s>his heroine chooses to die -- the price of recovery , years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium , being higher than she wishes to pay .</s>

<s>her lover precedes her in death , at the wheel , and presumably he too has chosen .</s>

<s>between the first meeting of Clerfayt and Lillian and this dismal denouement , Mr. Remarque has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse , some demure and rather fetching love-making , pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of Europe , and a modicum of automobile racing .</s>

<s>the ramblings on life , death , and the wonder of it all are distressing ;
the love-making , perhaps because it is pale and low-key when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness , is often charming ;
the automobile racing bears little relation to reality .</s>

<s>this latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author drawn Clerfayt as , say , a tournament golfer .</s>

<s>hazards to life and limb on the golf course , while existent , are actuarially insignificant .</s>

<s>race-drivers , on the other hand , are quite often killed on the circuit , and since it was obviously Mr. Remarque's intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm , one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques but of mores and attitudes .</s>

<s>he does not .</s>

<s>the jacket biography describes him as a former racing driver , and he may indeed have been , although I do not recall having encountered his name either in the records or the literature .</s>

<s>perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal .</s>

<s>the book carries a disclaimer in which Remarque says it has been necessary for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities of racing .</s>

<s>the necessity is not clear to me , and , in any case , to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car , which , or whom , he calls Giuseppe , parked on the Place Vendome sneering at a dozen Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked around him is not a liberty ;
it is an absurdity .</s>

<s>but it is in the matter of preoccupation with death , which is the primary concern of the book , that Remarque's failure is plainest .</s>

<s>Clerfayt is neurotic , preoccupied , and passive .</s>

<s>to be human , he believes , is to seek one's own destruction : the Freudian death-wish cliche inevitably cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers .</s>

<s>in point of fact , the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent , healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live .</s>

<s>a Clerfayt may moon on about the face of Death in the cockpit ;
a Portago could say , as he did say to me , if I die tomorrow , still I have had twenty-eight wonderful years ;
but I shan't die tomorrow ;
I'll live to be 105 .</s>

<s>Clerfayt , transported , may think of the engine driving his car as a mystical beast under the hood .</s>

<s>the Italian master Piero Taruffi , no less sensitive , knows twice the ecstasy though he thinks of a car's adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae .</s>

<s>Clerfayt , driving , sees himself a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell ;
the Briton Stirling Moss , one of the greatest virtuosi of all time , believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related to ballet .</s>

<s>errors in technical terminology suggest that the over-all translation from the German may not convey quite everything Mr. Remarque hoped to tell us .</s>

<s>however , my principal objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers , pilots , submariners , atomic researchers , and all the machine-masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists .</s>

<s>the west is leaderless , according to this book .</s>

<s>in contrast , the East is ably led by such stalwart heroes as Khrushchev , Tito , and Mao .</s>

<s>against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all .</s>

<s>it is Field Marshal Montgomery's belief that in most Western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or Christianity ;
about 30 per cent call themselves Christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered respectable , and only the last 10 per cent are genuine Christians and believers in democracy .</s>

<s>but these Western countries do care about themselves .</s>

<s>each feels intensely national .</s>

<s>if , say , the Russians intended to stop Tom Jones' going to the pub , then Tom Jones would fight the Commies .</s>

<s>but he would fight for his own liberty rather than for any abstract principle connected with it -- such as cause .</s>

<s>for all practical purposes , the West stands disunited , undedicated , and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership .</s>

<s>with this barrage , Montgomery of Alamein launches his attack upon the blunderings of the West .</s>

<s>never given to mincing words , he places heavy blame upon the faulty , uncourageous leadership of Britain and particularly America .</s>

<s>at war's end leadership in Western Europe passed from Britain because the Labour Government devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare state .</s>

<s>with Britain looking inward , overseas problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the United States .</s>

<s>Montgomery believes that she started well .</s>

<s>America gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike .</s>

<s>she pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into prosperity , but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace .</s>

<s>America has divided more than she has united the West .</s>

<s>the reasons are that America generally believes that she can buy anything with dollars , and that she compulsively strives to be liked .</s>

<s>however , she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by a quality of leadership that is basically needed .</s>

<s>but the greater reason for fumbling , stumbling American leadership is due to the shock her pride suffered when the Japanese attacked at Pearl Harbor .</s>

<s>they are determined , Montgomery writes , not to be surprised again , and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not only unnecessary , but also creates nervousness among other nations in the Western Alliance -- not to mention such great suspicions among the nations of the Eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible .</s>

<s>the net result is that under American leadership the general world situation has become bad .</s>

<s>to Monty , the American people , who in two previous world wars were very reluctant to join the fight , now look like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third World War .</s>

<s>as faulty as has been our leadership clearly the United States must be relied upon to lead .</s>

<s>the path to leadership is made clear .</s>

<s>Montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the West's own house in order .</s>

<s>such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group , a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence .</s>

<s>this leader must be a man who lives above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of the United States , namely that Russia will agree to a reunited Germany , that the East German government does not exist , that events in Japan in June 1960 were Communist-inspired , that the true government of China is in Formosa , that Mao was the evil influence behind Khrushchev at the Summit Conference in Paris in May 1960 , and that either China or Russia wants or expects war .</s>

<s>such a leader must strengthen J politically , and establish that true unity about which it has always talked .</s>

<s>after drastically overhauling J , Western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that tear apart the East and West .</s>

<s>major to this effort is to get all world powers to withdraw to their own territories , say by 1970 .</s>

<s>the West should make the central proposal ;
but the East would have to show sincerity in carrying it out .</s>

<s>but where is the leader who will handle all these things for us ?</s>

<s>Montgomery knew all the national leaders up to the time of Kennedy .</s>

<s>the man whom he would select as our leader for this great task is De Gaulle .</s>

<s>he alone has the wisdom , the conviction , the tenacity , and the courage to reach a decision .</s>

<s>but De Gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring France's lost soul .</s>

<s>whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous path to leadership .</s>

<s>the leader Montgomery envisages will need to discipline himself , lead a carefully regulated and orderly life , allow time for quiet thought and reflection , adapt decisions and plans to changing situations , be ruthless , particularly with inefficiency , and be honest and morally proper .</s>

<s>all in all , Montgomery calls for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him .</s>

<s>in looking as far back as Moses , thence to Cromwell , Napoleon , Lincoln , Churchill , and Nehru , Montgomery attempts to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men .</s>

<s>he believes that greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented by Churchill , who would very possibly have gone down in history as a political failure if it had not been for Hitler's war .</s>

<s>however , Montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice .</s>

<s>most of what is said about his great men of history has already been said , and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene .</s>

<s>like Eisenhower , he holds the militarist's suspicion of politicians .</s>

<s>however , at the same time Montgomery selects as his hero De Gaulle , who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions .</s>

<s>Monty shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support .</s>

<s>for the most part , his writing rambles and jogs , preventing easy access by the reader to his true thoughts .</s>

<s>nevertheless , Montgomery has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the Western world .</s>

<s>it suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership .</s>

<s>and it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events .</s>

<s>it is no common thing for a listener ( critical or otherwise ) to hear a singer live for the first time only after he has died .</s>

<s>but then , Mario Lanza was no common singer , and his whole career , public and non-public , was studded with the kind of unconventional happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first recital only when he has ceased to be a living voice .</s>

<s>it is a kind of justice , too , that it should originate in London's Royal Albert Hall , where , traditionally , the loudest , if not the greatest , performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate ( RCA Victor J 2454 , $4.98 ) .</s>

<s>to be sure , Lanza made numerous concert tours , here and abroad , but these did not take him to New York where the carping critic might lurk .</s>

<s>the reading public , the theatergoing public , the skindiving public , the horse-playing public -- all these and others fill substantial roles in U.S. life , but none is so varied , vast and vigilant as the eating public .</s>

<s>the Department of Agriculture averaged out U.S. food consumption last year at 1,488 lbs.</s>

<s>through previous centuries , eating changed by nearly imperceptible degrees , and mostly toward just getting enough .</s>

<s>now big forces buffet food .</s>

<s>for the first time in history , the U.S. has produced a society in which less than one-tenth of the people turn out so much food that the Government's most embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million tons of surplus farm produce .</s>

<s>in this same society , the plain citizen can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than he can consume .</s>

<s>refrigeration , automated processing and packaging conspire to defy season and banish spoilage .</s>

<s>and in the wake of the new affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new American interest in how what people eat affects their health .</s>

<s>to eat is human , the nation is learning to think , to survive divine .</s>

<s>fads , facts

<s>each year , reports the American Medical Association , ten million Americans spend $900 million on vitamins , tonics and other food supplements .</s>

<s>at juice bars in Los Angeles' 35 health stores , a new sensation is a pink , high-protein cocktail , concocted of dried eggs , powdered milk and cherry-flavored No-Cal , which sells for 59-cents per 8-oz.</s>

<s>glass .</s>

<s>grocery stores sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all .</s>

<s>but a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet and health , and a big group of U.S. scientists wants to supply them .</s>

<s>the man most firmly at grips with the problem is the University of Minnesota's Physiologist Ancel Keys , 57 , inventor of the wartime J ( for Keys ) ration and author of last year's bestselling Eat Well And Stay Well .</s>

<s>from his birch-paneled office in the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene , under the university's football stadium in Minneapolis ( we get a rumble on every touchdown ) , blocky , grey-haired Dr. Keys directs an ambitious , $200,000-a-year experiment on diet , which spans three continents and seven nations and is still growing .</s>

<s>pursuing it , he has logged 500,000 miles , suffered indescribable digestive indignities , and meticulously collected physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10,000 individuals , from Bantu tribesmen to Italian contadini .</s>

<s>he has measured the skinfolds ( the fleshy areas under the shoulder blades ) of Neapolitan firemen , studied the metabolism of Finnish woodcutters , analyzed the mealie-meal eaten by Capetown coloreds , and experimented on Minneapolis businessmen .</s>

<s>and fats .</s>

<s>Keys's findings , though far from complete , are likely to smash many an eating cliche .</s>

<s>vitamins , eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on ( though mothers' milk is still the ticket ) .</s>

<s>readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood , which seem to have value in predicting heart attacks , are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram , which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack .</s>

<s>already many an American knows his count , and rejoices or worries depending on whether it is nearer 180 ( safe ) or 250 ( dangerous ) .</s>

<s>out of cholesterol come Keys's main messages so far : Americans eat too much .</s>

<s>the typical U.S. daily menu , says Dr. Keys , contains 3,000 calories , should contain 2,300 .</s>

<s>and extra weight increases the risk of cancer , diabetes , artery disease and heart attack .</s>

<s>Americans eat too much fat .</s>

<s>with meat , milk , butter and ice cream , the calorie-heavy U.S. diet is 40% fat , and most of that is saturated fat -- the insidious kind , says Dr. Keys , that increases blood cholesterol , damages arteries , and leads to coronary disease .</s>

<s>obesity : a malnutrition .</s>

<s>throughout much of the world , food is still so scarce that half of the earth's population has trouble getting the 1,600 calories a day necessary to sustain life .</s>

<s>the deficiency diseases -- scurvy , tropical sprue , pellagra -- run rampant .</s>

<s>in West Africa , for example , where meat is a luxury and babies must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals , a childhood menace is kwashiorkor , or Red Johnny , a growth-stunting protein deficiency ( signs : reddish hair , bloated belly ) that kills more than half its victims , leaves the rest prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease .</s>

<s>in the well-fed U.S. , deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years .</s>

<s>today , as Harrison's Principles Of Internal Medicine , a standard internist's text , puts it , the most common form of malnutrition is caloric excess or obesity .</s>

<s>Puritan New England regarded obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance , and thus a sin .</s>

<s>says Keys : maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral , the fat man would start to think .</s>

<s>morals aside , the fat man has plenty to worry about -- over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him .</s>

<s>the simple mechanical strain of overweight , says New York's Dr. Norman Jolliffe , can overburden and damage the heart for much the same reason that a Chevrolet engine in a Cadillac body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built .</s>

<s>the fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay higher premiums .</s>

<s>he has -- for unclear reasons -- a 25% higher death rate from cancer .</s>

<s>he is particularly vulnerable to diabetes .</s>

<s>he may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable , because excess body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement .</s>

<s>physiologically , people overeat because what Dr. Jolliffe calls the appestat is set too high .</s>

<s>the appestat , which adjusts the appetite to keep weight constant , is located , says Jolliffe , in the hypothalamus -- near the body's temperature , sleep and water-balance controls .</s>

<s>physical exercise raises the appestat .</s>

<s>so does cold weather .</s>

<s>in moderate doses , alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances appetite ( the original reason for the cocktail ) ;
but because liquor has a high caloric value -- 100 calories per oz.</s>

<s>-- the heavy drinker is seldom hungry .</s>

<s>in rare cases , diseases such as encephalitis or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently , destroying nearly all sense of satiety .</s>

<s>food for frustration .</s>

<s>far more frequently , overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion .</s>

<s>it may be fostered by frustration , depression , insecurity -- or , in children , simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging .</s>

<s>some families place undue emphasis on food : conversations center on it , and rich delicacies are offered as rewards , withheld as punishment .</s>

<s>the result says Jolliffe : the child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life .</s>

<s>food may act as a sedative , giving temporary emotional solace , just as , for some people , alcohol does .</s>

<s>reports Dr. Keys : a fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more .</s>

<s>he may be interested in another woman , or just like being with the boys .</s>

<s>so she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake .</s>

<s>it's a matter of boredom , and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something , because she's being deprived of something else .</s>

<s>for the army of compulsive eaters -- from the nibblers and the gobblers to the downright gluttons -- reducing is a war with the will that is rarely won .</s>

<s>physiologist Keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants as the amphetamines ( Benzedrine , Dexedrine ) as dangerous crutches for a weak will .</s>

<s>Keys has no such objections to Metrecal , Quaker Oats's Quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are currently winning favor from dieters .</s>

<s>Metrecal is a pretty complete food , he says .</s>

<s>it contains large amounts of protein , vitamins and minerals .</s>

<s>in the quantity of 900 calories a day , anyone will lose weight on it -- 20 , 30 or 40 lbs.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>but Keys worries that the Metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food .</s>

<s>that remarkable cholesterol .</s>

<s>despite his personal distaste for obesity ( disgusting ) , Dr. Keys has only an incidental interest in how much Americans eat .</s>

<s>what concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nation's No.</s>

<s>1 killer : coronary artery disease , which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills 500,000 Americans a year -- twice the toll from all varieties of cancer , five times the deaths from automobile accidents .</s>

<s>cholesterol , the cornerstone of Dr. Keys's theory , is a mysterious yellowish , waxy substance , chemically a crystalline alcohol .</s>

<s>scientists assume that cholesterol ( from the Greek chole , meaning bile , and sterios , meaning solid ) is somehow necessary for the formation of brain cells , since it accounts for about 2% of the brain's total solid weight .</s>

<s>they know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones .</s>

<s>they suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones , and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory system .</s>

<s>but they cannot fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver .</s>

<s>although the fatty protein molecules , carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol , are water soluble , cholesterol itself is insoluble , and cannot be destroyed by the body .</s>

<s>a remarkable substance , says Dr. Keys , quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries .</s>

<s>when thus deposited , Keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks .</s>

<s>explains Keys : as the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream , they are deposited in the intima , or inner wall of a coronary artery .</s>

<s>the proteins and fats are burned off , and the cholesterol is left behind .</s>

<s>as cholesterol piles up , it narrows , irritates and damages the artery , encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation .</s>

<s>eventually , says Keys , one of two things happens .</s>

<s>a clot forms at the site , seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes a heart attack .</s>

<s>or ( more commonly , thinks Keys ) the deposits themselves get so big that they choke off the artery's flow to the point that an infarct occurs : the heart muscle is suffocated , cells supplied by the artery die , and the heart is permanently , perhaps fatally injured .</s>

<s>fats & coronaries .</s>

<s>ordinarily , the human liver synthesizes only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body's needs -- for transportation of fats and for production of bile .</s>

<s>even eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods , eaten in normal amounts , says Dr. Keys , do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood .</s>

<s>but fatty foods do .</s>

<s>during World War 2 , doctors in The Netherlands and Scandinavia noted a curious fact : despite the stresses of Nazi occupation , the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping .</s>

<s>not until long after the war -- 1950 , in fact -- did they get a hint of the reason .</s>

<s>that year , Sweden's Haqvin Malmros showed that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods .</s>

<s>that same year the University of California's Dr. Laurance Kinsell , timing oxidation rates of blood fats , stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically , while animal fats cause them to rise .</s>

<s>here Keys and others , such as Dr. A. E. Ahrens of the Rockefeller Institute , took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fats -- and even between different varieties of each .</s>

<s>all natural food fats fall into one of three categories -- saturated , mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated .</s>

<s>the degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the fat molecule .</s>

<s>saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens .</s>

<s>mono-unsaturated fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule , and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens .</s>

<s>the three fats have similar caloric values ( about 265 calories per oz. )</s>

<s>, but each exerts a radically different influence on blood cholesterol .</s>

<s>as a result , although we still make use of this distinction , there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed .</s>

<s>just what is meant by spirit and by matter ?</s>

<s>the terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all .</s>

<s>yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do .</s>

<s>for in the modern world neither spirit nor matter refer to any generally agreed-upon elements of experience .</s>

<s>we are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected .</s>

<s>when the words are used , we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind , or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours .</s>

<s>one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit .</s>

<s>just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities .</s>

<s>not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true .</s>

<s>demons , fairies , angels , and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars .</s>

<s>in such a world the words matter and spirit both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all .</s>

<s>in it important elements of Christianity and of the Biblical view of reality in general , which now cause us much difficulty , could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously .</s>

<s>the progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it .</s>

<s>in carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit .</s>

<s>the objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support .</s>

<s>science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time .</s>

<s>when , therefore , it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit , these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality .</s>

<s>in doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions , removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions .</s>

<s>there have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful .</s>

<s>all this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing .</s>

<s>the scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough .</s>

<s>the house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means , or at best with wholly inadequate means , for dealing with his experience of spirit .</s>

<s>although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly defective , the raw experience itself which led to such excesses remains with us as vividly as ever .</s>

<s>we simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience .</s>

<s>there is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality , as we know and apprehend it , with respect to which we can refer this experience .</s>

<s>science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives .</s>

<s>the situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in Arthur Miller's play The Crucible , which deals with the Salem witch trials .</s>

<s>as the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of Salem in Puritan America at the end of the eighteenth century .</s>

<s>aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community .</s>

<s>the conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures , foibles , irritations , and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age .</s>

<s>there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people .</s>

<s>instead , the audience can sit back at ease and , from the perspective of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things , enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion .</s>

<s>a teenage girl , Abigail Williams , is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle , the Reverend Samuel Parris , about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings .</s>

<s>for all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air .</s>

<s>as the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community .</s>

<s>everyone in Salem , saint and sinner alike , is swept up by it .</s>

<s>it is like a mysterious epidemic which , starting first with Abigail and Parris , spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it .</s>

<s>it grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery , moral disintegration , and destruction .</s>

<s>the audience leaves the play under a spell , it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes .</s>

<s>if one asks about this play , what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power , there is no better answer to give than spirit .</s>

<s>this is not to attempt to say what spirit is , but only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a common experience .</s>

<s>in the end the good man , John Proctor , expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says , a fire , a fire is burning ]
I hear the boot of Lucifer , I see his filthy face ]
the tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them .</s>

<s>we marvel at their blindness for not seeing this .</s>

<s>yet are not we of the mid-twentieth century , who rightly do not believe there is any such thing as the devil , just as bad off as they -- only in a different way ?</s>

<s>in our disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in this play .</s>

<s>we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false .</s>

<s>even Mr. Miller himself seems uncertain on this score .</s>

<s>in a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play , he says at one point : however , that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of Lucifer's many-faced lieutenants .</s>

<s>and his belief is not to his discredit .</s>

<s>better minds than Hale's were -- and still are -- convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken .</s>

<s>( page 33 ) on the other hand , a little later on he says : since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped out God's beard and the Devil's horns , but the world is still gripped between two diametrically opposed absolutes .</s>

<s>the concept of unity , in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force , in which good and evil are relative , ever-changing , and always joined to the same phenomenon -- such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas .</s>

<s>when we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man's worthlessness -- until redeemed -- the necessity of the Devil may become evident as a weapon , a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or church-state .</s>

<s>( page 34 ) apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real .</s>

<s>yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over Salem .</s>

<s>it casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power .</s>

<s>it is not enough in accounting for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect .</s>

<s>for this does not account for the integral , elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds , nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell .</s>

<s>the reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's convictions to the contrary .</s>

<s>spirit and community
there is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit .</s>

<s>apart from spirit there could be no community , for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity , cohesiveness , and permanence .</s>

<s>think , for example , of the spirit of the Marine Corps .</s>

<s>surely this is a reality we all acknowledge .</s>

<s>we cannot , of course , assign it any substance .</s>

<s>it is not material and is not a thing occupying space and time .</s>

<s>yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known .</s>

<s>so it is too with many other spirits which we all know : the spirit of Nazism or Communism , school spirit , the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team , the spirit of Rotary or the Ku Klux Klan .</s>

<s>every community , if it is alive has a spirit , and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity .</s>

<s>in searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit , the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most fruitful .</s>

<s>for it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit .</s>

<s>it is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere .</s>

<s>it is the spirit which is the source of a community's drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and prospers .</s>

<s>yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community .</s>

<s>the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas .</s>

<s>one characteristic of the spirit in community is its givenness .</s>

<s>the members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them .</s>

<s>it is for them a given which they and they alone possess .</s>

<s>the spirit of the Marine Corps was present and operative before any of the present members of it came into it .</s>

<s>it is they , of course , who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the Corps for future recruits to find as they come into it .</s>

<s>if the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be understanded of the people -- and this , it must not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task -- there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation .</s>

<s>this does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching .</s>

<s>the absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann's intention .</s>

<s>his point is not that mythology may not be used , but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma .</s>

<s>when we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding of existence .</s>

<s>mythological concepts may by all means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as symbols or ciphers , that is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological ( or existential ) terms .</s>

<s>the statement is often made that when Bultmann argues in this way , he overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the Christian faith .</s>

<s>but this statement is completely unconvincing .</s>

<s>if Bultmann's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant .</s>

<s>nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated .</s>

<s>on the contrary , even in the heart of the Bible belt itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way , together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself and his world .</s>

<s>in fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann's argument is disclosed .</s>

<s>although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence .</s>

<s>this is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class .</s>

<s>time and again in counseling and teaching , one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their fundamentalist heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious .</s>

<s>the same thing is also evidenced by the extreme culture-Protestantism so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the American churches .</s>

<s>in the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand -- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of folk religion current in the situation .</s>

<s>this is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman Vincent Peale's cult of reassurance or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel .</s>

<s>but it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected .</s>

<s>however , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace .</s>

<s>to be sure , when this is pointed out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about the little flock and the great crowd and to take solace from Paul's castigation of the wisdom of the wise in the opening chapter of First Corinthians .</s>

<s>but can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation ?</s>

<s>can the church risk assuming that the folly of men is as dear to God as their wisdom , or , as is also commonly implied , that the foolishness of God and the foolishness of men are simply two ways of talking about the same thing ?</s>

<s>can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ?</s>

<s>there is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from the Bible ) that God is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world .</s>

<s>by analogy , the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the world in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church .</s>

<s>but , as Scripture everywhere reminds us , God does have need of his creatures , and the church , a fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by God's providence , presents it .</s>

<s>and yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men .</s>

<s>until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends .</s>

<s>in arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved ;
and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction .</s>

<s>but the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable .</s>

<s>this is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition .</s>

<s>if to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise say no , or where I do not have the right to say anything at all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian .</s>

<s>expressed differently : if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus Christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind -- sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus -- then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid .</s>

<s>this must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter .</s>

<s>modern man , as Dietrich Bonhoeffer has told us , has come of age ;
and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ;
and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it .</s>

<s>in any event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen fit to place us .</s>

<s>to say this , of course , is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years , or , at any rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought .</s>

<s>we have aligned ourselves with that liberal tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at least , Bultmann .</s>

<s>it is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong .</s>

<s>for we must number here not only the names of Bushnell , Clarke , and Rauschenbusch , not to mention those of the Chicago School and Macintosh , but those of the brothers Niebuhr and ( if America may claim him ]
) Tillich as well .</s>

<s>finally , we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously neoliberal movement that developed at the University of Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of Alfred North Whitehead .</s>

<s>what makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world .</s>

<s>although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity .</s>

<s>they have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to God , have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him .</s>

<s>when we say , then , that today , in our situation , the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition , we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement .</s>

<s>however much we may have to criticize liberal theology's constructive formulations , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it .</s>

<s>in affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann's attempt to formulate such a theology has led .</s>

<s>for we have said , in effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative .</s>

<s>if the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the right is clearly untenable .</s>

<s>whereas Bultmann's center position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the right , as represented , say , by Karl Barth , involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered .</s>

<s>it follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the left , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz Buri and , to some extent at least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology .</s>

<s>in order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length .</s>

<s>we may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri .</s>

<s>to do this , it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two , then the question of a third possibility is a meaningless question .</s>

<s>thus , if what is at issue is whether all J is J , it is indifferent whether some J is not J or no J is J , since in either case the judgment in question is false .</s>

<s>hence , if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ;
for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded .</s>

<s>therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on the one hand , by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and , on the other hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann .</s>

<s>a second point requires more extended comment .</s>

<s>it will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the right , as represented by Barth , rests on the following thesis : the only tenable alternative to Bultmann's position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ;
( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ;
and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus Christ by means of statements that , from Bultmann's point of view , are mythological .</s>

<s>one hundred years ago there existed in England the Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom .</s>

<s>representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the Roman and Anglican Churches , and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to Rome , this association produced little fruit , and , in fact , was condemned by the Holy Office in 1864 .</s>

<s>now again in 1961 , in England , there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as Christian unity .</s>

<s>the Church Unity Octave , January 18-25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches .</s>

<s>many people seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 .</s>

<s>but it must be readily seen that the religious picture in England has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at least on the Catholic side .</s>

<s>for the tide is well on the turn , as the London Catholic weekly Universe has written .</s>

<s>I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal Newman .</s>

<s>as an American Catholic of Irish ancestry , I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ;
being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th-century literature of England , I knew only a Protestant-dominated country .</s>

<s>since arriving here , however , I have formed a far different religious picture of present-day England .</s>

<s>in representing part of this new picture , I will be recounting some of my own personal experiences , reactions and judgments ;
but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the Roman and Anglican Churches and about the present religious state of England .</s>

<s>since the Protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my Roman collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman Catholic cleric .</s>

<s>in any case , I have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by Englishmen , even in Devonshire and Cornwall , where anti-Catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest .</s>

<s>nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism .</s>

<s>on my first Guy Fawkes Day here , I found Catholics as well as non-Catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires , and was told that most Englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day .</s>

<s>a Birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled The True Story of Guy Fawkes , which began : when you pile your guy on the bonfire tomorrow night , I wonder how much of the true story of Guy Fawkes you will remember ?</s>

<s>in the 355 years since the first Guy Fawkes Night , much of the story has been forgotten , so here is a reminder .</s>

<s>the article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a Catholic plot to kill King James 1 .</s>

<s>in spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the conversions of Newman and other Tractarians of the 1840's and 1850's , the Catholic segment of England one hundred years ago was a very small one ( four per cent , or 800,000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public .</s>

<s>the return of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and , in fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty .</s>

<s>in 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers .</s>

<s>now , in 1961 , the Catholic population of England is still quite small ( ten per cent , or 5 million ) ;
yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population .</s>

<s>a Protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the Birmingham Oratory ( Catholic ) Church on Sunday mornings .</s>

<s>she found this a marvel because , as she said , only six per cent of English people are churchgoers .</s>

<s>she may not have been exact on this number , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten .</s>

<s>from many sides come remarks that Protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services .</s>

<s>a Catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city university , following Anglican evensong , at which there was a congregation of twelve , he celebrated Mass before more than a hundred .</s>

<s>the Protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches .</s>

<s>according to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church of England , the total of confirmed members is 9,748,000 , but only 2,887,671 are registered on the parochial church rolls , and over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church of England , but roughly only a tenth of them continue .</s>

<s>an amazing article in the Manchester Guardian of last November , entitled Fate Of Redundant Churches , states than an Archbishops' Commission reported last month that in the Church of England alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now , or will be in 20 years' time .</s>

<s>a further 260 Anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 .</s>

<s>and in the last five years , the Methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels .</s>

<s>most of these former churches are now used as warehouses , but neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman Catholics , and have done so .</s>

<s>while it must be said that these same Protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population shifts have emptied churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are going to church .</s>

<s>it should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics ( one paper writes 50 per cent ) .</s>

<s>still , it is clear from such reports , and apparently clear from the remarks of many people , that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing .</s>

<s>an Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true .</s>

<s>a century ago , Newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on English Protestantism , and that even high Anglicanism would someday no longer be a serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own .</s>

<s>that day is perhaps today , 1961 , and it seems no longer very meaningful to call England a Protestant country .</s>

<s>one of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians to unite .</s>

<s>many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy .</s>

<s>the London Universe devoted its centenary issue last December 8 to mapping out various aspects of Catholic progress during the last one hundred years .</s>

<s>with traditional nationalistic spirit , some Englishmen claim that English Catholicism is Catholicism at its best .</s>

<s>I have found myself saying with other foreigners here that English Catholics are good Catholics .</s>

<s>it has been my experience to find as many men as women in church , and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the Latin prayers and responses at Mass .</s>

<s>they hope , of course , to reclaim the non-Catholic population to the Catholic faith , and at every Sunday Benediction they recite by heart the Prayer for England : o Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of God and our most gentle queen and mother , look down in mercy upon England , thy dowry , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee .</s>

<s>intercede for our separated brethren , that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief Shepherd , the vicar of thy Son .</s>

<s>a hymn often to be heard in Catholic churches is Faith Of Our Fathers , which glories in England's ancient faith that endured persecution , and which proclaims : faith of our Fathers : Mary's prayers shall win our country back to thee .</s>

<s>the English saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the Forty Martyrs and Cardinal Newman will soon be canonized .</s>

<s>because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers , English Catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being un-English .</s>

<s>I have not seen this charge made during my stay here , but apparently it is still in the air .</s>

<s>for example , a writer in a recent number of the Queen hyperbolically states that of the myriad imprecations the only one which the English Catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are un-English .</s>

<s>in this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics , priests and laity , in England , while certainly seen as good for Catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics , especially when these Irishmen offer to remind their Christian brethren of this good .</s>

<s>one of the more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid-19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge Universities .</s>

<s>at Oxford one hundred years ago there were very few Catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 .</s>

<s>moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs .</s>

<s>now , not only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at Oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non-Catholic members of the University .</s>

<s>some Catholic priests lecture there ;
Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students .</s>

<s>further evidence that Roman Catholicism enjoys a more favorable position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to it in the mass media of England .</s>

<s>the general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester Guardian and the Sunday Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic Church is now at least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches .</s>

<s>on successive Sundays during October , 1960 , Paul Ferris ( a non-Catholic ) wrote articles in the Observer depicting clergymen of the Church of England , the Church of Rome and the Nonconformist Church .</s>

<s>the Catholic priest , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came out the best .</s>

<s>there were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman , who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as clergyman .</s>

<s>such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-Victorian England .</s>

<s>there was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on B.B.C.</s>

<s>, where comments were equally made by an Anglican parson , a Free Church minister and a Catholic priest .</s>

<s>Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs , sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen .</s>

<s>a notable example of this was the discussion of Christian unity by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool , Dr. Heenan , and the Anglican Archbishop of York , Dr. Ramsey , recently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury .</s>

<s>the good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well known in England .</s>

<s>the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months .</s>

<s>and it was interesting to observe that B.B.C.</s>

<s>'s television film on Christmas Eve was The Bells Of St. Mary's .</s>

<s>of course , the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of English religious history was the friendly visit paid by Dr. Fisher , then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury , to the Vatican last December .</s>

<s>it was the first time an English Primate has done this since the 14th century .</s>

<s>English Catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope .</s>

<s>almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England : statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants ;
news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit ;
a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters ;
the startling statement in a respectable periodical that Catholics , if the present system is still in operation , will constitute almost one-third of the House of Lords in the next generation ;
a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave .</s>

<s>the death of a man is unique , and yet it is universal .</s>

<s>the straight line would symbolize its uniqueness , the circle its universality .</s>

<s>but how can one figure symbolize both ?</s>

<s>Christianity declares that in the life and death of Jesus Christ the unique and the universal concur .</s>

<s>perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulated it as precisely , as Irenaeus .</s>

<s>to be the Savior and the Lord , Jesus Christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own ;
he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with man's history .</s>

<s>yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind .</s>

<s>his history is his alone , yet each man must recognize his own history in it .</s>

<s>his death is his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of Jesus .</s>

<s>each man can identify himself with the history and the death of Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ has identified himself with human history and human death , coming as the head of a new humanity .</s>

<s>not a circle , then , nor a straight line , but a spiral represents the shape of death as Irenaeus sees it ;
for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence .</s>

<s>as represented by a spiral , history may , in some sense , be said to repeat itself ;
yet each historical event remains unique .</s>

<s>Christ is both unique and universal .</s>

<s>the first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in Adam .</s>

<s>as Origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning , so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of Christ .</s>

<s>whence , then , comes the substance of the first man ?</s>

<s>from God's Will and Wisdom , and from virgin earth .</s>

<s>for God had not rained , says the Scripture , before man was made , and there was no man to till the earth .</s>

<s>from this earth , then , while it was still virgin God took dust and fashioned the man , the beginning of humanity .</s>

<s>Irenaeus does not regard Adam and Eve merely as private individuals , but as universal human beings , who were and are all of humanity .</s>

<s>Adam and Eve were perfect , not in the sense that they possessed perfection , but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection .</s>

<s>they were , in fact , children .</s>

<s>Irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for the human soul ;
therefore there is no need for him , as there is for Origen , to identify existence itself with the fall .</s>

<s>existence is created and willed by God and is not the consequence of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history .</s>

<s>historical existence is a created good .</s>

<s>the biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words : so God created man in his own image ;
in the similitude of God he created him .</s>

<s>there are some passages in the writings of Irenaeus where the image of God and the similitude are sharply distinguished , so most notably in the statement : if the ( Holy ) Spirit is absent from the soul , such a man is indeed of an animal nature ;
and , being left carnal , he will be an imperfect being , possessing the image ( of God ) in his formation , but not receiving the similitude ( of God ) through the Spirit .</s>

<s>thus the image of God is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster ;
the similitude of God , by contrast , is that which makes a man a child of God and not merely a rational creature .</s>

<s>recent research on Irenaeus , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction .</s>

<s>he does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall ;
for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as well as of mortality .</s>

<s>therefore Irenaeus describes man's creation as follows : so that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a law was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all .</s>

<s>and He laid down for him certain conditions : so that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that is , immortal ;
but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken .</s>

<s>these conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ;
yet he did not stop being human as a result .</s>

<s>there is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ) .</s>

<s>man was created with the capacity for immortality , but the devil's promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost Adam his immortality .</s>

<s>he was , in the words of Irenaeus , beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality .</s>

<s>the true way to immortality lay through obedience , but man did not believe this .</s>

<s>Eve was disobedient ;
for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin .</s>

<s>and even as she , having indeed a husband , Adam , but being nevertheless as yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human race ;
so also did Mary , having a man betrothed ( to her ) , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human race .</s>

<s>because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children , Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being due , no doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked .</s>

<s>his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary .</s>

<s>that parallelism affects his picture of man's disobedience too ;
for as it was Christ , the Word of God , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word of God in the beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe .</s>

<s>with this act of disobedience , and not with the inception of his individual existence , man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history , descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality .</s>

<s>at the nadir of that circuit is death .</s>

<s>along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death , because they did eat in disobedience ;
and disobedience to God entails death .</s>

<s>wherefore , as they became forfeit to death , from that ( moment ) they were handed over to it .</s>

<s>this leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that Adam and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed , namely , on a Friday , as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good Friday ;
he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath .</s>

<s>in any case , though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree , they obtained mortality instead .</s>

<s>the wages of sin is death .</s>

<s>man's life , originally shaped for immortality and for communion with God , must now be conformed to the shape of death .</s>

<s>nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to God , and he still rules .</s>

<s>even death , therefore , has a providential as well as a punitive function .</s>

<s>wherefore also He ( God ) drove him ( man ) out of Paradise , and removed him far from the tree of life , not because He envied him the tree of life , as some venture to assert , but because He pitied him , ( and did not desire ) that he should continue a sinner for ever , nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil interminable and irremediable .</s>

<s>but He set a bound to his ( state of ) sin , by interposing death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take place in the earth , so that man , ceasing at length to live in sin , and dying to it , might live to God .</s>

<s>this idea , which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus' theology ;
for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ .</s>

<s>as man can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life .</s>

<s>it is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is .</s>

<s>this applies to his picture of Adam .</s>

<s>it is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next .</s>

<s>it becomes most evident in his description of Christ as the second Adam , who does indeed come to destroy sin , but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality .</s>

<s>this emphasis upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the Greek-speaking ones .</s>

<s>they speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history .</s>

<s>death reminds man of his sin , but it reminds him also of his transience .</s>

<s>it represents a punishment that he knows he deserves , but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time .</s>

<s>these two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified .</s>

<s>the repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated .</s>

<s>such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older , in short , whether Adam's life was intended to be part of the process of time .</s>

<s>if it was , then it must have been God's intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity .</s>

<s>one night , so some of these theories run , Adam would have fallen asleep , much as he fell asleep for the creation of Eve ;
and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal .</s>

<s>the embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment , for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change .</s>

<s>on the other hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence .</s>

<s>it is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law .</s>

<s>if this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination , the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator .</s>

<s>this seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced .</s>

<s>if death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share , the gift of the life eternal through Christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e.</s>

<s>, created , existence .</s>

<s>such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of creation ;
for it teaches salvation from , not salvation in , time and history .</s>

<s>because Christianity teaches not only salvation in history , but salvation by the history of Christ , such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the Christian understanding of the work of Christ .</s>

<s>furthermore , as an encouragement to revisionist thinking , it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes .</s>

<s>the Unitarian clergy were an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen -- as the term was then understood in the Back Bay -- and Parker was definitely not a gentleman , either in theology or in manners .</s>

<s>Ezra Stiles Gannett , an honorable representative of the sanhedrin , addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845 , insisting that Parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist .</s>

<s>even so , Gannett judiciously argued , the Association could legitimately decide that Parker should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness .</s>

<s>we today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed Parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations .</s>

<s>one can even argue -- though this is a delicate matter -- that every justification existed for their returning the Public Lecture to the First Church , and so to suppress it , rather than let Parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it .</s>

<s>finally , it did seem clear as day to these clergymen , as Gannett's son explained in the biography of his father , they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title of Christians .</s>

<s>their demand against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow free inquiry to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a natural religion .</s>

<s>grant all this -- still , when modern Unitarianism and the Harvard Divinity School recall with humorous affection the insults Parker lavished upon them , or else argue that after all Parker received the treatment he invited , they betray an uneasy conscience .</s>

<s>whenever New England liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of Parker and the fraternity on January 23 , 1843 -- while it may defend the privilege of Chandler Robbins to demand that Parker leave the Association , while it may plead that Dr. N. L. Frothingham had every warrant for stating , the difference between Trinitarians and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity ;
the difference between Mr. Parker and the Association is a difference between no Christianity and Christianity -- despite these supposed conclusive assurances , the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief , of positive thanksgiving , that the Association never quite brought itself officially to expel Parker .</s>

<s>had it done so , the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible , nor could the Harvard Divinity School assemble today to honor Parker's insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying peccavi .</s>

<s>happily for posterity , then , the Boston Association did not actually command Parker to leave the room , though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality .</s>

<s>fortunately , the honor of the denomination can attest that Cyrus Bartol defended Parker's sincerity , as did also Gannett and Chandler Robbins ;
whereupon Parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room , though not out of the Fellowship .</s>

<s>in the hall , after adjournment , Dr. Frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested Parker to visit him -- whereupon our burly Theodore again burst into tears .</s>

<s>all this near tragedy , which to us borders on comedy , enables us to tell the story over and over again , always warming ourselves with a glow of complacency .</s>

<s>it was indeed a near thing , but somehow the inherent decency of New England ( which we inherit ) did triumph .</s>

<s>Parker was never excommunicated .</s>

<s>to the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled , we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it .</s>

<s>yet , even after all these stratagems , the conscience of Christian liberality is still not laid to rest , any more than is the conscience of Harvard University for having done the abject penance for its rejection of Ralph Waldo Emerson's The Divinity School Address of naming its hall of philosophy after him .</s>

<s>in both cases the stubborn fact remains : liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates , both legitimate offspring of its loins , and when brought to the test , it behaved shabbily .</s>

<s>suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel : is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences of opinion ?</s>

<s>is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about ?</s>

<s>however , there is a crucial difference between the two histories .</s>

<s>Emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside , or rather by leaving it behind him : he walked out of the Unitarian communion , so that it could lick the wound of his departure , preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration .</s>

<s>Parker insisted upon not resigning , even when the majority wanted him to depart , upon daring the Fellowship to throw him out .</s>

<s>hence he was in his lifetime , as is the memory of him afterwards , a canker within the liberal sensitivity .</s>

<s>he still points an accusing finger at all of us , telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat .</s>

<s>actually , the dispute between Parker and the society of his time , both ecclesiastical and social , was a real one , a bitter one .</s>

<s>it cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him .</s>

<s>the fact is incontestable : that liberal world of Unitarian Boston was narrow-minded , intellectually sterile , smug , afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm , and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened .</s>

<s>Parker , along with Garrison and Charles Sumner , showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs mobilized in defense of the Mexican War and slavery .</s>

<s>nevertheless , we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace ;
their passions were genuine , and the division between them and the abolitionists is clear-cut .</s>

<s>but Parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem , which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom .</s>

<s>even though his theological theses have become , to us , commonplaces , the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us .</s>

<s>it has been endlessly rephrased , but I may here put it thus : at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant ?</s>

<s>and then , as they become aware that they have reached the end of their patience , what do they , to their dismay , learn for the first time about themselves ?</s>

<s>there can be no doubt , the Boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior .</s>

<s>the gentle Channing , revered by all Bostonians , orthodox or Unitarian , wrote to a friend in Louisville that among its many virtues Boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit , that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action : no city in the world is governed so little by a police , and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment .</s>

<s>we stand more in awe of one another than most people .</s>

<s>opinion is less individual or runs more into masses , and often rules with a rod of iron .</s>

<s>even more poignantly , and with the insight of a genius , Channing added -- remember , this is Channing , not Parker ]
-- that should a minister in Boston trust himself to his heart , should he speak without book , and consequently break some law of speech , or be hurried into some daring hyperbole , he should find little mercy .</s>

<s>Channing wrote this -- in a letter ]
I think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons .</s>

<s>but Theodore Parker , commencing his mission to the world-at-large , disguised as the minister of a twenty-eighth Congregational Church which bore no resemblance to the Congregational polities descended from the founders ( among which were still the Unitarian churches ) , made explicit from the beginning that the conflict between him and the Hunkerish society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel difference about clerical decorum .</s>

<s>because he spoke openly with what Channing had prophesied someone might -- with daring hyperbole -- Parker vindicated Channing's further prophecy that he who committed this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines .</s>

<s>an institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution , and only within those defined limits a license .</s>

<s>by reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation , we should , I am sure , come to a fresh realization , however painful it be , that the battle between Parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest .</s>

<s>he arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with , at the least , resentment .</s>

<s>what otherwise could the lawyer , doctor , minister , the men of science and letters do when told that they had become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant , and continually cried , holy , holy , holy is the Almighty Dollar ?</s>

<s>nor , when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old Puritan stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration , should we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of rage as Parker snarled at them thus : talk about the Catholics voting as the bishop tells ]
reproach the Catholics for it ]
you and I do the same thing .</s>

<s>there are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom , nor a mitre on their head , who appeal not to the authority of the Pope at Rome , but to the Almighty Dollar , a pope much nearer home .</s>

<s>Boston has been controlled by a few capitalists , lawyers and other managers , who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think .</s>

<s>this was war .</s>

<s>Parker meant business .</s>

<s>and he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended them : even the Unitarian churches have caught the malaria , and are worse than those who deceived them -- which implied that they were very bad indeed .</s>

<s>it was duty he said that his parents had given him as a rule -- beyond even the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied -- and it was duty he would perform , though it cost him acute pain and exhausted him by the age of fifty .</s>

<s>Parker could weep -- and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation -- but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents .</s>

<s>if it gave me pleasure to say hard things , he wrote , I would shut up forever .</s>

<s>we have to tell ourselves that when Parker spoke in this vein , he believed what he said , because he could continue , but the truth , which cost me bitter tears to say , I must speak , though it cost other tears hotter than fire .</s>

<s>because he copiously shed his own tears , and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of New England , he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people's consciences .</s>

<s>our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very issue which in the Boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its Christian survival , that of the literal , factual historicity of the miracles as reported in the Four Gospels .</s>

<s>it is idle to ask why we are no longer disturbed if somebody , professing the deepest piety , decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not Christ transformed the water into wine at eleven A.M. on the third of August , A.D. 32 .</s>

<s>we have no answer as to why we are not alarmed .</s>

<s>so we are the more prepared to give Parker the credit for having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy , to salute his courage , and to pass on , happily forgetting both him and the entire episode .</s>

<s>we have not the leisure , or the patience , or the skill , to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the Harvard Divinity School who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor , the majesterial Andrews Norton , by saying that , while he believed Jesus like other religious teachers , worked miracles , I see not how a miracle proves a doctrine .</s>

<s>I have , within the past fifty years , come out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the Truth and about which I have not a shadow of doubt .</s>

<s>it has been my lot all through life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all questions , the nature of the hope of a life beyond this .</s>

<s>I have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science as well as in the religions in the world .</s>

<s>in an amateurish , yet in a very real sense , I have followed the developments of archaeology , geology , astronomy , herpetology , and mycology with a hearty appreciation of the advances being made in these fields .</s>

<s>at one time I became disturbed in the faith in which I had grown up by the apparent inroads being made upon both Old and New Testaments by a Higher Criticism of the Bible , to refute which I felt the need of a better knowledge of Hebrew and of archaeology , for it seemed to me that to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure .</s>

<s>doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while and , like some higher critical friends , trying to continue to use the Bible as the Word of God while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations : attempting to bridge the chasm between an older , reverent , Bible-loving generation and a critical , doubting , Bible-emancipated race .</s>

<s>although still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the Book , I stood outside shivering in the cold .</s>

<s>in one thing the higher critics , like the modernists , however , overreached themselves , in claiming that the Gospel of John was not written in John's time but well after the first century , perhaps as late as 150 A.D. .</s>

<s>now , if any part of the Bible is assuredly the very Word of God speaking through His servant , it is John's Gospel .</s>

<s>to ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some admiring follower , and was not inspired directly by the Spirit of God , is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the Bible .</s>

<s>here I took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path , to which we might give the modern name of Pragmatism , or the thing that works .</s>

<s>test it , try it , and if it works , accept it as a guiding principle .</s>

<s>so , I put my Bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself , and then tested it to see how it worked .</s>

<s>as a short , possibly not the best method , I looked up Word in the Concordance and noted that the Bible claims from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22 to be God's personal message to man .</s>

<s>the next traditional step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the Christian faith just as one would accept a treatise on any earthly science , and I submitted to its conditions according to Christ's invitation and promise that , if any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself ( John 7 : 17 ) .</s>

<s>the outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance of the Bible as the Word of God inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely human book , and with it the acceptance of our Lord Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God , Son of Man by the Virgin Mary , the Saviour of the world .</s>

<s>I believe , therefore , that we are without exception sinners , by nature alienated from God , and that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , came to earth , the representative Head of a new race , to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world , and that he who thus receives Christ as his personal Saviour is born again spiritually , with new privileges , appetites , and affections , destined to live and grow in His likeness forever .</s>

<s>nor can any man save himself by good works or by a commendable moral life , although such works are the natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally expressing itself through such avenues .</s>

<s>I now ever look for Christ according to His promises and those of the Old Testament as well , to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness over the whole earth .</s>

<s>to state fully what the Bible means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to formulate the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives and friends .</s>

<s>the Bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread is food for the body .</s>

<s>again , as faith reveals God my Father and Christ my Saviour , I follow without question where He leads me daily by His Spirit of love , wisdom , power and prayer .</s>

<s>I place His precepts and His leadings above every seeming probability , dismissing cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed to Him .</s>

<s>I discern no limits to a faith vested in God and Christ , who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge , and daring to trust Him even though called to stand alone before the world .</s>

<s>our Lord's invitation with its implied promise to all is , come and see .</s>

<s>I stood at the bedside of my patient one day and beheld a very sick man in terrible pain .</s>

<s>as I ministered to his needs , I noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and I learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also the Lord .</s>

<s>in his heart he had that peace of which the Lord spoke when He said , peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you .</s>

<s>let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .</s>

<s>what a joy to realize that we , too , can claim this promise tendered by the Lord during His earthly ministry to a group of men who were very dear to Him .</s>

<s>he was about to leave them , to depart from this world , and return to His Father in Heaven .</s>

<s>before He left them He promised that His peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts and minds .</s>

<s>I praise God for the privilege of being a nurse who has that peace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ .</s>

<s>it makes my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the Lord's guidance while ministering to the physical needs of my patients .</s>

<s>how often have I looked to Jesus when entering the sick room , asking for His presence and help in my professional duties as I give my talents not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the Saviour and His creatures .</s>

<s>looking unto God , the Prophet Isaiah wrote these blessed words almost three thousand years ago : thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee : because he trusteth in thee .</s>

<s>are you longing for peace in your heart ?</s>

<s>such a calm and assuring peace can be yours .</s>

<s>as only a member of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family , likewise one must belong to the family of God in order to receive the benefits that are promised to those who are His own .</s>

<s>perhaps you are not His child .</s>

<s>perhaps you do not know if you belong to Him .</s>

<s>you may know that you are in God's family and be just as sure of it as you are that you belong to the family of your earthly father .</s>

<s>God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life , and as many as received him , to them gave He power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on His name .</s>

<s>it is to those who believe on His name and belong to Him that He gives His peace ;
not that empty peace the world offers , but a deep , abiding peace which nothing can destroy .</s>

<s>why not open your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ now , accept Him as your Saviour and let Him fill you with peace that only He can give .</s>

<s>then , with the hymn writer of old , you can say : I am resting today in His wonderful peace , resting sweetly in Jesus' control .</s>

<s>( Psalm 27 : 1 ) a certain teacher scheduled a Fear Party for her fourth grade pupils .</s>

<s>it was a session at which all the youngsters were told to express their fears , to get them out in the open where they could talk about them freely .</s>

<s>the teacher thought it was so successful that she asks : wouldn't it be helpful to all age groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their fears and worries ?</s>

<s>Dr. George W. Crane , a medical columnist , thinks it would .</s>

<s>he says : that would reduce neurotic ailments tremendously .</s>

<s>each week an estimated 20 million patients call upon us doctors .</s>

<s>of this number , 50% , or 10 million patients have no diagnosable physical ailments whatever .</s>

<s>they are worry warts .</s>

<s>yet they keep running from one physician to another , largely to get a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles .</s>

<s>one of the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions .</s>

<s>we are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days .</s>

<s>it must be getting more serious .</s>

<s>people are giving their doctors a hard time .</s>

<s>one doctor made a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles , and he reported that 40% of them worried about things that never happened ;
30% of them worried about past happenings which were completely beyond their control ;
12% of them worried about their health , although their ailments were imaginary ;
10% of them worried about their friends , neighbors , and relatives , most of whom were quite capable of taking care of themselves .</s>

<s>only 8% of the worries had behind them real causes which demanded attention .</s>

<s>well , most of our fears may be unfounded , but after you discover that fact , you have something else to worry about : why then do we have these fears ?</s>

<s>what is the real cause of them ?</s>

<s>what is there about us that makes us so anxious ?</s>

<s>look at the things we do to escape our fears and to forget our worries .</s>

<s>we spend millions of dollars every year on fortune tellers and soothsayers .</s>

<s>we spend billions of dollars at the race tracks , and more billions on other forms of gambling .</s>

<s>we spend billions of dollars on liquor , and many more billions on various forms of escapist entertainment .</s>

<s>we consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers and sleeping pills in order to get a moment's relief from the tensions that are tearing us apart .</s>

<s>a visitor from a more peaceful country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement parks , and after he had seen it all , he said to a friend : you must be a very sad people .</s>

<s>sad was not the right word , of course .</s>

<s>he should have said jittery , for that's what we are .</s>

<s>and that's worse than sad .</s>

<s>watch people flock to amusement houses , cocktail lounges , and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment , which means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of dubious relaxation -- watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something .</s>

<s>in one of his writings Pascal speaks of this mania for diversion as being a sign of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates .</s>

<s>yes , and as tension mounts in this world , fear is increasing .</s>

<s>does that explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business ?</s>

<s>we have so many new things to fear in this age of nuclear weapons , dreadful things which are too horrible to contemplate .</s>

<s>I doubt that fear parties and group confessionals will help very much .</s>

<s>suppose we do get our fears out in the open , what then ?</s>

<s>isn't that where most of them are already -- right out on the front page of our newspapers ?</s>

<s>maybe we are talking about them too much .</s>

<s>the question is : what are we going to do about them ?</s>

<s>meanwhile , the enemy will capitalize on our fears , if he can .</s>

<s>Hitler did just that 23 years ago , building up tensions that first led to a Munich and then to a world war .</s>

<s>the fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to compromise , or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate .</s>

<s>it is said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals to attack .</s>

<s>it could have the same effect on Communists .</s>

<s>the President of the United States has said : we will never negotiate out of fear , and we will never fear to negotiate .</s>

<s>that is a sound position , but it is important that Moscow shall recognize it not merely as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not afraid .</s>

<s>and that's another reason why it is imperative for us these days to conquer our fears , to develop the poise that promotes peace .</s>

<s>turning to the Word of God , we find the only sure way to do that .</s>

<s>in Psalm 27 : 1 you read those beautiful words which you must have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you , or to drive them out if they have you in their grip : the Lord is my light and my salvation ;
whom shall I fear ?</s>

<s>the Lord is the strength of my life ;
of whom shall I be afraid ?</s>

<s>well , you say , those are beautiful words all right , but it was easy for the psalmist to sing them in his day .</s>

<s>he didn't live in a world of perpetual peril like ours .</s>

<s>he didn't know anything about the problems we face today .</s>

<s>no ?</s>

<s>read the next two verses : when the wicked , even mine enemies and my foes , came upon me to eat up my flesh , they stumbled and fell .</s>

<s>though an host should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear : though war should rise against me , in this will I be confident .</s>

<s>that is almost a perfect description of the predicament in which we find ourselves today , isn't it ?</s>

<s>our enemy is also threatening to devour us .</s>

<s>he has already devoured huge areas of the world , putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains and barbed wire , reducing them to slavery , systematically crushing not only their bodies but their souls , and shooting them to death if they try to escape their prison .</s>

<s>yes indeed , we too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against us .</s>

<s>what a terrible thing , that wailing wall in Berlin ]
a man with a baby in his arms stood there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest of the family .</s>

<s>another man tried to swim across the river from the East to the West , but was shot and killed .</s>

<s>a middle aged woman opened a window on the third floor of her house which was behind the wall , she threw out a few belongings and then jumped ;
she was fatally injured .</s>

<s>the entrance to a church has been walled up , so that the congregation , most of which is in the western sector , cannot worship God there anymore .</s>

<s>practically everybody in Berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city .</s>

<s>people stand at the wall giving vent to their feelings , weeping , pounding it with their fists , pleading for loved ones .</s>

<s>but the enemy answers them from loudspeakers that pour out Communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible profanity .</s>

<s>there is only one escape left , a tragic one , and too many people are taking it : suicide .</s>

<s>the normal rate of suicides in East Berlin was one a day , but since the border was closed on August 13 it has jumped to 25 a day ]
these things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next door .</s>

<s>we are all involved in them , deeply involved .</s>

<s>and nobody knows what comes next .</s>

<s>we live from crisis to crisis .</s>

<s>and there is only one way for a man to conquer his fears in such a world .</s>

<s>he must learn to say with true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world : the Lord is my light and my salvation ;
whom shall I fear ?</s>

<s>the Lord is the strength of my life ;
of whom shall I be afraid ?</s>

<s>notice that this man had a threefold conception of God which is the secret of his faith .</s>

<s>first , the Lord is my light .</s>

<s>he lived in a very dark world , but he was not in the dark .</s>

<s>the same God who called this world into being when He said : let there be light ]
-- those were His very first creative words -- He began the world with light -- this God still gives light to a world which man has plunged into darkness .</s>

<s>for those who put their trust in Him He still says every day again : let there be light ]
and there is light ]
in fact , He came into this world Himself , in the person of His Son , Jesus Christ , who stood here amid the darkness of human sin and said : I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life .</s>

<s>the psalmist could say that God was his light even though he could only anticipate the coming of Christ .</s>

<s>he lived in the dawn ;
he could only see the light coming over the horizon .</s>

<s>we live in the bright daylight of that great event ;
for us it is a fact in history .</s>

<s>why should we not have the same faith , and an even greater experience of the light which it gives ?</s>

<s>this is the faith that moved the psalmist to add his second conception of God : the Lord is my salvation .</s>

<s>he knew that his God would save him from his enemies because He had saved him from his sins .</s>

<s>if God could do that , He could do anything .</s>

<s>the enemies at his gate , threatening to eat up his flesh , were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul .</s>

<s>and God had conquered that one by His grace ]
so why worry about all the others ?</s>

<s>the apostle Paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the New Testament : He that spared not His own Son , but delivered Him up for us all , how shall He not with Him freely give us all things ?</s>

<s>if God be for us , who can be against us ?</s>

<s>who shall separate us from the love of Christ ?</s>

<s>shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?</s>

<s>( Romans 31 , 32 , 35 ) salvation ]
this is the key to the conquest of fear .</s>

<s>this gets down to the heart of our problem , for it reconciles us with God , whom we fear most of all because we have sinned against Him .</s>

<s>when that fear has been removed by faith in Jesus Christ , when we know that He is our Savior , that He has paid our debt with His blood , that He has met the demands of God's justice and thus has turned His wrath away -- when we know that , we have peace with God in our hearts ;
and then , with this God on our side , we can face the whole world without fear .</s>

<s>and so the psalmist gives us one more picture of God : the Lord is the strength of my life .</s>

<s>the word is really stronghold .</s>

<s>it recalls those words of another psalm : God is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .</s>

<s>therefore will not we fear , though the earth be removed , and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea come , behold the works of the Lord , what desolations He hath made in the earth .</s>

<s>but , again , we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century A.D. , when an Arabic scholar , Tabit Ibn Korra ( 836-901 ) is said to have discussed the magic square of three .</s>

<s>thus , while it remains possible that the Babylonians and/or the Pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the Chinese did , more definite evidence will have to turn up from the Middle East or the Classical World before China can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>the Lo Shu square as an expression of centrality
the concept of the Middle Kingdom at peace , strong and united under a forceful ruler , which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of the Warring States , was finally realized by the establishment of a Chinese Empire under the Ch'in dynasty ( 221-207 B.C. )</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>but this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism .</s>

<s>among the many severe measures taken by the First Emperor , Shih Huang-ti , in his efforts to insure the continuation of this hard-won national unity , was the burning of the books in 213 B.C.</s>

<s>, with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for divergent thinking ;
but , as he had a special fondness for magic and divination , he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared .</s>

<s>many of the latter were destroyed in their turn , during the burning of the vast Ch'in palace some ten years later ;
yet some must have survived , because the old interest in number symbolism , divination , and magic persisted on into the Han dynasty , which succeeded in reuniting China and keeping it together for a longer period ( from 202 B.C.</s>

<s>to A.D. 220 ) .</s>

<s>in fact , during the first century B.C.</s>

<s>, an extensive literature sprang up devoted to these subjects , finding its typical expression in the so-called wei books , a number of which were specifically devoted to the Lo Shu and related numerical diagrams , especially in connection with divination .</s>

<s>however , the wei books were also destroyed in a series of Orthodox Confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in 605 .</s>

<s>after all this destruction of old literature , it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the Lo Shu , which was already semisecret anyhow .</s>

<s>but , in spite of all this , enough evidence remains to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object of a rather extensive cult -- or series of cults -- reaching fullest expression in the Han period .</s>

<s>although modern scholars have expressed surprise that the simple magic square of three , a mere mathematical puzzle , was able to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured Chinese for so many centuries , they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself .</s>

<s>but , up to now , no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties , or the numerical significance of its numbers -- singly or in combination -- and then tried to consider these in the light of Old Chinese cosmological concepts .</s>

<s>such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle number of the Lo Shu , 5 , was so vitally significant for the Chinese ever since the earliest hints that they had a knowledge of this diagram .</s>

<s>the importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers -- quite apart from any numerological considerations , which is to say , any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it .</s>

<s>indeed , mathematically speaking , it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram .</s>

<s>if one takes the middle number , 5 , and multiplies it by 3 ( the base number of the magic square of three ) , the result is 15 , which is also the constant sum of all the rows , columns , and two main diagonals .</s>

<s>then , if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square , through multiplying it by the highest number , 9 ( which is the square of the base number ) , the result is 45 ;
and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square , by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed .</s>

<s>furthermore , the middle number of the Lo Shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers , by reason of its central position ;
it is also their mathematical mean , since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair , all of which equal 10 .</s>

<s>in fact , the neat balance of these pairs , and their subtle equilibrium , would have had special meaning in the minds of the Old Chinese .</s>

<s>for they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female , equating the two groups with the Yang and Yin principles in Nature ;
and in this square , the respective pairs made up of large and small odd ( Yang ) numbers , and those composed of large and small even ( Yin ) numbers , were all equal to each other .</s>

<s>thus all differences were leveled , and all contrasts erased , in a realm of no distinction , and the harmonious balance of the Lo Shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis .</s>

<s>the tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the Lo Shu square -- for purely mathematical reasons -- and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe , could well explain why the Old Chinese seem to have so revered the number 5 , and why they put so much stress on the concept of Centrality .</s>

<s>these twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the Han dynasty .</s>

<s>the existing reverence for Centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century B.C.</s>

<s>, when the Han Emperor Wu Ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow -- which symbolized the Center among the traditional Five Directions -- and took 5 as the dynastic number , believing that he would thus place himself , his imperial family , and the nation under the most auspicious influences .</s>

<s>his immediate motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired by the Lo Shu , but this measure must inevitably have increased the existing beliefs in the latter's efficacy .</s>

<s>after this time , inscriptions on the Han bronze mirrors , as well as other writings , emphasized the desirability of keeping one's self at the center of the universe , where cosmic forces were strongest .</s>

<s>later , we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally .</s>

<s>all this emphasis on Centrality and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the Center , which seems to have begun as far back as 400 B.C.</s>

<s>, also may conceivably have led to the development of the Five-Elements School and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five .</s>

<s>we find , for example , such groupings as the Five Ancient Rulers , the Five Sacred Mountains , the Five Directions ( with Center ) , the Five Metals , Five Colors , Five Tastes , Five Odors , Five Musical Notes , Five Bodily Functions , Five Viscera , and many others .</s>

<s>this trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the Five Elements itself , as though they had served as the base for all the rest ;
but why did the Old Chinese postulate five elements , when the Ancient Near East -- which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence in human life and activities -- recognized only four ?</s>

<s>and why did the Chinese suddenly begin to talk about the Five Directions , when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four ?</s>

<s>obviously , something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives , and that may have been the workings of the Lo Shu .</s>

<s>this whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on Chinese thinking .</s>

<s>whereas the primary meanings of the Lo Shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties -- and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases -- the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers , until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded Chinese thought .</s>

<s>scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in Nature , or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things , in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical , and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in China for many centuries .</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>Yin and Yang in the Lo Shu square
although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the Lo Shu , and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it , might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the Lo Shu held for the Old Chinese philosophers , this was actually only a beginning of wonders .</s>

<s>for the Lo Shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time .</s>

<s>as such , one cannot fully understand the thought of the pre-Han and Han periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the Lo Shu but , conversely , one cannot begin to understand the Lo Shu without knowing something about the world view of the Old Chinese , which they felt they saw expressed in it .</s>

<s>the Chinese world view during the Han dynasty , when the Lo Shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity , was based in large part on the teachings of the Yin-Yang and Five-Elements School , which was traditionally founded by Tsou Yen .</s>

<s>according to this doctrine , the universe was ruled by Heaven , T'ien -- as a natural force , or in the personification of a Supreme Sky-god -- governing all things by means of a process called the Tao , which can be roughly interpreted as the Order of the Universe or the Universal Way .</s>

<s>Heaven , acting through the Tao , expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles , the Yin and the Yang .</s>

<s>the Yang , or male principle , was the source of light , heat , and dynamic vitality , associated with the Sun ;
while the Yin , or female principle , flourished in darkness , cold , and quiet inactivity , and was associated with the Moon .</s>

<s>together these two principles influenced all things , and in varying combinations they were present in everything .</s>

<s>we have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being Yang , while the even numbers were Yin , so that the eight outer numbers of the Lo Shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center .</s>

<s>during the Han dynasty , another Yin-Yang conception was applied to the Lo Shu , considering the latter as a plan of Ancient China .</s>

<s>instead of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional Nine Provinces , as was usually done , this equated the odd , Yang numbers with mountains ( firm and resistant , hence Yang ) and the even numbers with rivers ( sinuous and yielding , hence Yin ) ;
taking the former from the Five Sacred Mountains of the Han period and the latter from the principal river systems of Old China .</s>

<s>thus the middle number , 5 , represented Sung-Shan in Honan , Central China ;
the 3 , T'ai-Shan in Shantung , East China ;
the 7 , Hwa-Shan in Shensi , West China ;
the 1 , Heng-Shan in Hopei , North China ( or the mountain with the same name in neighboring Shansi ) ;
and the 9 , Huo-Shan in Anhwei , which was then the South Sacred Mountain .</s>

<s>for the rivers , the 4 represented the Huai , to the ( then ) Southeast ;
the 2 , the San Kiang ( three rivers ) in the ( then ) Southwest ;
the 8 , the Chi in the Northeast ;
and the 6 , the ( upper ) Yellow River in the Northwest .</s>

<s>note that by Western standards this plan was upside down , as it put North at the bottom and South at the top , with the other directions correspondingly altered ;
but in this respect it was merely following the accepted Chinese convention for all maps .</s>

<s>the same arrangement was used when the Lo Shu was equated with the Nine Provinces ;
and whenever the Lo Shu involved directional symbolism , it was oriented in this same fashion .</s>

<s>few persons who join the Church are insincere .</s>

<s>they earnestly desire to do the will of God .</s>

<s>when they fall by the wayside and fail to achieve Christian stature , it is an indictment of the Church .</s>

<s>these fatalities are dramatic evidence of halfway evangelism , a failure to follow through .</s>

<s>a program of Lay Visitation Evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship .</s>

<s>the work of Lay Visitation Evangelism is not completed when all of the persons on the Responsibility List have been interviewed .</s>

<s>in the average situation about one-third of those visited make commitments to Christ and the Church .</s>

<s>the pastor and the Membership Preparation and Assimilation Committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program .</s>

<s>the first thirty to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine their interest and participation in the life of the Church .</s>

<s>neglect means spiritual paralysis or death .</s>

<s>preparation for membership

<s>it is important that persons desiring to unite with the Church be prepared for this experience so that it may be meaningful and spiritually significant .</s>

<s>it is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of Church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications .</s>

<s>preparation for Church membership begins immediately after the commitment is received .</s>

<s>1

<s>none should ask less .</s>

<s>they will have a greater appreciation for the Church and a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something of them .</s>

<s>many churches find the Sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes .</s>

<s>others meet on Sunday night , at the mid-week service , or for a series of four nights .</s>

<s>some pastors have two sessions in one evening , with a refreshment period between .</s>

<s>the sessions should cover four major areas : A -- the Christian Faith ;
B -- history of the Church ;

<s>the following have been found effective .</s>

<s>1 )

<s>some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each , generally held on Sunday night or during the week .</s>

<s>this gives greater opportunity for the learning process .</s>

<s>10 )

<s>11 )

<s>what about transfers ?</s>

<s>there is a growing conviction among pastors and Church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the Church need preparatory training , including those coming by transfer of membership .</s>

<s>George E. Sweazey writes : there is danger in trying to make admission to the Church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know that anything has happened .</s>

<s>people appreciate experiences that demand something of them .</s>

<s>those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule .</s>

<s>for most of them , it will be their first experience in membership training , since this is a recent development in many churches .</s>

<s>those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed .</s>

<s>the preparatory class is an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted with one another .</s>

<s>it provides a natural transition into the life of the local church and its organizations .</s>

<s>reception into the Church Fellowship
the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo when the group of new members stands before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the Church .</s>

<s>this should be a high moment in their lives , a never-to-be-forgotten experience .</s>

<s>they should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to Christ our Lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages .</s>

<s>every detail of the service merits careful attention -- the hymns , the sermon , the ritual , the right hand of fellowship , the introduction to the congregation , the welcome of the congregation .</s>

<s>this is a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation .</s>

<s>it will help to determine the attitude of the new members toward the Church .</s>

<s>it can mean the difference between participation and inaction , spiritual growth and decay .</s>

<s>the worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the Church .</s>

<s>the atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience .</s>

<s>psychologically the reception should be the climax , following the sermon .</s>

<s>1 )
ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete talent sheets and pledge cards .</s>

<s>some denominations ask new members to sign personally the chronological membership register .</s>

<s>provide a name card for each new member .</s>

<s>outline plans for the entire service .</s>

<s>yet the most difficult problem in the Church's program of evangelism is right at this point -- helping new members to become participating , growing parts of the fellowship .</s>

<s>during this period 7,484,268 members were received , yet the net membership now is only 9,910,741 .</s>

<s>these figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership .</s>

<s>this problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship .</s>

<s>studies of membership trends , even in some areas where population is expanding , show that numbers of churches have had little net increase , though many new members were received .</s>

<s>something is wrong when these things happen .</s>

<s>the local family of God has failed its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare .</s>

<s>basic needs
new members can become participating , growing members .</s>

<s>but this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life .</s>

<s>it must be planned and carefully developed .</s>

<s>the entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process .</s>

<s>if the church has followed the plan of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership preparation as outlined earlier in this book , the process of assimilation and growth will be well under way .</s>

<s>those who enter the front door of the church intelligently and with Christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest .</s>

<s>however , it is not enough to bring persons to Christian commitment and train them in the meaning of Christian discipleship .</s>

<s>when they unite with the Church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective Christians .</s>

<s>the Church expects certain things of those who become members .</s>

<s>the new members justifiably expect some things from their church family : welcome into the fellowship -- sincere Christian love and understanding -- inspiring and challenging worship experiences -- social and recreational activities -- opportunities for Christian service -- opportunities for study of the Christian faith and the Bible -- creative prayer experiences -- guidance in Christian social concerns .</s>

<s>men need unity and they need God .</s>

<s>care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor God with our parochial ideas about him , but with these two qualifications , the statement stands .</s>

<s>the statement also points to a classic paradox : the more men turn toward God , who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established , the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another .</s>

<s>to be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones , with a resultant fragmentation of the human race .</s>

<s>massacres attending the partition of India and the establishment of the State of Israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender .</s>

<s>the words of Cardinal Newman come forcibly to mind : oh how we hate one another for the love of God ]
the source of this paradox is not difficult to identify .</s>

<s>it lies in institutions .</s>

<s>institutions require structure , form , and definition , and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion .</s>

<s>a completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms ;
to escape this fate , it must rule some things out .</s>

<s>for every criterion which defines what something is , at the same time proclaims -- implicitly if not openly -- what that something is not .</s>

<s>some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether ;
in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification , we ought to dispense with churches .</s>

<s>the suggestion is naive .</s>

<s>man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being .</s>

<s>having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile , he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance .</s>

<s>to propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools .</s>

<s>both eventualities are possible logically , but practically they are impossible .</s>

<s>as much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in God , they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him .</s>

<s>yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows .</s>

<s>is there any way out of the predicament ?</s>

<s>the only way that I can see is through communication .</s>

<s>interfaith communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries .</s>

<s>approached creatively , it is a high art .</s>

<s>it is the art of relating the finite to the infinite , of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart God's intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary .</s>

<s>in a certain sense , interfaith communication parallels diplomatic communication among the nation-states .</s>

<s>what are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history ?</s>

<s>I shall touch on three areas : personal , national , and theological .</s>

<s>1 )
by personal factors I mean those rooted in personality structure .</s>

<s>some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all , but by the need of men to have persons they can blame , distrust , denounce , and even hate .</s>

<s>such needs may rise to pathological proportions .</s>

<s>modern psychology has shown that paralleling the authoritarian personality is the bigoted personality in which insecurity , inferiority , suspicion , and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally .</s>

<s>fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears to be quite small , but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the rest of us .</s>

<s>to some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us .</s>

<s>interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all , for they have no redeeming features whatsoever .</s>

<s>it is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they , rather than pretexts for them , that are causing the trouble , and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies .</s>

<s>2 )
while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial , nationalism is more variable .</s>

<s>the specific instance I have in mind is the Afro-Asian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century .</s>

<s>emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination , the Afro-Asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires .</s>

<s>no less than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence since World War 2 , and the number is growing by the year .</s>

<s>as an obvious consequence , obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area : relations between Christians and non-Christians in these lands .</s>

<s>colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious , for Christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other .</s>

<s>actually , however , this turns out to be only part of the picture .</s>

<s>nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones , some of which had been lying in slumber for centuries .</s>

<s>the truth is that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and Volksgeist which these young nations very much need .</s>

<s>insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate , trans-political justifications for their existence , such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone else's .</s>

<s>all this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural communication for which Christian missions stand .</s>

<s>Africans and Asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of Western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda .</s>

<s>the people hardest hit by this suspicion are , of course , Christians on the mainland of China .</s>

<s>but the problem extends elsewhere .</s>

<s>for example , in Burma and Ceylon many Buddhists argue that Buddhism ought to be the official state religion .</s>

<s>in 1960 Ceylon nationalized its sectarian -- preponderantly Christian -- schools , to the rejoicing of most of its 7,000,000 Buddhists and the lament of its 800,000 Roman Catholics .</s>

<s>again , India has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries , and fanatical Hindu parties are expected to seek further action against Christians once the influence making for tolerance due to Nehru and his followers is gone .</s>

<s>the progressive closing of Afro-Asian ears to the Christian message is epitomized in a conversation I had three years ago while flying from Jerusalem to Cairo .</s>

<s>I was seated next to the director of the Seventh Day Adventists' world radio program .</s>

<s>he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on Japanese radio networks , but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them .</s>

<s>after returning to the United States and raising the money , he discovered on getting back to Japan that the hours were no longer available .</s>

<s>it was not that they had been contracted for during the interval ;
they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes .</s>

<s>it is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of anti-Christian sentiment .</s>

<s>ironically , these are the groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since World War 2 , while the more established denominations are barely maintaining pre-war staffs .</s>

<s>although I have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between Christians and non-Christians in Asia , the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain Afro-Asian religions themselves .</s>

<s>the partition of India has hardly improved relations between Hindus and Muslims ;
neither has the establishment of the State of Israel fostered harmony between Muslims and Jews .</s>

<s>3 )
I turn finally to several theological developments .</s>

<s>1 .</s>

<s>theocracy reconsidered .</s>

<s>the modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state , whatever its political form .</s>

<s>the American Constitution was historic at this point in providing that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .</s>

<s>one of our foremost jurists , David Dudley Field , has gone so far as to call this provision the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history .</s>

<s>the trend throughout the world's religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional enactment .</s>

<s>Pakistan was created in 1947 expressly as a Muslim state , but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of Islam for the modern political situation .</s>

<s>what is the point , Charles Adams reports the Pakistanis as asking , in demanding an Islamic state and society if no one , not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves , can say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is ?</s>

<s>the current regime of President Mohammad Ayub Khan is determinedly secular .</s>

<s>and while the nation was formerly named The Islamic Republic of Pakistan , it is now simply The Republic of Pakistan .</s>

<s>comparable trends can be noted elsewhere .</s>

<s>the new regime in Turkey is intentionally less Muslim than its predecessor .</s>

<s>the religious parties in Israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months .</s>

<s>during the years when Israel was passing from crisis to crisis -- the Sinai campaign , the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants -- it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties .</s>

<s>now that Israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions , the secularists are less disposed to compromise .</s>

<s>and in this country Gustave Weigel's delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive Roman Catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state .</s>

<s>the failure at that time of the Puerto Rican bishops to control the votes of their people added a ring of good sense to Father Weigel's theological argument .</s>

<s>everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible -- in a word , too human -- to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>salvation reconsidered .</s>

<s>my father went as a missionary to China in a generation that responded to Student Volunteer Movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many Chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them .</s>

<s>that mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed .</s>

<s>I do not mean to imply that Christians have adopted the liberal assumption , so prevalent in Hinduism , that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit .</s>

<s>Leslie Newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the World Council of Churches when he says , we must claim absoluteness and finality for Christ and His finished work , but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it .</s>

<s>Newbiggin's qualification on the Christian claim is of considerable significance .</s>

<s>the Roman Catholic Church has excommunicated one of its priests , Father Feeney , for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church .</s>

<s>in mentioning this under salvation reconsidered I do not mean to imply that Roman Catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is .</s>

<s>when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to permit the termination of the human race by human action , because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing , they know exactly what they mean .</s>

<s>of course , in prudential calculation , in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done , no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows .</s>

<s>yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great , or evil repelled sufficiently grave , to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action .</s>

<s>I mean , however , that the moral theologian knows what he means by permit .</s>

<s>he is not talking in the main about probabilities , risks and danger in general .</s>

<s>he is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing ( and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result ) as it efficaciously does some good .</s>

<s>he is talking about double effects , of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other , but causes both ;
of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended , but still both are done , while the evil effect is , with equal consciousness on the part of the agent , foreknown to be among the consequences .</s>

<s>this is what , in a technical sense , to only permit an evil result means .</s>

<s>it means to do it and to know one is doing it , but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends .</s>

<s>of course , grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military action of any nation , or to the action of any leader or leaders , which for any supposed good permits , in this sense , the termination of the human race by human action .</s>

<s>certainly , in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives , it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds , and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative .</s>

<s>naturally , where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain , this has to be taken into account .</s>

<s>especially is this true when , because the good effect is remote and speculative while the evil is certain and grave , the action is prohibited .</s>

<s>presumably , if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming , not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate , but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account .</s>

<s>there must not only be greater good than evil objectively in view , but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm .</s>

<s>if an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for by a problematic , speculative , future good , by the same token not every present , certain , and immediate good ( or lesser evil ) that may have to be done will be outweighed by a problematic , speculative , and future evil .</s>

<s>nevertheless , according to the traditional theory , a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences .</s>

<s>he does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action .</s>

<s>above all , he does not debate mere contingencies , and therefore , if these are possibly dreadful , find himself forced into inaction .</s>

<s>he does what he can and may and must , without regarding himself as lord of the future or , on the other hand , as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not permit in the sense explained .</s>

<s>by contrast , a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities , and not with the moral nature of the action to be done ;
and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result , whether by anyone's doing or by accident , it finds itself driven to inaction , to non-political action in politics and non-military action in military affairs , and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based .</s>

<s>Mr. Philip Toynbee writes , for example , that in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues .</s>

<s>if it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin .</s>

<s>against such a termination of human life on earth by human action , he then proposes as an alternative that we negotiate at once with the Russians and get the best terms which are available , that we deliberately negotiate from comparative weakness .</s>

<s>he bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically , i.e.</s>

<s>, by considering the worst possible outcome , namely , the total domination of the world by Russia within a few years .</s>

<s>this would be by far the better choice , when it is a question of allowing the human race to survive , possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us detest , or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish .</s>

<s>nevertheless , the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified : it is a possible result , however improbable ;
the worst , and least probable result ;
if it didn't prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing ;
for surely anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war .</s>

<s>if we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms , then we need to submit ourselves to the following simple test : have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are ?</s>

<s>thus , moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality ;
it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself , its intention , and proximate effect or the thing to be done .</s>

<s>several of the replies to Mr. Toynbee , without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil , succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made , by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil .</s>

<s>it is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation .</s>

<s>I am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of race suicide by accident rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design .</s>

<s>but I can only make this choice because I believe that the risk need not increase , but may be deliberately reduced ( by precautions against accidents or by limiting war ?
)</s>

<s>quoting Mr. Kennan's phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war , he ( Toynbee ) says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war .</s>

<s>if asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility , most men will choose the latter .</s>

<s>if Philip Toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war , I think he is right .</s>

<s>I do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war .</s>

<s>even Professor Arnold Toynbee , agreeing with his son , does so in these terms : compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race , all other evils are lesser evils .</s>

<s>let us therefore put first things first , and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be .</s>

<s>Mr. Philip Toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four , if he believed Communism was not only evil but also irredeemably evil , then he might think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world .</s>

<s>even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the earth until doomsday .</s>

<s>no political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature .</s>

<s>but one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense , or a static order in which no changes will take place in time , to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact : there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force .</s>

<s>on their way to the Heavenly City the children of God make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation .</s>

<s>not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment , but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand .</s>

<s>Toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment .</s>

<s>I would far rather die after a Russian occupation of this country -- by some deliberate act of refusal -- than die uselessly by atomisation .</s>

<s>would such an act of refusal be useful ?</s>

<s>he does not mean , in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition , that if we took the risk of surrendering , a new generation in Britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender .</s>

<s>he wants to be brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless -- far , far more hopeless than was the Hungarian revolution of 1956 .</s>

<s>this is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war , by creating a monopoly in one power of the world's arsenal of unlimited weapons .</s>

<s>it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it , or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it , in the past .</s>

<s>it is no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples .</s>

<s>hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop .</s>

<s>this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted , to the very last ;
it is to stride along the steep slope downward .</s>

<s>the only contrary action , in the future as in the past , runs the risk of war ;
and , now and in the future unlike in the past , any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will , by human action , render this planet less habitable by the human race .</s>

<s>that is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to permitted effects , and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated , or not directly morally related , to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures .</s>

<s>finally , just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth , but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination , the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing , by human action , to accelerate this end .</s>

<s>we should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know not what future .</s>

<s>much more than shelter , housing symbolizes social status , a sense of belonging , acceptance within a given group or neighborhood , identification with particular cultural values and social institutions , feelings of pride and worth , aspirations and hopes basic to human well-being .</s>

<s>for almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as self-evident by most Americans .</s>

<s>few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders .</s>

<s>this pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics ;
it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country .</s>

<s>it is not surprising that , as spokesman for real estate interests , the National Association of Real Estate Boards ( NAREB ) and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure .</s>

<s>how does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race , religion or ethnic attachment ?</s>

<s>what does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest ?</s>

<s>what ought to be , what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change ?</s>

<s>what social , ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation ?</s>

<s>recently , a group of the faculty at Wesleyan University's Public Affairs Center sought some answers to these questions .</s>

<s>several New England realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers , political scientists , economists , social psychologists , social ethicists and theologians .</s>

<s>here , in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism , each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it .</s>

<s>for a number of years , Wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body , attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy .</s>

<s>this article presents our observations of that session , of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them .</s>

<s>such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most realtors .</s>

<s>within the membership of this group , as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations , the most ready portrayal of oneself to the public is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them .</s>

<s>professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner .</s>

<s>but as conversation goes on , particularly among the realtors themselves , another image emerges , that of considerable power and influence in the community .</s>

<s>obviously , much more than customer expectation is determining the realtor's role .</s>

<s>judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers' income , educational level and above all , racial extraction ;
and whether these would qualify them for congenial , happy relations to other people in certain community areas .</s>

<s>a narrow professionalism
how explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of J Code of Ethics Article 34 in the Code , adopted in 1924 , states that a Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy , members of any race or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood .</s>

<s>though the reference to race was stricken by the association in 1950 , being an agent of such detrimental influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid .</s>

<s>the rationale for this avoidance was most frequently expressed in economic terms ;
all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white , particularly Negro , peoples into all-white , restricted areas .</s>

<s>they would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate professionals but agitators for some kind of cause or reform , and this was no longer to be a pro .</s>

<s>obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of professional with narrow skills and specialization , the effective servicing of a client , rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one's work .</s>

<s>these men -- for the most part educated in our best New England colleges , well established financially and socially in the community -- under kindly but insistent probing , reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve , or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a client-service relationship .</s>

<s>this narrow professionalism does not even fit the present realities of their situation , as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase .</s>

<s>as our discussion continued , the inadequacy of the client relationship as an interpretation of their way of operating became evident .</s>

<s>realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work , as members of social and professional organizations , as citizens and civic leaders , as church laymen , as university alumni , as newspaper readers , etc.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>from such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding .</s>

<s>it seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas : ( 1 ) the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue ;
( 2 ) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes ;
and , most pervasively , ( 3 ) their interpretation of who is a real pro , of what it means to be a professional man in a technical , fragmented society .</s>

<s>( 1 ) most of the realtors minimized their own understanding of and role in the racial issue , pleading that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society .</s>

<s>there is some reality to this ;
the Commission on Race and Housing concluded that there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less racially prejudiced , on the whole , than any other segment of the American population .</s>

<s>but such a reaction obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both J and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices .</s>

<s>also , it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed .</s>

<s>like business and university groups generally , these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make .</s>

<s>realtors , both generally and in this group , have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values , a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension .</s>

<s>recent studies by the Commission on Race and Housing and others , however , point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion .</s>

<s>there are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values , the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the Negroes' desire for well-kept housing , privacy , etc.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in .</s>

<s>often they are able to get in only because the area is declining economically .</s>

<s>significantly , no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes ( published by the University of California Press ) that present the commission's findings .</s>

<s>no one anticipates any radical shift in this situation , but questions concerning reading habits , the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised .</s>

<s>the role of both church and university as sources of information and settings within which the implications of such information may be explored needs consideration .</s>

<s>relevant facts , however , extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of harmonious neighborhoods .</s>

<s>discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity , the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality , and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife .</s>

<s>against the grain of creation
( 2 ) realtors realize , of course , that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing .</s>

<s>on the positive side , recent Federal action has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position ;
anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and , while specific provisions have varied , the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage .</s>

<s>realtors in attendance at the colloquium expressed interest , for example , in Connecticut's new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would like to have to obey , but in support of which none had been willing to go on public record .</s>

<s>as far as they were aware , the Connecticut Association of Real Estate Boards had not officially opposed the bill's passage or lobbied in its support .</s>

<s>( this has not been the case everywhere .</s>

<s>in 1957 , the Real Estate Boards of New York City actively opposed the then pending private housing anti-discrimination law .</s>

<s>official reasoning : the bill was a wanton invasion of basic property rights .
)</s>

<s>there are sins of omission as well as commission ;
the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations , either negative or positive , plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced .</s>

<s>judicial opinion since the Supreme Court decision on Shelley v. Kraemer ( 1948 ) has rendered racial restrictive covenants unenforcible .</s>

<s>such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry , but there is little evidence that realtors , or at least their associations , have repudiated the principle in such clauses .</s>

<s>in the states that have passed laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing , support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of social reformism that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid .</s>

<s>but as yet , no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into all-white neighborhoods .</s>

<s>one of the roles of the social scientist , ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work .</s>

<s>but responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional , white , American good .</s>

<s>such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world , let us say a community , that embraces Scarsdale or Yonkers , but is also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive .</s>

<s>that community of all creation is , then , the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment .</s>

<s>racial discrimination is wrong , then , not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the Creator .</s>

<s>thus , moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions .</s>

<s>a fragmented Society
( 3 ) over the years , individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed .</s>

<s>most realtors and real estate brokers talk of themselves as professional people with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions .</s>

<s>but what significance attaches to professional , beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meeting a client's stated needs as already noted ?</s>

<s>our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other .</s>

<s>as a theologian in the group pointed out , a professional was , before the modern period of technical specialization , one who professed to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills .</s>

<s>if we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization : science and religion .</s>

<s>science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom .</s>

<s>religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed .</s>

<s>how can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge ?</s>

<s>we may feel pessimistic at the outlook .</s>

<s>and yet there is a note of hope , because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision .</s>

<s>we are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word is not matter but music .</s>

<s>and it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith .</s>

<s>atomic energy
to see this vision in perspective , we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom .</s>

<s>you know that I could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima .</s>

<s>it was only about the size of a baseball ;
but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of 20,000 tons of J .</s>

<s>that is enough J to fill the tower of the Empire State Building ;
and with the availability of bombs of that size , war became a new problem .</s>

<s>now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world .</s>

<s>but we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen bomb .</s>

<s>hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce .</s>

<s>we know that we have hydrogen in water ;
water is F and the J stands for hydrogen ;
there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies .</s>

<s>I have calculated that if I could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body , I would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on Hiroshima .</s>

<s>I won't try the experiment , but I think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go , there would be quite an explosion .</s>

<s>and then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in Delaware Bay or in the ocean beyond .</s>

<s>salt water is still F , the same hydrogen is there .</s>

<s>and the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today .</s>

<s>of course , there is also an optimistic side to the picture .</s>

<s>for if I knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity , I could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body I could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire United States for some days .</s>

<s>and think , if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power , what a wonderful public utility company we would make .</s>

<s>with just the hydrogen of our bodies , we could run the world for years .</s>

<s>then think of Delaware Bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come .</s>

<s>it is power with which we can literally rebuild the world , provide adequate housing , food , education , abundant living for everyone everywhere .</s>

<s>an octillion atoms
now let us see where this power comes from .</s>

<s>to grasp our new view of the atom , we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is .</s>

<s>I have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry .</s>

<s>one night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table , and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms ;
and I asked myself a question : suppose I had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body , how large an area would they cover ?</s>

<s>I calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body ;
that is a figure one with 27 ciphers , quite a large number .</s>

<s>then I calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator ;
a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic ;
a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people ;
and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of Philadelphia .</s>

<s>I saw that I would soon run out of buildings at this rate , so I decided to take another measure -- the whole state of Pennsylvania .</s>

<s>imagine that there is a blizzard over Pennsylvania , but instead of snowing snow , it snows peas ;
so we get the whole state covered with peas , about four feet deep .</s>

<s>you can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars ;
Pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas .</s>

<s>but we still have a long way to go .</s>

<s>next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the entire globe -- North America , South America , Europe , Asia , and Africa , all covered with peas four feet deep ;
then we have sextillion peas .</s>

<s>next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas , then we go out among the neighboring stars , collect 250 planets each the size of the earth , and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep ;
and then we have septillion .</s>

<s>finally we go into the farthest reaches of the Milky Way ;
we get 250,000 planets ;
we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body .</s>

<s>so you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are .</s>

<s>a speck -- and space
now although an atom is small , we can still in imagination have a look at it .</s>

<s>let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that I swallow a magic Alice In Wonderland growing pill .</s>

<s>I start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me .</s>

<s>I shoot up through the roof , into the sky , past the clouds , through the stratosphere , out beyond the moon , out among the planets , until I am over a hundred and fifty million miles long .</s>

<s>then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a hundred yards across , a balloon big enough to put a football field inside .</s>

<s>and if you should step inside of such a magnified atom , according to the physics of forty years ago , you would see circulating over your head , down at the sides , and under your feet , some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs .</s>

<s>these balls are moving in great circles and ellipses , and are of course , the electrons , the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone .</s>

<s>since these electrons are moving like planets , you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom .</s>

<s>so you look down there and you see a tiny , whirling point about the size of the head of a pin .</s>

<s>this is the atomic sun , the atomic nucleus .</s>

<s>even if the atom were big enough to hold a football field , this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead .</s>

<s>it is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits ;
it also contains nearly all the mass , and the atomic energy .</s>

<s>you may ask what else there is , and the answer is nothing -- nothing but empty space .</s>

<s>and since you are made of atoms , you are nothing much but empty space , too .</s>

<s>if I could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down , squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge , you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone , you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper .</s>

<s>someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing .</s>

<s>at any rate , it shows us how immaterial we are .</s>

<s>music of the spheres
now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture .</s>

<s>for we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics ;
and therefore the atom was really just a little machine ;
and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts .</s>

<s>so if you are made of atoms , you are just a big machine ;
and since the universe is also made of atoms , it is just a supermachine .</s>

<s>and this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe , governed by the laws of cause and effect , bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom .</s>

<s>and this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists .</s>

<s>then came the scientific revolution in the late 1920's .</s>

<s>a suggestion from Louis De Broglie , a physicist in France , showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves .</s>

<s>and to see the meaning of this new picture , imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today .</s>

<s>now as you step inside , instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets , you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it .</s>

<s>these ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral .</s>

<s>and as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms , you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music .</s>

<s>it is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony .</s>

<s>harmony , melody , counterpoint symphonic structure are there ;
and as this music ebbs and flows , there is an antiphonal chorus from all the atoms outside , in fact from the atoms of the entire universe .</s>

<s>and so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe , we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music .</s>

<s>the Island of Nantucket , part of the State of Massachusetts , lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother State .</s>

<s>some of the Island is sand and is not suitable for living .</s>

<s>the Island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors ;
the rest is obtained from harbor scallops .</s>

<s>during about three and a half months of the year , in the summer , there are three boats that run from the mainland to the Island carrying passengers , food , and cars ;
but the rest of the year only one boat is needed , which ties up at the mainland nights and makes the trip down to Nantucket in the daytime .</s>

<s>this is a fine trip , too , on a good day .</s>

<s>with Martha's Vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other , it makes an excellent trip of about three hours .</s>

<s>to what extent and in what ways did Christianity affect the United States of America in the nineteenth century ?</s>

<s>how far and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age ?</s>

<s>to what extent did it mould the morals and the social , economic , and political life and institutions of the country ?</s>

<s>a complete picture is impossible -- partly because of the limitations of space , partly because for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the Christian faith data are unobtainable .</s>

<s>even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of Christianity from other factors .</s>

<s>although a complete picture cannot be given , we can indicate some aspects of life into which the Christian faith entered as at least one creative factor .</s>

<s>at times we can say that it was the major factor .</s>

<s>what in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation .</s>

<s>as we have seen , a growing proportion , although in 1914 still a minority , were members of churches .</s>

<s>presumably those who did not have a formal church connexion had also felt the influence of Christianity to a greater or lesser extent .</s>

<s>many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in Christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse .</s>

<s>the form of Christianity to which they were exposed was for some the Protestantism of the older stock , for others the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration ;
for still others , mostly of the nineteenth-century immigration , it was Roman Catholicism , and for a small minority it was Eastern Orthodoxy .</s>

<s>upon all of them played the intellectual , social , political , and economic attitudes , institutions , and customs of the nation .</s>

<s>upon most of these Christianity had left an impress and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was .</s>

<s>yet to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual showed the effects of Christianity would be impossible .</s>

<s>at best only an approximation could be arrived at .</s>

<s>to generalize for the entire nation would be absurd .</s>

<s>for instance , we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to Christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose .</s>

<s>the temptation is to say that , as the percentage of church members mounted , the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level .</s>

<s>yet this cannot be proved .</s>

<s>we know that in the early part of the century many Protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed .</s>

<s>thus Baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness , fighting , malicious gossip , lying , cheating , sexual irregularities , gambling , horse racing , and failure to pay just debts .</s>

<s>if guilty , the offender might be excluded from membership .</s>

<s>as church membership burgeoned , such measures faded into desuetude .</s>

<s>but whether this was accompanied by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know .</s>

<s>what we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which Christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation .</s>

<s>we have already hinted at the fashion in which Christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life .</s>

<s>we will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals through reform movements , through programmes for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to Christian standards , and through leaders in the government .</s>

<s>throughout the nineteenth century Christianity exerted its influence on American society as a whole primarily through the Protestantism of the older stock .</s>

<s>by the end of the century the Roman Catholic Church was beginning to make itself felt , mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour .</s>

<s>in the twentieth century its influence grew , as did that of the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration .</s>

<s>the American dream
the ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the Protestantism of the older stock .</s>

<s>thus America , the most widely sung of the patriotic songs , was written by a New England Baptist clergyman , Samuel Francis Smith ( 1808-1895 ) , while a student in Andover Theological Seminary .</s>

<s>with its zeal for liberty and its dependence on God it breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the Evangelical revivals .</s>

<s>the great seal of the United States was obviously inspired by the Christian faith .</s>

<s>here was what was called the American dream , namely , the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that God could bless it .</s>

<s>later in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of Katherine Lee Bates ( 1859-1929 ) , daughter and granddaughter of New England Congregational ministers , in her widely sung hymn , written in 1893 , America The Beautiful , with the words o beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness .</s>

<s>America , America , God mend thy every flaw , confirm thy soul in self control , the liberty in law .</s>

<s>o beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears .</s>

<s>America , America , God shed His grace on thee , and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea .</s>

<s>the American dream was compounded of many strains .</s>

<s>some were clearly of Christian origin , among them the Great Awakening and other revivals which helped to make Christian liberty , Christian equality , and Christian fraternity the passion of the land .</s>

<s>some have seen revivalism and the search for Christian perfection as the fountain-head of the American hope .</s>

<s>here , too , must be placed Unitarianism and , less obviously from Christian inspiration , Emerson , Transcendentalism , and the idealism of Walt Whitman .</s>

<s>we must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth -- among them Melville , Hawthorne , and Henry James the elder , all of them out of a Christian background .</s>

<s>reform movements
with such a dream arising , at least in part , from the Protestant heritage of the United States and built into the foundations of the nation , it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression .</s>

<s>a number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills .</s>

<s>significantly , the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements , especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century , came from men and women of New England birth or parentage and from either Trinitarian or Unitarian Congregationalism .</s>

<s>several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism .</s>

<s>Quakers , some from New England , had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted .</s>

<s>we do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of New England ancestry also issued the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , the Seventh Day Adventists , Christian Science , the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions , the American Home Missionary Society , the American Bible Society , and New England theology .</s>

<s>the atmosphere was one of optimism , of confidence in human progress , and of a determination to rid the world of its ills .</s>

<s>the Hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence , although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election , inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours for others , looked for the early coming of the Millennium , and was paralleled by the confidence in man's ability cherished by the Unitarians , Emerson , and the Transcendentalists .</s>

<s>we should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arose from the kindred Evangelicalism of the British Isles and the Pietism of the Continent of Europe -- among them prison reform , anti-slavery measures , legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour , the Inner Mission , and the Red Cross .</s>

<s>we cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills .</s>

<s>a few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose .</s>

<s>several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century .</s>

<s>others were ephemeral .</s>

<s>some disappeared with the attainment of their purpose .</s>

<s>still others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age .</s>

<s>the anti-slavery movement
the movement to end Negro slavery began before 1815 and mounted after that year until , as a result of the Civil War , emancipation was achieved .</s>

<s>long before 1815 the Christian conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly .</s>

<s>for example , in 1693 the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of Friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply .</s>

<s>in the latter year Samuel Hopkins , from whom the Hopkinsian strain of New England theology took its name , asked the Continental Congress to abolish slavery .</s>

<s>as we have seen , Methodism early took a stand against slavery .</s>

<s>beginning at least as far back as 1789 various Baptist bodies condemned slavery .</s>

<s>after 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mounted , chiefly among Protestants and those of Protestant background of the older stock .</s>

<s>the nineteenth-century immigration , whether Protestant or Roman Catholic , was not so much concerned , for very few if any among them held slaves : they were mostly in the Northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out , or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves .</s>

<s>the anti-slavery movement took many forms .</s>

<s>Benjamin Lundy ( 1789-1839 ) , a Quaker , was a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies .</s>

<s>it was he who turned the attention of William Lloyd Garrison ( 1805-1879 ) to the subject .</s>

<s>Garrison , Massachusetts born of Nova Scotian parentage , was by temperament and conviction a reformer .</s>

<s>chiefly remembered because of his incessant advocacy of immediate and unconditional abolition , he also espoused a great variety of other causes -- among them women's rights , prohibition , and justice to the Indians .</s>

<s>incurably optimistic , dogmatic , and utterly fearless , in his youth a devout Baptist , in spite of his friendship for the Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier ( 1807-1892 ) he eventually attacked the orthodox churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration of the Bible .</s>

<s>a marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the Finney revivals .</s>

<s>Finney himself , while opposed to slavery , placed his chief emphasis on evangelism , but from his converts issued much of the leadership of the anti-slavery campaign .</s>

<s>Theodore Dwight Weld ( 1803-1895 ) was especially active .</s>

<s>Weld was the son and grandson of New England Congregational ministers .</s>

<s>as a youth he became one of Finney's band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men .</s>

<s>a strong temperance advocate , through the influence of a favorite teacher , Charles Stewart , another Finney convert , he devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause .</s>

<s>a group of young men influenced by him enrolled in Lane Theological Seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery position .</s>

<s>the majority then went to the infant Oberlin .</s>

<s>they and others employed some of Finney's techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause .</s>

<s>Weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions of such men as Joshua R. Giddings and Edwin M. Stanton , enlisted John Quincy Adams , and helped provide ideas which underlay Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin .</s>

<s>he shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame .</s>

<s>Wendell Phillips ( 1811-1884 ) , from a prominent Massachusetts family , in his teens was converted under the preaching of Lyman Beecher .</s>

<s>although he later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently outspoken against social evils , he remained a devout Christian .</s>

<s>he was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition , but he also stood for equal rights for women , for opportunity for the freedmen , and for prohibition .</s>

<s>the anti-slavery movement and other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and financial undergirding by Arthur Tappan ( 1786-1865 ) and his younger brother , Lewis Tappan ( 1788-1873 ) .</s>

<s>individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits ;
they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer , even more terrible abilities .</s>

<s>their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes , but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe .</s>

<s>royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power .</s>

<s>thus , the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors .</s>

<s>but this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities .</s>

<s>since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits , the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living .</s>

<s>the royal ritual generated power into the other world : it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits , and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world .</s>

<s>proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable of generating power for use in the spirit world ;
but naturally , the royal ritual , which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits , was held responsible for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom .</s>

<s>this is the familiar system of cosmic government .</s>

<s>the Chinese emperor , by proper observance of ritual , manifested divine powers .</s>

<s>he regulated the dualities of light and darkness , Yang and Yin , which are locked in eternal struggle .</s>

<s>by swaying the balance between them , he effected the alternation of the seasons .</s>

<s>his power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to petitions .</s>

<s>in this system , no man is exempt from obligations .</s>

<s>failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's family , outrages to community propriety , any departure from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead .</s>

<s>and to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath , and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters .</s>

<s>the family home was , in fact , a temple ;
and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature .</s>

<s>the dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear .</s>

<s>the common belief was that there existed one moral order , which included everything .</s>

<s>the dead controlled the material prosperity of the living , and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control .</s>

<s>men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code .</s>

<s>if the moral code were flouted , the proper balance of the universe would be upset , and the disastrous result could be floods , plague , or famine .</s>

<s>modern Westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material , largely because in the West the historical trend has been to deny the connection .</s>

<s>living in urban conditions , away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view , the individual may find it possible , say , to commit adultery not only without personal misgivings , but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes .</s>

<s>basing action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart -- plus the added liberation from the constraint of silent burial urns .</s>

<s>in China , the magical system par excellence was Taoism .</s>

<s>the Taoists were Quietist mystics , who saw an unchanging unity -- the Tao -- underlying all phenomena .</s>

<s>it was this timeless unity that was all-important , and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality .</s>

<s>the Taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation ;
in other words , they were actually an organization of magicians .</s>

<s>Mahayana Buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts .</s>

<s>after this form of Indian Buddhism had been introduced into China , it underwent extensive changes .</s>

<s>during its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries , Mahayana offered a supernatural package to the Chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical Zen morsels offered to the modern Western reader .</s>

<s>Mahayana had gods , and magic , a pantheon , heavens and hells , and gorgeously appareled priests , monks , and nuns , all of whom wielded power over souls in the other world .</s>

<s>the self-realized Mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic .</s>

<s>the Mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic , that made the world into a huge magical garden .</s>

<s>in its monastic form , Mahayana was merely an organization of magic-practicing monks ( bonzes , ) who catered to the Chinese faith in the supernatural .</s>

<s>nonmagical Confucianism was a secular , rational philosophy , but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government .</s>

<s>Confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power .</s>

<s>if a man lived a classical life , he need not fear the spirits -- for only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him .</s>

<s>but let us not be mistaken about Confucian virtue ;
this was not virtue as we understand the word today , and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation .</s>

<s>to the Confucian , virtue simply meant mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones .</s>

<s>propriety was synonymous with ritual observance , the mark of a true gentleman .</s>

<s>to live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for man's fate .</s>

<s>this , in brief , was the historical background out of which Zen emerged .</s>

<s>promoters of Zen to the West record its ancestry , and recognize that Zen grew out of a combination of Taoism and Indian Mahayana Buddhism .</s>

<s>but the marvelous person that is supposed to result from Zen exhibits more Chinese practicality than Indian speculation -- he possesses magical powers , and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls .</s>

<s>proponents of Zen to the West emphasize disproportionately the amount of Mahayana Buddhism in Zen , probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical Taoist ideas with more respectable Buddhist metaphysic .</s>

<s>but in the Chinese mind , there was little difference between the two -- the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be .</s>

<s>actually , Zen owes more to Chinese Quietism than it does to Mahayana Buddhism .</s>

<s>the Ch'an ( Zen ) sect may have derived its metaphysic from Mahayana , but its psychology was pure early Taoist .</s>

<s>this is well evidenced by the Quietist doctrines carried over in Zen : the idea of the inward turning of thought , the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so that a return to purity , peace , and stillness -- a union with the Infinite , with the Tao -- could be effected .</s>

<s>in fact , the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of the direct thinking Zennist was a feature of Taoism .</s>

<s>so , too , was the insistence on the relativity of the external world , and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure , indwelling spirit : the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness .</s>

<s>Zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience .</s>

<s>one of its features attractive to the West is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts .</s>

<s>one patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse .</s>

<s>but this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom of action for which the Westerner mistakes it .</s>

<s>it is simply that in Taoist tradition -- as in all good mysticisms -- books , words , or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience .</s>

<s>the truth -- the Eternal Truth -- is not transmittable by words .</s>

<s>reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge , but a positive handicap .</s>

<s>the technique of reality confusion -- the use of paradox and riddles to shake the mind's grip on reality -- originated with fourth and third century B.C.</s>

<s>Chinese Quietism : the koan is not basically a new device .</s>

<s>it is important for an understanding of Zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man .</s>

<s>in the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government , only the ruling elite was ever concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature : popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers .</s>

<s>and this is only natural -- witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest wonder drug .</s>

<s>early Chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed at a mystic pantheist union with the divine , personal salvation being achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence .</s>

<s>but this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers .</s>

<s>the anchorite strove , in fact , to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power .</s>

<s>thus , the Mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was distilled down to a bare self-seeking , and for this reason , the mystic in Asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation .</s>

<s>as the Zen literature reveals , as soon as an early Zen master attained fame in seclusion , he was called out into the world to exercise his powers .</s>

<s>the early Anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles .</s>

<s>exponents of Zen often insist that very early Zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of China , and proposed instead a more mature , less credulous view of the universe .</s>

<s>in support of this , stories from the early literature are cited to show that Zen attacks the idea of supernatural power .</s>

<s>but actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in fact supposed to possess , as well as the extreme degree of popular credulity : Hwang Pah ( O Baku ) , one day going up Mount Tien Tai which was believed to have been inhabited by Arhats with supernatural powers , met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light .</s>

<s>thereupon Hwang Pah said : if I knew thou art an Arhat , I would have doubled you up before thou got over there ]

<s>( 1 ) a second tale shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess : on one occasion Yang Shan ( Kyo-zan ) saw a stranger monk flying through the air .</s>

<s>I stopped , responded the man , several times to look at beautiful sceneries .</s>

<s>thou mayst have supernatural powers , exclaimed Yang Shan , yet thou must give back the Spirit of Buddha to me .</s>

<s>then the monk praised Yang Shan saying : I have come over to China in order to worship Manjucri , and met unexpectedly with Minor Shakya , and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from India , went back through the air .</s>

<s>I am a magazine ;
my name is Guideposts ;
this issue that you are reading marks my 15th anniversary .</s>

<s>when I came into being , 15 years ago , I had one primary purpose : to help men and women everywhere to know God better , and through knowing Him better to become happier and more effective people .</s>

<s>that purpose has never changed .</s>

<s>when you read me , you are holding in your hands the product of many minds and hearts .</s>

<s>some of the people who speak through my pages are famous ;
others unknown .</s>

<s>some work with their hands .</s>

<s>some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope .</s>

<s>some are so filled with gratitude , for the gift of life and the love of God , that their joy spills out on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands whom they have never known , and will never see .</s>

<s>fifteen years ago , there were no Guideposts at all .</s>

<s>this month a million Guideposts will circulate all over the world .</s>

<s>experts in the publishing field consider this astounding .</s>

<s>they do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved such a following .</s>

<s>to me , the explanation is very simple .</s>

<s>I am not doing anything , of myself .</s>

<s>I am merely a channel for something .</s>

<s>what is this something ?</s>

<s>I cannot define it fully .</s>

<s>it is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness , even when they turn away from it .</s>

<s>it is the power that holds the stars in their orbits , but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass .</s>

<s>it is the whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is .</s>

<s>it is mankind's wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace .</s>

<s>all things are possible to God , but He chooses -- usually -- to work through people .</s>

<s>sometimes such people sense that they are being used ;
sometimes not .</s>

<s>fifteen years ago , troubled by the rising tide of materialism in the post-war world , a businessman and a minister asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine in which men and women , regardless of creed or color , could set forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living .</s>

<s>the businessman was Raymond Thornburg .</s>

<s>the minister was Norman Vincent Peale .</s>

<s>neither had any publishing experience , but they had faith in their idea .</s>

<s>they borrowed a typewriter , raised about $2,000 in contributions , hired a secretary , persuaded a couple of young men to join them for almost no pay and began mailing out a collection of unstapled leaflets that they called Guideposts .</s>

<s>compared to the big , established magazines , my first efforts seemed feeble indeed .</s>

<s>but from the start they had two important ingredients : sincerity and realism .</s>

<s>the people who told the stories were sincere .</s>

<s>and the stories they told were true .</s>

<s>for example , early in my life , when one of my editorial workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations met the needs of New York's down-and-outers , he didn't just ask questions .</s>

<s>Len LeSourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days .</s>

<s>that was nearly 13 years ago .</s>

<s>Len LeSourd is my executive editor today .</s>

<s>many of you are familiar , I'm sure , with the story of my early struggles : the fire in January , 1947 , that destroyed everything -- even our precious list of subscribers .</s>

<s>the help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere .</s>

<s>the crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me .</s>

<s>that was when a remarkable woman , Teresa Durlach , came to my aid -- not so much with money , as with wisdom and courage .</s>

<s>you're not living up to your own principles , she told my discouraged people .</s>

<s>you're so preoccupied that you've let your faith grow dim .</s>

<s>what do you want -- a hundred thousand subscribers ?</s>

<s>visualize them , then , believe you are getting them , and you will have them ]
and the 100,000 subscribers became a reality .</s>

<s>and then 500,000 .</s>

<s>and now a million January Guideposts are in circulation .</s>

<s>with our growth came expansion into new fields of service .</s>

<s>today more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees .</s>

<s>they say all personnel have spiritual needs which Guideposts helps to meet .</s>

<s>hundreds of civic clubs , business firms and individuals make me available to school teachers throughout the land .</s>

<s>they say it helps them bring back into schools the spiritual and moral values on which this country was built .</s>

<s>thousands of free copies are sent each month to chaplains in the Armed Forces , to prison libraries and to hospitals everywhere .</s>

<s>bedridden people say I am easy to hold -- and read .</s>

<s>three years ago it became possible to finance a Braille edition for blind readers .</s>

<s>throughout these exciting years I have been fortunate for , although I have never offered great financial inducements , talent has found its way to me : William Boal who so ably organizes business operations ;
John Beach who guides circulation ;
Irving Granville and Nelson Rector who travel widely calling on business firms .</s>

<s>searching for the best in spiritual stories , my roving editors cover not only the country , but the whole world .</s>

<s>Glenn Kittler has been twice to Africa , once spending a week with Dr. Albert Schweitzer .</s>

<s>last summer John and Elizabeth Sherrill were in Alaska .</s>

<s>Van Varner recently returned from Russia .</s>

<s>twice a month the editorial staff meets in New York for an early supper , then a long evening of idea-exchange .</s>

<s>around the table sit Protestant , Catholic , and Jew .</s>

<s>each contributes something different , and something important : Ruth Peale , her wide experience in church work ;
Sidney Fields , years of experience as a New York columnist ;
Catherine Marshall LeSourd , the insight that has made her books world-famous and Norm Mullendore , the keen perception of an advertising executive .</s>

<s>there are people who travel long distances to assure my continued existence .</s>

<s>Elaine St. Johns may fly in from the West Coast for the editorial staff meetings .</s>

<s>Starr Jones gets up every morning at five o'clock , milks his family cow , attends to farm chores , and then takes a two-hour train trip to New York .</s>

<s>Arthur Gordon comes once a month all the way from Georgia .</s>

<s>we have also seen the power of faith at work among us .</s>

<s>Rose Weiss , who handles all the prayer-requests that we receive , answering each letter personally , has the serene selflessness that comes from suffering : she has had many major operations , and now gets about in a limited way on braces and crutches .</s>

<s>recently , John Sherrill was stricken with one of the deadliest forms of cancer .</s>

<s>we prayed for John , during surgery , we asked others to pray ;
all over the country a massive shield of prayer was thrown around him .</s>

<s>today the cancer is gone .</s>

<s>perhaps it is not fair to mention some people without mentioning all .</s>

<s>but , you see , those who are not mentioned will not resent it .</s>

<s>that is the kind of people they are .</s>

<s>perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn affairs , a little sanctimonious ?</s>

<s>not so .</s>

<s>serious , yes , but also much laughter .</s>

<s>sharp division of opinion , too , and strenuous debate .</s>

<s>there are brain-wracking searches for the right word , the best phrase , the most helpful idea .</s>

<s>and there is also something intangible that hovers around the table .</s>

<s>a good word for it is fellowship .</s>

<s>a shorter word is .</s>

<s>each meeting starts with a prayer , offered love spontaneously by one member of the group .</s>

<s>it takes many forms , this prayer , but in essence it is always a request for guidance , for open minds and gentle hearts , for honesty and sincerity , for the wisdom and the insights that will help Guideposts' readers .</s>

<s>for you , readers , are an all-important part of the spiritual experiment that is Guideposts .</s>

<s>I need your support , your criticism , your encouragement , your prayers .</s>

<s>I am a magazine ;

<s>my message , today , is the same as it was 15 years ago : that there is goodness in people , and strength and love in God .</s>

<s>Havana was filled with an excitement which you could see in the brightness of men's eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices .</s>

<s>the hated dictator Batista had fled .</s>

<s>rumors flew from lip to lip that Fidel Castro was on his way to Havana , coming from the mountains where he had fought Batista for five years .</s>

<s>already the city was filled with Barbudos , the bearded , war-dirty Revolutionaries , carrying carbines , waving to the crowds that lined the Prado .</s>

<s>and then Castro himself did come , bearded , smiling ;
yet if you looked closely you'd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips .</s>

<s>at first I was happy to throw the support of our newspaper behind this man .</s>

<s>I am sure that Castro was happy , too , about that support .</s>

<s>Diario De La Marina was the oldest and most influential paper in Cuba , with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny .</s>

<s>my grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials .</s>

<s>my own earliest memories are of exiles : my three brothers and I were taken often to the United States to visit relatives while my father stayed on to fight the dictator Machado .</s>

<s>when it was my turn , I , too , printed the truth as I knew it about Batista , and rejoiced to see his regime topple .</s>

<s>none of us was aware that the biggest fight was still ahead .</s>

<s>I was full of hope as Fidel Castro came into Havana .</s>

<s>within a week , however , I began to suspect that something was wrong .</s>

<s>for Castro was bringing Cuba not freedom , but hatred .</s>

<s>he spent long hours before the J spitting out promises of revenge .</s>

<s>he showed us how he dealt with his enemies : he executed them before J cameras .</s>

<s>on home sets children were watching the death throes of men who were shot before the paredon , the firing wall .</s>

<s>Castro's reforms ?</s>

<s>he seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance .</s>

<s>new schools were rising , but with this went a harsh proclamation : any academic degree earned during Batista's regime was invalid .</s>

<s>economic aid ?</s>

<s>he had promised cheaper housing : arbitrarily he cut all rents in half , whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room .</s>

<s>under another law , hundreds of farms were seized .</s>

<s>farm workers had their wages cut almost in half .</s>

<s>of this , only 50 cents a day was paid in cash , the rest in script usable only in People's Stores .</s>

<s>a suspicion was growing that Fidel Castro was a Communist .</s>

<s>in my mind , I began to review : his use of hate to gain support ;
his People's Courts ;
his division of society into two classes , one the hero , the other the villain .</s>

<s>but most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the Palace ;
many came from Communist countries .</s>

<s>what should I do about it , I asked myself ?</s>

<s>I had watched Castro handling his enemies before the paredon .</s>

<s>there was no doubt in my mind that if I crossed him , mobs would appear outside our windows shouting paredon ]
paredon ]
what should I do ?</s>

<s>I was proud of the new buildings which housed Diario now : the rotogravures , gleaming behind glass doors ;
the thump and whir of our new presses .</s>

<s>here was a powerful , ready-made medium , but it could speak only if I told it to .</s>

<s>then one day , early in January , 1960 , I sat down at my desk , and suddenly I was aware of the crucifix .</s>

<s>it was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had given me .</s>

<s>I had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind me always to use the power of the paper in a Christian manner .</s>

<s>now it seemed almost as if Jesus were looking down at me with sadness in His eyes , saying : you will lose the paper .</s>

<s>you may lose your life .</s>

<s>but do in that you have any choice ?</s>

<s>I knew moment that I did not have any choice .</s>

<s>from that day on I began to write editorials about the things I did not think correct in Fidel Castro's regime .</s>

<s>too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents don't want sonny-boy to lift all those old barbell things because you'll stunt your growth or because childish taunts from his schoolmates , like hey lookit Mr. America ;

<s>after all , a guy's gotta have a little ego ]
therefore it's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates ]
this happy , always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new Junior Mr. Canada -- Henri De Courcy .</s>

<s>far from discouraging Henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments .</s>

<s>instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority , Professor Roland Claude .</s>

<s>and they couldn't have entrusted Henri to better hands because le professeur knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth .</s>

<s>that's because the good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal Health Studio which is located at 1821 Mt.</s>

<s>Royal East in Montreal .</s>

<s>undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning pupils ( every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other ) .</s>

<s>there's Gaetan D'Amours who is our newest Mr. Canada ;
Jean-Paul Senesac , whose story appeared here two issues ago ;
Jack Boissoneault , who was with us last month ;
Charles Harve , who recently won the Most Muscular Man subdivision award in the Mr. Canada event ;
and a host of others .</s>

<s>yesiree , the professor knows his muscles ]
now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4' 10'' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight .</s>

<s>about that time he began reading Mr. America and Muscle Builder and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight gaining .</s>

<s>seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of Quick-Wate and Super-Protein , those two wonder-working Weider food supplements , he decided to try them and see what they could do for him .</s>

<s>well , sir they did real great ]
for in almost less time than it takes to tell it , Henri's bodyweight was increasing rapidly .</s>

<s>of course he did some exercising .</s>

<s>he's crazy about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his skinny frame .</s>

<s>Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them very much .</s>

<s>but he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body .</s>

<s>it was muscular but it wasn't symmetrical .</s>

<s>a real nothing torso , says Henri .</s>

<s>it never seemed to widen .</s>

<s>it just got longer and longer .</s>

<s>that's when he went to Professor Claude .</s>

<s>and at once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it .</s>

<s>in his gym the professor has some of the most knocked out equipment since Vic Tanny .</s>

<s>Mr. Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now-famous Weider Push-Pull Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or pushing movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a pulling exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group .</s>

<s>so right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous moon bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull Super-Set consisting of the wide-grip Straight-Arm Pullover ( the pull part of the Push-Pull Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type gladiator J , while stimulating the upper J and frontal deltoids .</s>

<s>as you can see , in this Push-Pull Super Set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time ]
now when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No.</s>

<s>1 , the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting him on four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No.</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>Super-Set No.</s>

<s>2 is made up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both moon and flat benches .</s>

<s>the push exercise of this Push-Pull Super-Set is the Bench Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation .</s>

<s>you need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the J .</s>

<s>the dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the J .</s>

<s>the pull exercise in this Super-Set is the one-dumbbell Bent-Arm Pullover .</s>

<s>( note how strongly the upper J and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords ) .</s>

<s>in the third Push-Pull Super-Set the push exercise is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars , while the pull exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms .</s>

<s>the Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage stretcher ever invented ]
this is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved .</s>

<s>you'll know when you've made the greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will touch ]
as you see , the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e grip .</s>

<s>he has to ;
he just can't do anything about it at all ]
but as you can also see , it's not a painful exercise at all , because Henri De Courcy -- the happy bodybuilder -- looks as though he were having the time of his life ]
the last exercise of Roland Claude's prescribed program for Henri is a single exercise , done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between sets .</s>

<s>by this time Henri's entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area is pumped-up to almost bursting point , and Claude takes time to do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work .</s>

<s>he has Henri do from four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press ( note the high incline ) .</s>

<s>this gives a wide flare to the J , causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and J .</s>

<s>this is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests ;
that steel-edged carved-out-of-solid rock looks of the great champions .</s>

<s>so with four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No.</s>

<s>1 , four of No.</s>

<s>2 , four of No.</s>

<s>3 and four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press , you can see that Henri De Courcy has had a terrific mass-building , muscle-shaping , torso-defining workout that cannot be improved upon .</s>

<s>physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone .</s>

<s>rarer still is a Mr. America or Mr. Universe of true Herculean build .</s>

<s>the aspects of physical development that catch the judges' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion -- superior definition of the muscles .</s>

<s>now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light-weight workouts .</s>

<s>but contest definition -- that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's chisel -- is something quite different .</s>

<s>this comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition-specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him .</s>

<s>often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others .</s>

<s>because they are minority exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten .</s>

<s>only when the newest Mr. America or Mr. Universe discovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once again see how effective they really are .</s>

<s>the exercise I shall discuss in this -- the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition-specialization of a particular body part -- is the One Leg Lunge .</s>

<s>why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths ]
it is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline -- that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders ;
a criterion of muscle drama that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike ;
the facet of muscular development that wins prizes .</s>

<s>definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which is easily understandable .</s>

<s>the One Leg Lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts .</s>

<s>but for purely definition purposes -- used in conjunction with your regular Squatting , Leg Curling , Leg Extensor programs -- a heavy weight is not needed .</s>

<s>indeed , a lighter weight works much better because a greater , more extensive split can be performed .</s>

<s>used in several sets of high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin ]
really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times , for the following suggestions show why it is so effective : 1 .</s>

<s>it's a complete thigh contraction-extension exercise .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>it places terrific tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition .</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>it improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder , and helps to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed .</s>

<s>4 .</s>

<s>it increases flexibility of the legs .</s>

<s>5 .</s>

<s>it speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately , thus enabling a massive , concentrated effort to be focused on each .</s>

<s>you'll need your Weider Power Stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's done : 1 .</s>

<s>place your Power Stands in position and adjust their height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>place a suitably-loaded barbell across them ;
grasp the bar ( which will rest against the back of your neck ) ;
extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split .</s>

<s>now raise the weight by straightening your front leg , without moving your feet .</s>

<s>when the front knee is straight and locked , allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the Power Stands .</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>after you have taken a breather , reverse the position of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear , and the rear thigh now to the front , and perform the same movement in the same manner .</s>

<s>that's the One-Leg Lunge in a nutshell .</s>

<s>you should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you make your first experiments just for safety .</s>

<s>you should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance-wise .</s>

<s>oh , you'll wobble and weave quite a bit at first .</s>

<s>but don't worry .</s>

<s>before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran ]
although I suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck .</s>

<s>squat-style lifters and leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front .</s>

<s>the most beautiful bed of pansies I've seen was in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day .</s>

<s>pansies are supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun .</s>

<s>I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather .</s>

<s>he seemed puzzled by my question .</s>

<s>I just love them , he said .</s>

<s>the more I talked with him , the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming .</s>

<s>of course his love was expressed in intelligent care .</s>

<s>he planted the pansy seeds himself , buying them from a pansy specialist .</s>

<s>these specialists , I learned , have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers .</s>

<s>their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains .</s>

<s>I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants .</s>

<s>occasionally , when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did ;
but pansy seeds , he told me , soon run down .</s>

<s>it's best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them .</s>

<s>his soil was nothing special , just prairie land , but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose , spongy and brown-black .</s>

<s>I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture , tilth and body .</s>

<s>it isn't easy to describe it , but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil .</s>

<s>nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies .</s>

<s>they germinate quickly , the tiny plants appearing in a week , and grow along lustily .</s>

<s>it doesn't really matter which month of the year you sow them , but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature , very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours .</s>

<s>I like to make a seedbed right in the open , though many people start them successfully in cold frames .</s>

<s>pansies don't have to be coddled ;
they'd rather have things rugged , with only moderate protection on the coldest days .</s>

<s>if you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate .</s>

<s>for my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting .</s>

<s>I dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray .</s>

<s>then I cover the sowing with a board .</s>

<s>this keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds .</s>

<s>ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby .</s>

<s>when the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board .</s>

<s>a light , porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth .</s>

<s>I like sawdust for this , or hay .</s>

<s>when they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants , it's time to set them out where they are to remain .</s>

<s>every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller .</s>

<s>the moral is : don't transplant it any oftener than you must .</s>

<s>as soon as they are large enough to move , I put mine 9 inches apart where they are to bloom .</s>

<s>I put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into each hole with the plant .</s>

<s>that encourages rooting , and the better developed the roots , the larger and more plentiful the flowers .</s>

<s>pansies are gluttons .</s>

<s>I doubt if it is possible to overfeed them .</s>

<s>I spade lots of compost into their bed ;
lacking that , decayed manure spread over the bed is fine .</s>

<s>one year I simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile , to which a little sand had been added , and I had the most beautiful pansies in my , or any of my neighbors' experience .</s>

<s>in addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every other week , diluted to the color of weak tea .</s>

<s>as a substitute for this , organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions , may be used .</s>

<s>they need mulch .</s>

<s>we put a light mulch over the seedlings ;
now we must use a heavy one .</s>

<s>three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool .</s>

<s>when winter comes be ready with additional mulch .</s>

<s>I like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost .</s>

<s>that keeps in the cold , retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing .</s>

<s>don't miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter .</s>

<s>whenever there is a thaw or a few sunny days , you'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two .</s>

<s>if those aren't enough for you , why not grow some just for winter blooming ?</s>

<s>the pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February during a particularly cold winter .</s>

<s>I started the seed in a flat in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame .</s>

<s>( an unheated greenhouse would have been better , if I had had one .
)</s>

<s>the plants took zero nights in their stride , with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them .</s>

<s>in response to the lengthening days of February they budded , then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers .</s>

<s>that cold frame was my morale builder ;
its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it .</s>

<s>like strawberries in December , pansies are far more exciting in February than in May .</s>

<s>try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it .</s>

<s>the day will come , in midsummer , when you find your plants becoming leggy , running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms .</s>

<s>try pegging down each separate branch to the earth , using a bobby pin to hold it there .</s>

<s>pick the flowers , keep the soil dampened , and each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season .</s>

<s>as soon as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken over , cut it off from the mother plant .</s>

<s>a second and also good practice is to shear off the tops , leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch .</s>

<s>these cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring .</s>

<s>I like to shear half my plants at a time , leaving one half of them to blossom while the second half is getting started on its new round of blooming .</s>

<s>probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed .</s>

<s>nature's aim , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation .</s>

<s>that done , her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant .</s>

<s>here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds .</s>

<s>go to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy specialist .</s>

<s>it is no harder to raise big , healthy , blooming plants than weak , sickly little things ;
in fact it is easier .</s>

<s>but you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow .</s>

<s>many people think that pansies last only a few weeks , then their period of growth and bloom is over .</s>

<s>that is not true .</s>

<s>if the plants are cared for and protected over the winter , the second year is more prolific than the first .</s>

<s>would you like to grow exhibition pansies ?</s>

<s>remove about half the branches from each plant , leaving only the strongest with the largest buds .</s>

<s>the flowers will be huge .</s>

<s>pansies have character .</s>

<s>they stick to their principles , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it .</s>

<s>treat them right and they'll make a showing every month in the year except the frigid ones .</s>

<s>give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty .</s>

<s>a salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special .</s>

<s>this delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocados anywhere in the United States .</s>

<s>it has a great many assets to recommend it and if you haven't made avocado a part of your diet yet , you really should .</s>

<s>you will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted .</s>

<s>it is roughly shaped like a large pear , and when properly ripened , its dark green skin covers a meaty , melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe Bartlett pear , but oily .</s>

<s>the avocado should have a give to it , as you hold it , when it is ripe .</s>

<s>the flavor is neither sweet , like a pear , nor tart like an orange ;
it is subtle and rather bland , nut-like .</s>

<s>it is a flavor that might take a little getting used to -- not because it is unpleasant , but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits .</s>

<s>sometimes it takes several eatings of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world .</s>

<s>once you become an avocado fan , you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation .</s>

<s>naturally dormant and no spray danger
today , refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world .</s>

<s>the fruit is allowed to mature on the tree , but it is still firm at this point .</s>

<s>it is brought to packing houses , cleaned and graded as to size and quality , and packed in protective excelsior .</s>

<s>the fruit is then cooled to 42-degrees-F. , a temperature at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state .</s>

<s>this cooling does not change the avocado in any way , it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grovelike temperature ( room temperature ) is restored .</s>

<s>this happens on the grocer's shelf or in your kitchen .</s>

<s>one of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind .</s>

<s>there is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed .</s>

<s>if the temperature is controlled properly , the avocado will delay its ripening until needed .</s>

<s>and unlike other fruits , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado .</s>

<s>it is thick , much like an egg plant's skin , so that poison sprays , if they are used , present no hazard to the consumer .</s>

<s>nutritious and a cholesterol reducer
good taste and versatility , plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its nutritional values were limited .</s>

<s>avocados , however , are very rich in nutrients .</s>

<s>their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids , so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system .</s>

<s>aside from this , the average portion contains some protein , an appreciable amount of vitamins J and J -- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement , and about a third of the official vitamin J requirement .</s>

<s>the J vitamins are well represented , especially thiamin and riboflavin .</s>

<s>calcium , phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts , and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts .</s>

<s>none of these values is destroyed , not significantly altered by refrigeration storage .</s>

<s>Dr. Wilson C. Grant , of the Veterans' Administration Hospital , Coral Gables , Florida , and the University of Miami School of Medicine , set out to discover if avocados , because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids , would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients .</s>

<s>the study comprised 16 male patients , ranging in age from 27 to 72 .</s>

<s>they were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible , the normal cholesterol level of their blood .</s>

<s>then they were given 1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption .</s>

the tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard .</s>

<s>the pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach .</s>

<s>never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much apprehension and fear .</s>

<s>nuclear weapons are fearsome , but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much more terrifying .</s>

<s>a great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets .</s>

<s>it is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker , in possession of such absolute power , would simultaneously destroy his opponent's cities and people .</s>

<s>with a nation defenseless before it , why would the attacker spare the victim's people ?</s>

<s>wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation ?</s>

<s>the nation would be utterly devastated .</s>

<s>the will of its people , so crucial in time of peril , would be broken .</s>

<s>nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days ;
and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes .</s>

<s>at this point it should be painfully obvious that cities , being soft , and the people within them are ideally suited to destruction by nuclear weapons .</s>

<s>however , because this vulnerability is mutual , it is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the opponent's cities , at least so long as the opponent has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal .</s>

<s>it should be appallingly apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic .</s>

<s>ICBMs have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways .</s>

<s>they could be used to attack a nation's people ( which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker's own people ) , or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military force .</s>

<s>if our national interest lies in being able to fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide , then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles .</s>

<s>we must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves .</s>

<s>we must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile .</s>

<s>missiles are very valuable weapons , but they also have their too little known limitations .</s>

<s>because of a missile's ballistic trajectory , the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately .</s>

<s>placing missiles in submarines , on barges , railroads , highways , surface vessels and in the air provides them with passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range ballistic missiles today -- the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving target with such weapons .</s>

<s>one must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target , decide that it is worthy of destruction , select the missile to be fired against the target , compute ballistics for the flight , and prepare the missile for firing .</s>

<s>even if all these operations could be performed instantaneously , the J still has a time of flight to the target of about 30 minutes .</s>

<s>therefore , if the target can significantly change its location in something less than 30 minutes , the probability of having destroyed it is drastically lowered .</s>

<s>because of this , it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek self-protection in mobility -- at least until missile defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability .</s>

<s>in order to destroy the enemy's mobile , moving , or imprecisely located strategic forces , we must have a hunter-killer capability in addition to our missiles .</s>

<s>until this hunter-killer operation can be performed by spacecraft , manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us .</s>

<s>it seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's citizens to cinders , we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance aircraft capable of going into China or Russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us .</s>

<s>let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail-mobile J force .</s>

<s>it is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the J or J in hunter-killer operations against Soviet railway-based missiles .</s>

<s>if we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets , it would seem that the J or J could carry a great many small nuclear weapons .</s>

<s>an aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains operating within a specified geographic area of Russia -- provided that we had used some of our J to degrade Russia's air defenses before our bombers got there .</s>

<s>the aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile , fleeting , and imprecisely located targets as well as the known , fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile .</s>

<s>why , then , aren't we planning a larger , more important role for manned military aircraft ?</s>

<s>is there any other way to do the job ?</s>

<s>survivability of our strategic forces ( Polaris , mobile and hardened Minuteman , hardened Atlas and Titan , and airborne Skybolt ) means that it will take some time , perhaps weeks , to destroy a strategic force .</s>

<s>war , under these circumstances , cannot be one massive exchange of nuclear devastation .</s>

<s>forces will survive a surprise attack , and these forces will give depth , or considerable duration , to the conflict .</s>

<s>the forces which survive the initial attack must be found and destroyed .</s>

<s>even mobile forces must be found and destroyed .</s>

<s>but , how does one go about the job of finding and destroying mobile forces ?</s>

<s>they are not susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile .</s>

<s>some day , many years in the future , true spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets .</s>

<s>but until we have an effective spacecraft , the answer to the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft .</s>

<s>however , the aircraft which we have today are tied to large , soft airfields .</s>

<s>nuclear rockets can destroy airfields with ease .</s>

<s>here then is our problem : aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable of performing ;
but the airfield , on which the aircraft is completely dependent , is doomed by the missile .</s>

<s>this makes today's aircraft a one-shot , or one mission , weapon .</s>

<s>aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once .</s>

<s>this is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft in favor of the missile .</s>

<s>but remember this -- it isn't the aircraft which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets , it is the airfield .</s>

<s>eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic missiles .</s>

<s>there are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground : put aircraft in bomb-proof hangars when they are on the ground .</s>

<s>build long-range aircraft which can take off from small ( 3,000-foot ) airfields with runways .</s>

<s>if we could use all the small airfields we have in this country , we could disperse our strategic aircraft by a factor of 10 or more .</s>

<s>use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life .</s>

<s>using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines , develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing ( VTOL ) long-range military aircraft .</s>

<s>we have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 J .</s>

<s>we could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters .</s>

<s>large , long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability to take off from 3,000-foot runways , but they would require more powerful engines than we have today .</s>

<s>there is little enthusiasm for spending money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile .</s>

<s>this same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft .</s>

<s>one seldom hears the analogy nuclear propulsion will do for the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine .</s>

<s>if , for some reason such as economy , we are not going to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency , then we should turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 12 or 15 to one .</s>

<s>with powerplants such as these , vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft could be built .</s>

<s>for example , a 12-to-one engine would power a supersonic J fighter .</s>

<s>with a 15-to-one engine , a supersonic aircraft weighing 300,000 pounds could rise vertically .</s>

<s>the reason that we are not going ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a billion dollars -- and you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft are obsolete .</s>

<s>when aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields , they are no longer vulnerable to J .</s>

<s>if our J bombers were , today , capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability to strike at Russia again , and again , and again , those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance .</s>

<s>we would have the means to seek out and destroy the enemy's force -- whether it were fixed or mobile .</s>

<s>with such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy , and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminating .</s>

<s>no need to kill an entire city and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance to selectively disarm the enemy's military force .</s>

<s>our first necessity , at the very outset of war , is post-attack reconnaissance .</s>

<s>in a few years we will have J ( semiautomatic missile observation system ) .</s>

<s>but in the case of moving targets , and targets which have limited mobility , what will their location be when it is time to destroy them ?</s>

<s>what targets have we successfully knocked out ?</s>

<s>a ballistic missile cannot , today , tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful .</s>

<s>what targets still remain to be hit ?</s>

<s>these crucial questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance .</s>

<s>SAMOS will be hard put to see through clouds -- and to see in the dark .</s>

<s>even if this is some day possible , there remains the 30-minute time of flight of a missile to its overseas target .</s>

<s>if the target can change its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on its way , the probability of the missile destroying the target is drastically reduced .</s>

<s>pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably .</s>

<s>it would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance .</s>

<s>it could operate under the clouds and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night .</s>

<s>it would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered -- no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from the United States with the chance that the target , if it were mobile , would be gone .</s>

<s>a large aircraft , such as the J or J , could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear weapons .</s>

<s>few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive power will create 1,000 J overpressure at 100 feet .</s>

<s>or put another way , the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed by placing a one-kiloton warhead ( 1/20th the size of those used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki ) within 100 to 200 feet of the target ]
it is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large yield nuclear weapons .</s>

<s>today we have side-looking radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings , runways , taxi-ways , separate spans of bridges , etc.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>with these keen eyes and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy , military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage to urban areas .</s>

<s>if we fail to develop the means to hunt down and destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care and precision , and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace , our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening .</s>

<s>the lyric beauties of Schubert's Trout Quintet -- its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies -- make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners .</s>

<s>but for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems .</s>

<s>since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music -- yet it calls for a double bass , an instrument generally regarded as symphonic .</s>

<s>moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor .</s>

<s>the many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing .</s>

<s>some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free rein .</s>

<s>other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation .</s>

<s>in these readings , the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown's attire -- the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop .</s>

<s>recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances .</s>

<s>the occasion for this marathon : Angel's long-awaited reissue in its Great Recordings Of The Century series of the Schnabel-Pro Arte version .</s>

<s>let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first .</s>

<s>whether considered alone or in relation to other editions , J 40 is a document of prime importance .</s>

<s>Artur Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart players of all time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable .</s>

<s>but Schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils ( Clifford Curzon , Frank Glazer , Adrian Aeschbacher , and Victor Babin ) also sheds light on the master's pedagogical skills .</s>

<s>certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the Schnabel trill ( which differs from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) .</s>

<s>but the most impressive testimony to Schnabel's distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student's approach as distinctly his own .</s>

<s>Schnabel's emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one .</s>

<s>yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity .</s>

<s>this is a serious-minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced .</s>

<s>and although Schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications .</s>

<s>the piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives .</s>

<s>about the Pro Arte's contribution I am less happy .</s>

<s>I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel didn't collaborate with the Budapest Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group .</s>

<s>from a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the Pro Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here .</s>

<s>the violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy .</s>

<s>the twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet .</s>

<s>there is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the Forellen movement , and I suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original J .</s>

<s>turning to the more modern versions , Curzon's ( London ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work .</s>

<s>every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought out , and of these I would especially cite the delicious laendler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout .</s>

<s>some of Curzon's playing strikes me as finicky , however .</s>

<s>why , for example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ?</s>

<s>the assisting musicians from the Vienna Octet are somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution is rustic and appealing .</s>

<s>( special compliments to the double bass playing of Johann Krumpp : his scrawny , tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance .
)</s>

<s>the Glazer-Fine Arts edition ( Concert-Disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization .</s>

<s>it is , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort .</s>

<s>but having lived with the disc for some time now , I find the performance less exciting than either Schnabel's or Fleisher's ( whose superb performance with the Budapest Quartet has still to be recorded ) and a good deal less filled with humor than Curzon's .</s>

<s>Aeschbacher's work is very much akin to Schnabel's , but the sound on his Decca disc is dated , and you will have a hard time locating a copy of it .</s>

<s>the Hephzibah Menuhin-Amadeus Quartet ( Angel ) and Victor Babin-Festival Quartet ( RCA Victor ) editions give us superlative string playing ( both in symphonic style ) crippled by unimaginative piano playing .</s>

<s>( Babin has acquired some of Schnabel's keyboard manner , but his playing is of limited insight .
)</s>

<s>Badura-Skoda-Vienna Konzerthaus ( Westminster ) and Demus-Schubert Quartet ( Deutsche Grammophon ) are both warm-toned , pleasantly lyrical , but rather slack and tensionless .</s>

<s>Helmut Roloff , playing with a group of musicians from the Bayreuth Ensemble , gives a sturdy reading , in much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists .</s>

<s>Telefunken has accorded him beautiful sound , and this bargain-priced disc ( it sells for $2.98 ) is worthy of consideration .</s>

<s>returning once again to the Schnabel reissue , I am beguiled anew by the magnificence of this pianist's musical penetration .</s>

<s>here is truly a Great Recording of the Century , and its greatness is by no means diminished by the fact that it is not quite perfect .</s>

<s>this recording surely belongs in everyone's collection .</s>

<s>must records always sound like records ?</s>

<s>from the beginning of commercial recording , new discs purported to be indistinguishable from The Real Thing have regularly been put in circulation .</s>

<s>seen in perspective , many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones .</s>

<s>although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original .</s>

<s>on the basis of what they give us we can know how the young Caruso sang , appreciate the distinctive qualities of Parsifal under Karl Muck's baton , or sense the type of ensemble Toscanini created in his years with the New York Philharmonic .</s>

<s>since the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold .</s>

<s>in many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational effects : the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance became clearer .</s>

<s>other innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of classics .</s>

<s>if we return to them today , we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing .</s>

<s>records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music .</s>

<s>this difference is made up of many factors .</s>

<s>some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings .</s>

<s>( music often sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat .
)</s>

<s>from the technical standpoint , records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original .</s>

<s>any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests .</s>

<s>yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness , that makes records sound like records .</s>

<s>the sound may be good ;
but if you know The Real Thing , you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation .</s>

<s>Command's new Brahms Second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one .</s>

<s>like the recent Scheherazade from London ( High Fidelity , Sept. 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than on creating sensational effects .</s>

<s>because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers' triumph .</s>

<s>the easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values .</s>

<s>the engineering as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness .</s>

<s>the effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance .</s>

<s>this absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue .</s>

<s>a contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained .</s>

<s>the orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental to playing .</s>

<s>yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall .</s>

<s>Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation .</s>

<s>the music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full sonority ;
yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer .</s>

<s>the timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance .</s>

<s>all of this would be wasted , of course , if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction .</s>

<s>for me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors .</s>

<s>Steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score , discounting tradition , and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what Brahms set down on paper .</s>

<s>those accustomed to broader , more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one .</s>

<s>without losing the distinctive undertow of Brahmsian rhythm , the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect .</s>

<s>the Presto Ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you , as the real Allegro con Spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet .</s>

<s>in the end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings .</s>

<s>Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manages at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song .</s>

<s>the engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result .</s>

<s>too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment .</s>

<s>the Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration .</s>

<s>your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score .</s>

<s>it is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener .</s>

<s>the first substantially complete stereo Giselle ( and the only one of its scope since Feyer's four-sided J edition of 1958 for Angel ) , this set is , I'm afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment .</s>

<s>the already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari's melodramatic contrasts between ultravehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality .</s>

<s>and in its engineers' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sounds as though it had been doctored for super-high fidelity .</s>

<s>the home listener is overpowered , all right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one .</s>

<s>as with the penultimate Giselle release ( Wolff's abridgment for RCA Victor ) I find the cleaner , less razor-edged monophonic version , for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness , the more aurally tolerable -- but this may be the result of processing defects in my J copies .</s>

<s>at the Westminster J Dog Show in Madison Square Garden , New York on the second day , the Finals of the Junior Class brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this Class .</s>

<s>the Class had entries from as far west as Wisconsin and as far south as Kentucky .</s>

<s>this year several entries from Canada were entered which made the Junior Class International .</s>

<s>forty-six of the 53 Juniors who mailed in entries were present .</s>

<s>it was interesting to note that many of these Juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the Finals of the Junior Class .</s>

<s>as has been the custom for the past several years , John Cross , Jr. , Bench Show Chmn.</s>

<s>of Westminster , arranged for the Juniors' meeting before the Class , and invited two speakers from the dog world to address them .</s>

<s>over 60 Juniors , parents and guests attended .</s>

<s>Mrs. William H. Long , Jr. speaks
after the Juniors were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the Finals of the Junior Class , Mrs. William H. Long , Jr. was introduced as the first speaker .</s>

<s>in her opening remarks Mrs. Long also welcomed the Juniors and stated , there isn't any other show quite like Westminster .</s>

<s>I know because this is my 37th year with hardly a break .</s>

<s>Mrs. Long still feels the same unique spirit of Westminster which she stated the present Juniors will experience today but probably will not appreciate in full for a number of years .</s>

<s>twenty years ago her daughter Betsey Long , then 13 years of age , won the Grand Challenge Trophy , Children's Handling Class ( as they were called then ) at Westminster .</s>

<s>no sooner had Betsey come out of the ring than Mrs. Long walked into the Working Competition with Ch.</s>

<s>Cadet or Noranda , another home-bred product , and won ]
speaking from long years of experience , Mrs. Long advised the Juniors : when showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement , stop ]
dogs have a way of sensing our feelings ]

<s>if you walk into the ring because it is fun to show your dog , he will feel it and give you a good performance ]
he knows your signals , what is expected of him and the way the Class is conducted , right up through the flash-bulbs of the photographers .</s>

<s>right attitude essential ]

take away your attitude , said Mrs. Long , and what have you left ?</s>

<s>either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage -- a sure sign that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop ]
or a bored dog because you are more interested in something else -- maybe the way you look , or the date you have after the Class , or you are just doing this to please the parents .</s>

<s>the reason you are in the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can produce .</s>

<s>aids sounds more like a Pony Club , or horsemanship classes -- riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar ]
your aids are your attitude , which comes through your voice , your hands and legs -- voice to encourage , discourage or whatever the need may be ;
hands to guide or restrain ;
legs to produce motion and rate of speed .</s>

<s>without right attitude the other aids just do not work right .</s>

<s>Mrs. Long wished all the Juniors luck in the Class and stated , have fun ]
and may you all continue to show at Westminster in the years to come ]
Harvey Barcus , second speaker
the second speaker was Harvey Barcus , President of the Dog Writers Ass'n of America .</s>

<s>Mr. Barcus spoke on the subject of scholarships for Juniors -- with which he is very familiar .</s>

<s>last year a boy he knows and helped in Journalism won the Thoroughbred Racing Ass'n Scholarship which is worth $10,000 .</s>

<s>he gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship .</s>

<s>Junior Showmanship is an extremely worthy project and should be earnestly encouraged ]

<s>Westminster Show Notes
instead of 3 a.m. in the past , the Juniors Class at Westminster was held at 4:45 p.m. .</s>

<s>this gave the Juniors the use of the entire ring at the show -- a great advantage to them ]
before the Juniors entered the ring the Steward announced that after all Juniors had moved their dogs around the ring and set them up , they could relax with their dogs .</s>

<s>from there on , each Junior was going to be judged individually .</s>

<s>this thoughtful gesture was well received by the Juniors as the Class had an entry of 46 Juniors and it took approximately one hour , 45 minutes to judge the Class .</s>

<s>Anne Hone Rogers judges 28th finals
this year Anne Hone Rogers , outstanding Handler , judged the Class .</s>

<s>this is the third time in 28 years of Junior Showmanship at Westminster that a lady Handler has judged the Class .</s>

<s>as the Juniors entered the ring , Mr. Spring , the announcer , stated over the public-address system that this was the 28th year that Westminster has held the Finals of the Junior Competition .</s>

<s>Juniors competed last year at American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club , recognized shows to be eligible to compete in this Class -- the Finals for the year .</s>

<s>a Junior who won two or more wins in the Open Class was eligible .</s>

<s>( the purpose of the Junior Showmanship Competition is to teach and encourage Juniors to become good sportsmen .</s>

<s>many adults showing at Westminster today are products of this Class .
)</s>

<s>it seemed an almost impossible job for Miss Rogers to select 4 winners from the 46 Juniors entered .</s>

<s>a large number of these Juniors have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners .</s>

<s>after the judge moved all the dogs individually , she selected several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring .</s>

<s>she then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship .</s>

<s>International Champion of the year
Betty Lou Ham , age 16 , Holyoke , Mass.</s>

<s>, showing an Irish Setter , was chosen as International Champion of the year .</s>

<s>she was awarded the Professional Handlers' Ass'ns' Leonard Brumby , Sr. Memorial Trophy ( named for the founder-originator of the Junior Classes .

<s>Betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to her credit last year .</s>

<s>in addition to showing an Irish Setter throughout the year , she also scored with an Afghan .</s>

<s>other winners

<s>Susan Hackmann , age 14 , from Baltimore , Md.</s>

<s>, showing a Dachshund , was 3rd .</s>

<s>from the records we keep -- Susan is the only Junior who has placed in the Junior Classes in both United States and Canada .</s>

<s>Karen Marcmann , age 16 , Trapp , Penna.</s>

<s>, showing a Keeshond was 4th .</s>

<s>most Juniors who were entered in the Finals are seasoned campaigners and not only show and win in Junior Classes but score in the Breed Classes as well .</s>

<s>entries increasing -- requirements raised

<s>next year 1962 , at Westminster , the Bench Show Committee has raised the requirements so that a junior must win 3 or more Junior Classes in the open division only to qualify for Westminster .</s>

<s>Percy Roberts , a leading judge will not be at the International Show this year for the Junior Judging Contest as he has been invited to judge in Australia in March .</s>

<s>judging class for intermediates proposed

<s>for some time this writer has been suggesting a Junior Judging Class for Intermediates over 16 and under 20 years of age who are ineligible to compete in the Junior Class .</s>

<s>such a Class was tried out successfully at the Westchester J Show recently .</s>

<s>not only were the contestants pleased with the Class , but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day .</s>

<s>the Intermediates in the Class with the Judge were asked to pick 4 winners and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice of the Judge .</s>

<s>we suggested this Class in the horse world and it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows .</s>

<s>at the recent horse show convention in New York it was stated that this Intermediate Judging Class is meeting with great success and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world .</s>

<s>this Class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given a chance .</s>

<s>last year Robert Harris , a leading Junior Handler entered the Dog Judging Contest ( Junior ) at the International J of Chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any Junior since the Class' inception .</s>

<s>juniors who attend this Chicago show should make a point to enter this Class as it would be of great help to them .</s>

<s>more volunteer handlers needed to judge

<s>the founder of the Junior Showmanship Competition the late Leonard Brumby , Sr. ( whom the trophy is named after at Westminster ) was an outstanding Handler and believed a Junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting with the Junior Showmanship Division .</s>

<s>some years ago this Class was judged by celebrities who knew nothing of what was required of a Junior's ability to show a dog .</s>

<s>to overcome this unfair judging , the A.K.C.</s>

<s>requires that a licensed Handler be present to judge the Class .</s>

<s>if the superintendents do not receive more cooperation from Handlers , it has been suggested that licensed Judges also be qualified to judge this Class .</s>

<s>by recognizing and helping Juniors get interested in the dog world , all will be helping to create future dog owners .</s>

<s>at one time , to most Americans , unless they were fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water , boats were considered the sole concern of fishermen , rich people , and the United States Navy .</s>

<s>today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport .</s>

<s>there are more than 8,000,000 recreational boats in use in the United States with almost 10,000,000 the prediction for within the next decade .</s>

<s>about 40,000,000 people participated in boating in 1960 .</s>

<s>boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea .</s>

<s>boats are operated in every state in the Union , with the heaviest concentrations along both coasts and in the Middle West .</s>

<s>the spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident , expectedly , in the areas where boats have always been found : the natural lakes , rivers , and along the nation's coastline .</s>

<s>but during the last several years boats were launched in areas where , a short time ago , the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for livestock .</s>

<s>developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources control program of the government , vast , man-made bodies of water represent a kind of glorious fringe benefit , providing boating and fishing havens all over the country .</s>

<s>no matter how determined or wealthy boating lovers of the Southwest had been , for example , they could never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile Lake Texoma , located between Texas and Oklahoma , which resulted when the Corp of Army Engineers dammed the Red River .</s>

<s>in 1959 , according to the Engineers , Lake Texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1,000,000 persons .</s>

<s>where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been created by bringing bodies of water to the people , means have been found to take the people and their boats to the water .</s>

<s>providing these means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1,800,000 boat trailers now in use .</s>

<s>it is a simple task to haul a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new , light , strong , easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2,000 .</s>

<s>the sight of sleek inboards , outboards , and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways many miles from any water is commonplace .</s>

<s>boatmen lucky enough to have facilities for year-'round anchorage for their craft , will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car , driving to the water , and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to the boat .</s>

<s>today , the boat , on its trailer , is brought to the gear and loaded at the door .</s>

<s>arriving at the waterside , the boat is launched , the family taken aboard and , that easily , another day afloat is begun .</s>

<s>and trailers for boats are not what they started out to be ten years ago .</s>

<s>this year , Americans will discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred of our nation's national , regional and local boat shows .</s>

<s>the boats of America's trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as they are hauled to new horizons .</s>

<s>the variety of craft on the country's waters today is overwhelming .</s>

<s>they range from an eight-foot pram , which you can build yourself for less than $50 , to auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $100,000 .</s>

<s>boat prices vary according to the buyer's desires or needs .</s>

<s>in this respect , boats can be compared with houses .</s>

<s>there is no limit to what you can spend , yet it is easily possible to keep within a set budget .</s>

<s>there is no question as to just what is available .</s>

<s>you name it , our industry is producing it , and it probably is made in different models .</s>

<s>there are canoes ideal for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips .</s>

<s>there are houseboats which are literally homes afloat , accommodating whole families in comfort and convenience .</s>

<s>you can cross an ocean in a fully equipped craft , sail , power , or both , or laze away a fine day in a small dinghy on a local pond .</s>

<s>you may have your boat of wood , canvas , plywood , plastic , or metal .</s>

<s>you may order utility models , inboard or outboard , with or without toilets , galleys , and bunks .</s>

<s>you may dress it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose .</s>

<s>designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly Pasadena lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around the block , to the sportiest boatman who insists on all the dash , color , flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat .</s>

<s>you pay your money and you take your choice .</s>

<s>American technology in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful interest in American boating .</s>

<s>I wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors , Americans excel over any country in the world in the long run .</s>

<s>Russia , whose technology is not quite primitive , is still in the dark ages when it comes to improving the outboard motor , for instance .</s>

<s>now here is truly a marvel .</s>

<s>the outboard engine of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower , unheard of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production .</s>

<s>these engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease , wherein lies their greatest advantage .</s>

<s>their cost is not beyond the hopes of the American pocketbook , the range being about $150 to $1,000 , depending on size .</s>

<s>great thought has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population of the country ;
and to making the owning of a boat simpler .</s>

<s>there was a time when , if a man wanted to purchase a boat , it was necessary for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he could touch the tiller or wheel .</s>

<s>having a boat financed through a local bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended .</s>

<s>marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later .</s>

<s>terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down payments run about the same as for automobiles .</s>

<s>of course , individual financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser's earning power , credit rating and local bank policy .</s>

<s>outboard motors , insurance , and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as boats .</s>

<s>terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home appliances .</s>

<s>when the automobile was in its embryonic stage , such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about the only rule governing where , when and how fast a car could go .</s>

<s>when air travel was in its infancy , the sky was considered big enough and high enough for all .</s>

<s>man had enough to worry about managing to get up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft .</s>

<s>it was much the same with pleasure boating at first .</s>

<s>come one , come all , the water's fine ]
as the ungoverned days of the automobile and the airplane are long since relegated to the past , so is the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do ;
must and should do .</s>

<s>however , there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating .</s>

<s>laws on boating vary according to the state in which the craft is to be used and according to its horsepower .</s>

<s>what may be acceptable in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line .</s>

<s>the main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally used .</s>

<s>if your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure boats , you must apply for a number from the U.S. Coast Guard for any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower before it can be used on Federal waterways .</s>

<s>state numbering laws differ from each other in many ways .</s>

<s>fees are not the same and some states do not require certain craft , such as sailboats with no power , to be registered at all .</s>

<s>many states have laws regulating the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age of motor boat operators .</s>

<s>generally , states reserve for communities the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities .</s>

<s>it is always wise to consult your marine dealer , local yacht or boat club secretary , or local law enforcement officers if you are not positive what the regulations are .</s>

<s>ignorance of the law is no better excuse on the water than it is on land ;
lack of ability and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy .</s>

<s>hand in hand with the legislative program is the industry's self originated and directed safety program .</s>

<s>foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the rapid growth of the sport , the industry has been supporting an intense , coordinated educational program with great success since 1947 .</s>

<s>a primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers .</s>

<s>the industry has been its own watch dog .</s>

<s>with U.S. Coast Guard cooperation , the American Boat and Yacht Council was formed to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference to safety .</s>

<s>industry interest in safety goes even farther .</s>

<s>in 1959 , the Yacht Safety Bureau was reorganized by the National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and their equipment .</s>

<s>a new waterfront site for the bureau is now being built at Atlantic City , New Jersey , to provide the most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the sport safe .</s>

<s>in addition to these activities , the J , with headquarters at 420 Lexington Avenue , New York City , as well as other associations and individual manufacturers , provide and distribute films , booklets , and public services in regard to proper boat handling and safety afloat .</s>

<s>it is important to note the work of the United States Power Squadrons and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary .</s>

<s>each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in seamanship piloting and small boat handling .</s>

<s>these are not governmentally subsidized organizations .</s>

<s>this year , over 100,000 persons will receive this free instruction .</s>

<s>as America on wheels was responsible for an industry of motor courts , motels , and drive-in establishments where you can dine , see a movie , shop , or make a bank deposit , the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate them .</s>

<s>instead of motels , for the boatman there are marinas .</s>

<s>the word marina was coined by J originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative comfort .</s>

<s>currently , marina is used to indicate a municipal or commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and find some or all of the following available : gasoline , fresh water , electricity , telephone service , ice , repair facilities , restaurants , sleeping accommodations , a general store , and a grocery store .</s>

<s>yachtel , a relatively new word , indicates a waterfront type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises as well as other services .</s>

<s>boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel .</s>

<s>it indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as outboards .</s>

<s>regardless of nomenclature , yachtels and boatels are marinas .</s>

<s>boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities may rightfully be called marinas .</s>

<s>a recent survey disclosed there are about 4,000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and boatyards in the United States , the majority of which are equipped to handle outboard boats .</s>

<s>the design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle , but once understood , the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement .</s>

<s>in the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves .</s>

<s>the main set of bars are the tappets and one tappet is connected to each lever .</s>

<s>if the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch , the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time .</s>

<s>close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars .</s>

<s>these can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets .</s>

<s>the number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented .</s>

<s>in the sides of the tappets are notches with sloping sides , and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist of cams called dogs .</s>

<s>two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar .</s>

<s>these slide into and out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are moved , locking and unlocking them .</s>

<s>here's how the scheme works : suppose the operator pulls the lever to clear a particular signal .</s>

<s>this also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side , thus moving one or more locking bars .</s>

<s>the dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other tappets .</s>

<s>interlocking signals are normally at stop or red position , and a lever must be pulled to clear the signal .</s>

<s>this is not necessarily to green , however , for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the plant .</s>

<s>there are other basic rules .</s>

<s>a turnout may have two levers , one to actually move the switch points , the other to lock the points .</s>

<s>a signal cannot be cleared until all the related turnouts are properly thrown and locked .</s>

<s>such locks are nearly always used where the switch points face oncoming traffic .</s>

<s>the lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point .</s>

<s>if the points aren't thrown all the way , the Turnout cannot be locked , and in turn , the signal cannot be cleared .</s>

<s>generally , these locks on turnouts are called facing point locks .</s>

<s>scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics .</s>

<s>without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round would not have any means of analyzing , standardizing , and communicating the things they discover and learn .</s>

<s>math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor .</s>

<s>hot rodding is a science .</s>

<s>it's not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is , nevertheless , a science .</s>

<s>but because science is based on mathematics doesn't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician .</s>

<s>a guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems ;
however , he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding .</s>

<s>a mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem .</s>

<s>it places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed .</s>

<s>the first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula .</s>

<s>this changes the formula to an equation .</s>

<s>the equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem .</s>

<s>equations for rodding formulas are not complicated .</s>

<s>they involve only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic classes .</s>

<s>however , it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order .</s>

<s>they indicate simple division , multiplication , subtraction , and addition .</s>

<s>the symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other .</s>

<s>the lower number is always divided into the upper number : F .</s>

<s>the symbol for multiplication is J .</s>

<s>it is used to separate two or more numbers in a row .</s>

<s>for example : F .</s>

<s>numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order .</s>

<s>the result will be the same regardless of the order used .</s>

<s>the symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign .</s>

<s>this is nothing more than a dash .</s>

<s>it separates two or more numbers .</s>

<s>the number on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on the left of the symbol .</s>

<s>for example : F .</s>

<s>when more than two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct .</s>

<s>for example , for the problem F , 10 from 25 equals 15 , then 6 from 15 equals 9 .</s>

<s>addition is indicated by the + symbol .</s>

<s>the symbol is used to separate two or more numbers .</s>

<s>for example : F .</s>

<s>numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order .</s>

<s>when solving an equation that involves division as well as other steps , do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical value .</s>

<s>multiplication , subtraction , and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward the right .</s>

<s>completing the division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication , subtraction , or addition steps : F .</s>

<s>this would be reduced by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12 .</s>

<s>this part of the equation would then become 4 .</s>

<s>for use in formulas , fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents .</s>

<s>the easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart .</s>

<s>charts for this purpose are available from many sources .</s>

<s>they are included in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision measuring instruments .</s>

<s>the various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places .</s>

<s>shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result .</s>

<s>some formulas contain constants .</s>

<s>a constant is a number that remains the same regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation .</s>

<s>it is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly .</s>

<s>rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport .</s>

<s>the answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases and , quite often , are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events .</s>

<s>when it is needed , one formula is as important as another .</s>

<s>however , some formulas are used more than others .</s>

<s>we'll take them in the general order of their popularity .</s>

<s>engine displacement
a rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine .</s>

<s>displacement is sometimes referred to as swept volume .</s>

<s>most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions .</s>

<s>it is good to be able to compute displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking can be computed .</s>

<s>factors involved in the displacement formula are the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders , the length of the piston stroke , the number of cylinders in the engine , and a constant .</s>

<s>the constant is .7854 , which is one-quarter of 3.1416 , another constant known as pi .</s>

<s>pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles .</s>

<s>actually , the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the engine .</s>

<s>the cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying the area by the stroke length , which is the equivalent of the length of the cylinders .</s>

<s>multiplying the result by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the engine's total displacement .</s>

<s>the formula is : F .</s>

<s>dimensions in inches , and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches .</s>

<s>dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters ( cc. )</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>one inch equals 2.54 centimeters : one cubic inch equals 16.38 cubic centimeters .</s>

<s>for example , let's consider a standard 283 cubic inch Chevy J .</s>

<s>these engines have a cylinder diameter of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches .</s>

<s>the formula , with the fractions converted to decimals , becomes F .</s>

<s>to arrive at the answer , multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right .</s>

<s>the different steps will look like this : F .</s>

<s>compression ratio
a cylinder's compression ratio is computed by comparing the cylinder's volume , or its displacement , with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber .</s>

<s>cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid .</s>

<s>cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula : F .</s>

<s>to measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder head , install the valves and spark plug in the chamber and support the head so that its gasket surface is level .</s>

<s>then pour water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to its gasket surface .</s>

<s>do not overfill the chamber .</s>

<s>this is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension .</s>

<s>such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber .</s>

<s>the amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity .</s>

<s>most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters ( cc. )</s>

<s>, making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches .</s>

<s>however , the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters .</s>

<s>the compression ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are used .</s>

<s>the only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms .</s>

<s>the volume of the cylinder opening in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch .</s>

<s>sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won't affect the final computation .</s>

<s>the volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume .</s>

<s>another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is in top dead center position .</s>

<s>compute this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth .</s>

<s>the formula for this step is : F .</s>

<s>this volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening .</s>

<s>the total of these three volumes is the final combustion chamber volume .</s>

<s>after the factors just described have been computed , they are applied to the following formula : F .</s>

<s>for an example let's dream up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches .</s>

<s>applying these figures to the formula we get the equation : F .</s>

<s>the compression ratio is 10 to 1 .</s>

<s>this method of computing compression ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads .</s>

<s>any irregularity on the piston heads will make it impossible , with normal means , to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot be readily computed .</s>

<s>the only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston is in top dead center position .</s>

<s>gear ratio -- speed relationships
there are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed , engine speed , rear axle gear ratio , and rear tire size .</s>

<s>by using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three .</s>

<s>to simplify the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors .</s>

<s>these are J for car speed , J for engine crankshaft speed , J for rear axle gear ratio , J for tire size .</s>

<s>tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly .</s>

<s>this is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft .</s>

<s>a tire must be inflated to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made .</s>

<s>the measurement must be in inches .</s>

<s>any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics .</s>

<s>when tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used in the formula .</s>

<s>to determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed , gear ratio , and tire size , the formula is : F .</s>

<s>for an engine speed of 5000 J , a gear ratio of 4.00 to 1 , and a tire radius of 13 inches , the equation would look like this : F .</s>

<s>to determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is : F .</s>

<s>using the same figures as for the previous example , the equation becomes : F .</s>

<s>to determine the rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors , the formula is : F .</s>

<s>using the figures from the previous examples , the equation becomes : F .</s>

<s>the average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun ( we ran a survey to find out ) but he's always on the lookout for new and better arms .</s>

<s>he's more than a reader of outdoor articles ;
he's a real hunter and shooter , eager to improve his sport .</s>

<s>well , if you're that kind of sportsman we're here to help you .</s>

<s>you've probably given a lot of Christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack , but it's not easy to decide on a new one .</s>

<s>you still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most ;
the time to decide on them is now .</s>

<s>as a Christmas service , I've taken a close look at this year's crop of new models .</s>

<s>here they are , with my comments and judgments .</s>

<s>read on , take your pick -- and start dropping those hints .</s>

<s>first on my own list would be two arms -- a rifle and a handgun -- that qualify as new in the strictest sense .</s>

<s>for me , a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute a truly new design .</s>

<s>such modifications are all for the best but it takes something as different as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change arms-making concepts .</s>

<s>Bill Ruger's long-awaited Deerstalker ( under $110 ) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of high-velocity fans ;
it's a short , light , quick-handling , fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game -- whitetail .</s>

<s>Ruger reports that on his recent African safari the little .44 Magnum cartridge was a real work horse .</s>

<s>small antelope were generally grassed with one shot , and the .44 Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck , kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency ;
these are fairly large , tough animals .</s>

<s>the deadliness of the .44 Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me .</s>

<s>at least five years ago , Tom Robinson of Marlin made up an over/under double rifle for me in this caliber , using the now defunct Model 90 action in 20-gauge size .</s>

<s>after figuring out how to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact , we fired this little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in Marlin's underground test gallery .</s>

<s>we quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued Bill Ruger in his first experiments : three or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then , unaccountably , one could stray far out of the group .</s>

<s>Ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet .</s>

<s>the new , jacketed slug in .44 Magnum corrected this .</s>

<s>but even without jacketed bullets , I had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year .</s>

<s>within half an hour I jumped a six-point buck that hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket , and I caught him just behind the left foreleg at 60 yards .</s>

<s>he moved only about 30 feet after the 240-grain slug hit him -- and this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling .</s>

<s>three more deer have fallen to this same gun , and all were one-shot kills .</s>

<s>my double was made with standard-weight revolver barrels ( before cutting to revolver length ) , and although it compares well in other respects , it's considerably heavier than the Deerstalker , which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds .</s>

<s>if ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter , this is it .</s>

<s>the Deerstalker points with the ease , speed and precision of a fine imported double shotgun , and its trigger pull is light and sharp .</s>

<s>the 240-grain bullet leaves the muzzle at 1,850 J , which gives it all the smash needed at woods ranges .</s>

<s>with five shots at the immediate command of the hunter's trigger finger , the gun and load are a deadly combination .</s>

<s>the second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load -- the .22 Remington Jet Magnum Center Fire .</s>

<s>at present it's available in one model , the fine and familiar Smith & Wesson Magnum revolver ( about $110 ) , long a top-quality handgun among target arms .</s>

<s>the velocity of this .22-caliber , 40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2,460 J , and it's the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge , with a mid-range rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range .</s>

<s>this is a varmint load , pure and simple ;
it's much too explosive for small edible game .</s>

<s>it can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers .</s>

<s>the most intriguing aspect of the S & W Magnum chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard .22 rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers .</s>

<s>you may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm , although the difference in the point of impact ( Jet vs. rim-fire ) can be somewhat disconcerting .</s>

<s>the accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine ;
I tested it in my scoped S & W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun steadily .</s>

<s>hunting rifles , '61
the fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models , actions and calibers .</s>

<s>aside from the Ruger carbine , a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time .</s>

<s>here are the brands ( in alphabetical order ) and the new models .</s>

<s>newcomers to the American hunter are the Browning group of bolt-action , high-power rifles .</s>

<s>they have fine J actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal and the stock wood .</s>

<s>barrel weights vary sensibly with the various calibers available , and these include the standard bores ( about $165 ) plus the Magnums ( around $170 ) ;
the latter include the .264 , .300 S & H , .338 , .375 and .458 .</s>

<s>shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard on all of the Magnums except the .264 .</s>

<s>stock designs are excellent for use with scopes .</s>

<s>Colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are all made with Sako actions , regardless of caliber .</s>

<s>the .222's have the short action ;
the .243 and .308 , the medium action , and the .270 , F and the Magnums , the long action ( about $135 for the Standard Coltsman and $200 for the Custom version ) .</s>

<s>previously , J actions were used for the larger cartridges .</s>

<s>High Standard has introduced a .22 auto , the Sport-King , in two grades -- field and special ( less than $45 and just over $45 , respectively ) .</s>

<s>it's a streamlined rifle , fast and well-made .</s>

<s>among .22 Magnum Rim-Fire rifles , 1961's lone newcomer was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader ( around $60 ) .</s>

<s>previously known as Jefferson Arms , Kodiak has given this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design , and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle .22 Magnum rim-fires .</s>

<s>Marlin has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings .</s>

<s>the Model 99 ( under $45 ) is a light-weight , streamlined .22 rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine that holds 18 Long Rifles .</s>

<s>it's extremely accurate for an auto , and the test rifle I tried was completely trouble-free in functioning .</s>

<s>the 989 ( about $40 ) is an even newer .22 auto , this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip .</s>

<s>once again the Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared , but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination .</s>

<s>the bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert tube which is rifled and which , surprisingly , gives pretty fair accuracy even though it's only 3-1/2 inches long .</s>

<s>you can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with .22 shotshells -- to break the little Targo clay targets .</s>

<s>a trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can throw his own targets .</s>

<s>a spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available .</s>

<s>you can have your choice of a seven-shot repeater , the J ( about $40 ) or a single-shot , the J ( $10 less ) .</s>

<s>the Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wing-shooting practice , but it's tougher than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds .</s>

<s>they'll travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to break one after it passes the 35-foot mark .</s>

<s>the combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds , right now ]
big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line for 1961 , with the addition of the .375 and .458 to the list of Model 725's .</s>

<s>these are made on special order only , in Kodiak grade ( about $310 ) , with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads ;
they weigh around nine pounds .</s>

<s>a shortened version of the highly regarded Remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961 .</s>

<s>this carbine ( under $140 , about $15 more for a deluxe grade ) has an 18-1/2-inch barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's Model 760 pump with a short-barrel .</s>

<s>this design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard .</s>

<s>presently , the J is available in F .</s>

<s>the latest versions of the famous Savage Model 99 are the 99 Featherweight ( about $125 ) and the 99 Deluxe ( under $135 ) , which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger design .</s>

<s>the replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate .</s>

<s>beginners' guns , '61
a fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961 , and they're good bets for your Christmas gift list if you're wondering what to get for a youngster .</s>

<s>the most unusual of them is the Ithaca 49 ( about $20 , $5 for a saddle scabbard ) -- a lever-action single-shot patterned after the famous Winchester lever-action and featuring the Western look .</s>

<s>because of its traditional lines , it probably has more kid appeal than any other model .</s>

<s>the action is a drop-block , handling all the standard .22 rim-fires .</s>

<s>Marlin's latest is also designed for the beginning shooter , although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock .</s>

<s>this is the Model 122 ( about $20 ) ;
it's a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety -- i.e.</s>

<s>, the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun cocked for the next shot .</s>

<s>stock design is excellent , and this model is a good first gun .</s>

<s>another boy's model is the .22 single-shot Remington J ( around $20 ) , which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a short -- 12-1/2-inch -- stock ;
it's just right for a boy of 12-1/2 .</s>

<s>a beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this year .</s>

<s>the single-barrel Stevens J ( under $35 ) is made with a side lever rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren't strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun -- and the side lever does indeed open very easily .</s>

<s>this gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock and is available in either 20 or .410 gauge .</s>

<s>there's another addition to the Stevens line , the pump-action Model 77 in .410 ( under $75 ) , which you may or may not consider a kid's gun ;
many experienced hunters like this gauge and type of scattergun too .</s>

<s>shotguns , '61
although there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year , a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market .</s>

<s>for example , a Browning trap version of the Superposed over/under , the Broadway ( from $350 up , depending on grade ) , differs from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end , a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting .</s>

<s>the Colt line now includes a new scattergun , the Standard or Custom Pump Model ( about $90 and $150 , respectively ) in 12 , 16 and 20 .</s>

<s>Firearms International has introduced another import , this one from Finland .</s>

<s>it's the Valmet ( about $170 ) , a 12-gauge over/under very much like the old Remington 32 -- which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices .</s>

<s>High Standard has also added two models to its line .</s>

<s>the Supermatic Trophy ( prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional features ) is a 12-gauge auto .</s>

<s>the Flite-King Trophy ( beginning at just over $85 ) is a pump gun in 12 or 16 .</s>

<s>either model is a very good dollar value .</s>

<s>Mossberg's latest contribution to the field is the Model 500 ( from $73.50 ) ;
this is an improved version of the old Model 200 , a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun .</s>

<s>see page 24 for a complete report on it .</s>

<s>handguns , '61
aside from the .22 Jet -- which I coupled with the Deerstalker carbine as one of the year's two biggest developments -- few significant innovations appeared among 1961's handguns .</s>

<s>livery stable -- J. Vernon , prop.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>coaching had declined considerably by 1905 , but the sign was still there , near the old Wells Fargo building in San Francisco , creaking in the fog as it had for thirty years .</s>

<s>John Vernon had had all the patronage he cared for -- he had prospered , but he could not retire from horsedom .</s>

<s>coaching was in his blood .</s>

<s>he had two interests in life : the pleasures of the table and driving .</s>

<s>twice a week he drove his tallyho over the Santa Cruz road , upland and through the redwood forest , with orchards below him at one hand , and glimpses of the Pacific at the other .</s>

<s>the journey back he made along the coast road , traveling hell-for-leather , every lantern of the tallyho ablaze .</s>

<s>the southward route was the classic run in California , and the most fashionable .</s>

<s>his patronage on this stretch was made up largely of San Franciscans -- regulars , most of them , and trenchermen like himself .</s>

<s>they did not complain at the inhuman hour of starting ( seven in the morning ) , nor of the tariff , which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco .</s>

<s>breakfast was at the Palace Hotel , luncheon was somewhere in the mountain forest , and dinner was either at Boulder Creek or at Santa Cruz .</s>

<s>gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring , so halts were contrived between meals .</s>

<s>then the Chinese hostler , who rode with Vernon on the box , would break open a hamper and produce filets of smoked bass or sturgeon , sandwiches , pickled eggs , and a rum sangaree to be heated over a spirit lamp .</s>

<s>in spring and in autumn the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend of mine .</s>

<s>they gathered roots , bulbs , odd ferns , leaves , and bits of resin from the rare Santa Lucia fir , which exists only on a forty-five mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains .</s>

<s>in the Spanish days Franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense .</s>

<s>it yields a fragrance as Orphic as that of the pastilles of Malabar .</s>

<s>Vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips , but he could arrange no schedule with the cooks , and he was glad when the trips dropped off , and the botanists began to motor out by themselves .</s>

<s>my friend often breakfasted with Vernon on the morning of the regular tallyho run .</s>

<s>this was an honor , like dining with a captain at his private table .</s>

<s>Vernon's office adjoined the stable , and the walls were adorned with brightly colored lithographs , the folk art of the period .</s>

<s>they advertised harness polish , liniments , Ball's Rubber Boots , Green River Whiskey , Hood's Sarsaparilla , patent medicines , shoe blacking , and chewing tobacco .</s>

<s>the hostler would have the table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove ;
then a porter from Manning's Fish House would trot in with a tray on his head .</s>

<s>it was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster salt roast and a mound of corn fritters .</s>

<s>Vernon was consummately fond of oysters , and Manning's had been famous for them since the Civil War .</s>

<s>oyster salt roast -- oysters on the half shell , cooked on a bed of coarse salt that kept them hot when served -- was a standby at Manning's .</s>

<s>its early morning patrons were coachmen , who fortified themselves for the day with that delicacy .</s>

<s>in the 1890's the Palace Hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager , John C. Kirkpatrick .</s>

<s>this dish much resembles the oysters Rockefeller made famous by Antoine's in New Orleans , though the Palace chef announced it as a variant of Manning's roast oysters .</s>

<s>( gastronomes have long argued about which came first , the Palace's or Antoine's .</s>

<s>Antoine's held as mandatory a splash of absinthe or Pernod on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding .</s>

<s>the Kirkpatrick version holds liqueur as optional .
)</s>

<s>Vernon , however , held out for plain oyster roast , and plenty of it , unadorned by herbs or any seasoning but salt , though he did fancy a bit of lemon .</s>

<s>after the meal , he and his guests went out to inspect the rig ;
this was merely a ritual , to please all hands concerned .</s>

<s>the tallyho had cost Vernon $2,300 .</s>

<s>a replica of two coaches made in England for the Belmont Club in the East , and matchless west of the Rockies , it was the despair of whips on the Santa Cruz run .</s>

<s>one could shave in the reflection of its French-polished panels , and its axles were greased like those of roulette wheels .</s>

<s>the horses were groomed to a high gloss ;
departing , they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw , for they had been trained to drag at important funerals .</s>

<s>but for the start of the Santa Cruz run , the whip fell .</s>

<s>the clients boarded the tallyho at the Palace promptly at seven .</s>

<s>they had been fed a hunting breakfast , so called because a kedgeree , the dish identified with fox hunting , was on the bill .</s>

<s>there are many ways of making a kedgeree , every one of which is right .</s>

<s>here is an original kedgeree recipe from the Family Club's kitchen : Club Kedgeree
flake ( for three ) a cupful of cold boiled haddock , mix with a cupful of cooked rice , two minced hard-boiled eggs , some buttery white sauce done with cream , cayenne , pepper , salt , a pinch of curry , a tablespoonful of minced onion fried , and a bit of anchovy .</s>

<s>heat and serve hot on toast .</s>

<s>the omelet named for Ernest Arbogast , the Palace's chef , was even more in demand .</s>

<s>for decades it was the most popular dish served in the Ladies' Grill at breakfast , and it is one of the few old Palace dishes that still survive .</s>

<s>native California oysters , salty and piquant , as coppery as Delawares and not much larger than a five-cent piece , went into it .</s>

<s>the original formula goes thus : a tablespoonful omelet Arbogast
fry in butter a small minced onion , rub with of flour , add half a cup of cream , six beaten eggs , pepper , celery salt , a teaspoonful of minced chives , a dash of cayenne , and a pinch of nutmeg .</s>

<s>a jigger of dry Sherry follows , and as the mixture stiffens , in go a hundred of the little oysters .</s>

<s>Louis Sherry once stayed a fortnight at the Palace , and he was so pleased with omelet Arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in New York J. Pierpont Morgan had come in his private train to San Francisco , to attend an Episcopal convention , and brought the restaurateur with him .</s>

<s>as things happened , Morgan was installed in the Nob Hill residence of a magnate friend , whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved talent .</s>

<s>Sherry remained in his hotel suite , where he amused himself as best he could .</s>

<s>twice he left everything to his entourage , and fled to make the Santa Cruz tour under Vernon's guidance .</s>

<s>in the grand court of the Palace , notable for its tiers of Moorish galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below , Vernon's station was at the entrance .</s>

<s>it was a post of honor , held inviolate for him ;
he had the primacy among the coachmen .</s>

<s>of majestic build , rubicund and slash-mouthed , he resembled the late General Winfield Scott , who was said to be the most imposing general of his century , if not of all centuries .</s>

<s>Vernon wore a gray tall hat , a gardenia , and maroon Wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly .</s>

<s>promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in the tallyho .</s>

<s>he had style : he held his reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked Epsom surtout , and when the horses leaned at a curve , as if bent by the force of a gale , he leaned with them .</s>

<s>they cantered down the peninsula , not slackening until the coach reached Woodside where the Santa Cruz uplands begin .</s>

<s>the road maps of the region have changed since 1905 ;
inns have burned down , moved elsewhere , or taken other names .</s>

<s>once on the road ( and especially if the passengers were all regulars and masculine ) , the schedule meant nothing .</s>

<s>an agreeable ease suffused Vernon and the passengers of the tallyho , from which there issued clouds of smoke .</s>

<s>Vernon would tilt his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard , indulging in a huge cigar .</s>

<s>the horses moved at a clump ;
they were no more on parade than was their driver ;
one fork of the road was as good as another .</s>

<s>the Santa Cruz mountains sprawl over three counties , and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed columns ripple streams of rain , even when heat bakes the Santa Clara valley below at the left .</s>

<s>the water splashes into shoulder-high tracts of fernery .</s>

<s>you arrive there in seersucker , and feel you were half-witted not to bring a mackintosh .</s>

<s>Vernon kept an account book with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage .</s>

<s>a number of them must have fallen into disfavor ;
they were struck out with remarks in red ink , denouncing both the cooks and the management .</s>

<s>he was copious in his praise of those that served food that was good to eat .</s>

<s>the horses seemed to know these by instinct , he used to say : such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins .</s>

<s>there was Wright's , for one , lost amongst trees , its wide verandas strewn with rockers .</s>

<s>many of its sojourners were devoted to seclusion and quiet , and lived there to the end of their days .</s>

<s>it was the haunt of writer Ambrose Bierce , who admired its redwoods .</s>

<s>acorns from the great oaks fed the small black pigs ( akin to Berkshires ) , whose carcass sweepstakes were renowned .</s>

<s>their ham butts , cured in oak-log smoke , were also esteemed when roasted or boiled , and served with this original sauce : Wright's devil sauce ;

put into a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy , or of the boiled ham liquor , with a half stick of butter , three teaspoonfuls of made mustard , and two mashed garlic cloves .</s>

<s>contribute also an onion , a peeled tomato and two pickled gherkins , and a mashed lime .</s>

<s>after this has simmered an hour , add two tablespoons each of Worcestershire , catsup , and chutney , two pickled walnuts , and a pint of Sherry .</s>

<s>then simmer fifteen minutes longer .</s>

<s>every winter a kegful of this sauce was made and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar , so that when its turn came , it was properly mellowed .</s>

<s>vineyards and orchards also grew around Wright's , and deer were rather a nuisance ;
they leaped six-foot fences with the agility of panthers .</s>

<s>but no one complained when they wound up , regardless of season , in venison pies .</s>

<s>no one complained of the white wine either : at this altitude of two thousand feet , grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint .</s>

<s>( the Almaden vineyards have now climbed to this height .
)</s>

<s>apple trees grew there also .</s>

<s>though creeks in the Santa Cruz mountains flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring , the apples that grow there have a wintry crackle .</s>

<s>dwellers thereabouts preferred to get their apple pies at the local bakery , which had a brick oven fired with redwood billets .</s>

<s>the merit of the pie , Vernon believed , was due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven .</s>

<s>the recipe , which he got from the baker , and wrote down in his ledger , is basically this : Wright's apple pie ;

peel , core , and slice across enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin , and set aside .</s>

<s>in a saucepan put sufficient water to cover them , an equal amount of sugar , a sliced lemon , a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam , a pinch each of clove and nutmeg , and a large bay leaf .</s>

<s>let this boil gently for twenty minutes , then strain .</s>

<s>poach the apples in this syrup for twelve minutes , drain them , and cool .</s>

<s>set the apples in the pastry-lined tin , spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter , with as much brown sugar , a sprinkling of nutmeg , and a fresh bay leaf , then lay on a cover of pastry , and gild it with beaten yolk of egg .</s>

<s>those who have never traveled the width and length of this land cannot conceive , on the basis of textbook description alone , the overwhelming space and variety of this country held together under one government .</s>

<s>the miracle of democratic America comes home to one most strongly only when one has seen the endless Great Plains of the Midwest ;
the sky-reaching peaks of the Northwest mountains ;

<s>built upon seven hills , Istanbul , like Rome , is one of the most ancient cities in the world , filled with splendor and contrast .</s>

<s>it is an exotic place , so different from the ordinary that the casual tourist is likely to see at first only the contrast and the ugliness of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses .</s>

<s>at the moment , many of these are being pulled down .</s>

<s>whole blocks are disappearing and more are scheduled to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will show off its treasures to better advantage -- the great domes and graceful spires of its mosques , the panorama of the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn .</s>

<s>even when they are finished , however , the contrast will remain , for Istanbul is the only city in the world that is built upon two continents .</s>

<s>for almost 3,000 years Europe and Asia have rubbed shoulders in its streets .</s>

<s>founded in the Ninth Century B.C.</s>

<s>it was called Byzantium 200 years later when Byzas , ruler of the Megarians , expanded the settlement and named it after himself .</s>

<s>about a thousand years after that , when the Roman Empire was divided , it became capital of the Eastern section .</s>

<s>on May 11,330 A.D. , its name was changed again , this time to Constantinople after its emperor , Constantine .</s>

<s>in 1453 when the last vestige of ancient Roman power fell to the Turks , the city officially shifted religions -- although the Patriarch , or Pope , of the Orthodox Church continued to live there , and still does -- and became the capital of the Ottoman Empire .</s>

<s>when that was broken up after the First World War , its name was changed once more .</s>

<s>rich in Christian and Moslem art , Istanbul is today a fascinating museum of East and West that recently became a seaside resort as well with the development of new beaches on the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara only a short distance from the center of town .</s>

<s>easy to get to , and becoming more popular every year , it is only fourteen hours from New York by Pan American World Airways jet , four hours from Rome .</s>

<s>start of tour
most of the sights lie in the old section across the Golden Horn from the modern hotels .</s>

<s>I started my tour of them at the Turkish Government Tourist Office , next to Pan American's office on the left as you enter the driveway that leads to the Hilton Hotel .</s>

<s>from there I turned left along Cumhuriyet Cadesi past more hotels and a park on the left , Republic Gardens , and came in a few moments to Taksim Square , one of the hubs of the city , with the Monument of the Republic , erected in 1928 , in its center .</s>

<s>directly across from the Gardens I found a bus stop sign for J 4 and rode it down to the Bosphorus , with the sports center on my left just before I reached the water and the entrance to Dolmabahce Palace immediately after that .</s>

<s>there the bus turned right along the Bosphorus , past ocean liners at anchor , to Galata Bridge over the entrance to the Golden Horn , a brown sweep of water that empties into the Bosphorus .</s>

<s>across the bridge on the left I saw St. Sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires of the Blue Mosque .</s>

<s>on the other side of the Golden Horn I rode through Eminonu Square , with Yeni Cami , or the New Mosque , which dates from the Seventeenth Century , just across from the entrance to the bridge .</s>

<s>passing it , the bus climbed a hill , with the covered spice bazaar on the right and Pandelli's , a famous and excellent restaurant , above it .</s>

<s>at the top of the hill the buildings on the left gave way to a park .</s>

<s>I got off there , crossed the street , walked ahead with St. Sophia on my left , the Blue Mosque on my right , and in a moment came to the entrance of St. Sophia .</s>

<s>erected on the site of pagan temples and three previous St. Sophias , the first of which was begun by Constantine , this fourth church was started by Justinian in 532 and completed twenty years later .</s>

<s>on his first trip to the finished structure he boasted that he had built a temple grander than Solomon's in Jerusalem .</s>

<s>a few years later the dome fell in .</s>

<s>nevertheless , it remained one of the most splendid churches of the Eastern Empire , where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned .</s>

<s>after the Turks conquered the city in 1453 they converted it to a mosque , adding the stubby minarets .</s>

<s>in the second half of the Sixteenth Century , Sinan , the great architect who is the Michelangelo of the East , designed the massive buttresses that now help support the dome .</s>

<s>with the birth of the Turkish Republic after the First World War , St. Sophia became a museum , and the ancient mosaics , which were plastered over by the Moslems , whose religion forbids pictures in holy places , have been restored .</s>

<s>inside over the first door I saw one of these , which shows Constantine offering the city to the Virgin Mary and Justinian offering the temple .</s>

<s>on the columns around the immense dome are round plaques with Arabic writing .</s>

<s>the eight green columns , I learned , came from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus , the others , red , from the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis .</s>

<s>beneath the dome I saw the spot where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned , a bit of floor protected now by a wooden fence .</s>

<s>behind this is a minber or Moslem pulpit and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork , where the emperors and , after them , the sultans , sat .</s>

<s>directly opposite is the emperor's door , through which they entered the building .</s>

<s>outside St. Sophia I walked through the flower garden in front of it , with the Blue Mosque ahead on my left .</s>

<s>across the street on my right I saw the Hippodrome , now a park .</s>

<s>it was laid out in 196 for chariot races and other public games .</s>

<s>statues and other monuments that stood there were stolen , mostly by the waves of Crusaders .</s>

<s>at the beginning of the Hippodrome I saw the Kaiser's Fountain , an ugly octagonal building with a glass dome , built in 1895 by the German Emperor , and on my left , directly across from it , the tomb of Sultan Ahmet , who constructed the Blue Mosque , more properly known by his name .</s>

<s>just before coming to the mosque entrance I crossed the street , entered the Hippodrome , and walked ahead to the Obelisk of Theodosius , originally erected in Heliopolis in Egypt about 1,600 B.C.</s>

<s>by Thutmose , who also built those now in New York , London and Rome at the Lateran .</s>

<s>this one was set up here in 390 A.D. on a pedestal , the faces of which are carved with statues of the emperor and his family watching games in the Hippodrome , done so realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them .</s>

<s>beyond it I noted a small green column , about twelve feet below the present ground level -- the Serpentine Column , three entwined serpents , which once stood at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi , Greece .</s>

<s>near the end of the Hippodrome I came upon the Built Column , a truncated obelisk of blocks , all that remains of a monument that once rivalled the Colossus of Rhodes .</s>

<s>magnificent Mosque
retracing my steps to the Mosque of Sultan Ahmet , only one with six minarets , I entered the courtyard , with a gallery supported by pointed arches running around it and a fountain in the middle .</s>

<s>one of the most beautiful buildings in Istanbul , it was constructed in the early years of the Seventeenth Century , with a huge central dome , two half domes that seem to cascade down from it , and smaller full domes around the gallery .</s>

<s>the round minarets , tall and graceful , rise from rectangular bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer .</s>

<s>inside , the walls are covered with blue and white tile , the floor with red and cream carpets .</s>

<s>back at the Kaiser's Fountain , I walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill -- any car will do -- past the Column of Constantine , also known as the Burnt Column , at the top on my right .</s>

<s>it stands in the middle of what was once the Forum of Constantine , who brought it from Rome .</s>

<s>I stayed on the car for a few minutes until , turning right , it entered a huge square , Bayezit , with the Bayezit Mosque on the right and the gate to the university just beyond it .</s>

<s>there I got off , crossed the square , and on the side directly opposite the gate found a good restaurant , hard to come by in this part of the city .</s>

<s>called the Marmara Gazinosu , it is on the third floor , with signs pointing the way there , and has a terrace overlooking the Sea of Marmara .</s>

<s>after lunch , in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street I found a pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava -- a sweet , flaky cake -- in Istanbul .</s>

<s>it's a great favorite of the university students , and I joined them there for dessert .</s>

<s>taking the streetcar back to Kaiser's Fountain , I walked ahead , then left down the street opposite St. Sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small , one-story building with a red-tile roof , which is the entrance to the Sunken Palace .</s>

<s>actually an underground cistern , its roof supported by rows and rows of pillars , it was built by Justinian in the Sixth Century to supply the palace with water .</s>

<s>there is still water in it .</s>

<s>I found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately .</s>

<s>outside I walked past the entrance to St. Sophia , turned left at the end of it , and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead .</s>

<s>just before reaching it I came to a grey and brown stone building that looks somewhat like an Oriental pagoda , with Arabic lettering in gold and colored tile decorations -- the Fountain of Sultan Ahmet .</s>

<s>going through the Imperial Gate in the wall , I entered the grounds of Topkapi Palace , home of the Sultans and nerve center of the vast Ottoman Empire , and walked along a road toward another gate in the distance , past the Church of St. Irene , completed by Constantine in 330 A.D. on my left , and then , just outside the second gate , I saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right -- the Executioner's Spring , where he washed his hands and his sword after beheading his victims .</s>

<s>passing through the gate , with towers on either side once used as prisons , I entered a huge square surrounded by buildings , and on the wall to my right found a general plan of the grounds , with explanations in English for each building .</s>

<s>there are a good many of them .</s>

<s>at one time about 10,000 people lived there .</s>

<s>following arrowed signs , I veered right toward the former kitchens , complete with chimneys , which now house one of the world's greatest collections of Chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner services .</s>

<s>next to it is a copper section , with cooking utensils and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate , floor-length robe .</s>

<s>in the court once more , I went right toward the Reception House , a long one-story building with a deep portico .</s>

<s>going through a door into another small court , I had the Throne Room directly in front .</s>

<s>I walked to the right around it to buildings containing illuminated manuscripts and came to the Treasury , which houses such things as coffee cups covered with diamonds , jewelled swords , rifles glittering with diamonds and huge divan-like thrones as large as small beds , on which the sultans sat cross-legged .</s>

<s>they are made of gold and covered with emeralds , pearls and other jewels .</s>

<s>taking the path behind the Throne Room to the building directly beyond it , the Portrait Gallery , I went right at the end of it , through a garden to a small building at the back -- a sitting room furnished with low blue divans , its floor covered with carpets , its ceiling painted with gold squares and floral designs .</s>

<s>( do start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals .</s>

<s>do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them .</s>

<s>if doubtful about a steak , boldly cut it in half .</s>

<s>or buy half a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for different kinds of barbecues .</s>

<s>oilcloth only costs about 79-cents a yard for the very best .</s>

<s>tougher than plastic , it wears well .</s>

<s>don't forget -- when you take to the hills or the beach -- that your cooler , which you might have used for wine- or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard , is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments .</s>

<s>there are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes .</s>

<s>do use paper napkins ;

<s>don't think barbecue cooking is just sometimes , or seasonal .</s>

<s>it's year-round , and everywhere .</s>

<s>in the winter , hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace .</s>

<s>even use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter , inside .</s>

<s>threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes , a bit of green pepper , a fresh white mushroom -- any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook , and a meal a feast .</s>

<s>sure , for the most of us , a frankfurter is the favorite .</s>

<s>a story goes that a certain Herr Feuchtwanger of St. Louis , around 1883 served his sausages ( grilled ) and mustard to his fancy customers .</s>

<s>so that his customers should not soil their hands , Feuchtwanger issued white gloves .</s>

<s>discovery that the gloves frequently left with the customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come upon a compromise .</s>

<s>he had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks .</s>

<s>years later , franks-in-buns were accepted as the first to go at the New York Polo Grounds .</s>

<s>the nation's number one picnic treat is the skinless frankfurter -- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or , more sedately , charcoal broiled on a portable grill .</s>

<s>either way it's hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation .</s>

<s>to make the picnic frank come close to perfection , remember these tips : -- score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through .</s>

<s>this permits the juices to permeate the meat during cooking .</s>

<s>-- relishes are as vital to the success of the frank as are buns .</s>

<s>bring along the conventional ones -- catsup , pickle relish , mustard , mayonnaise -- plus a few extras , such as tangy barbecue sauce , chive cream cheese , or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd .</s>

<s>-- using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns , too .</s>

<s>watch closely while browning them , as it doesn't take long .</s>

<s>-- an unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks in French dressing or a mixture of honey , lemon juice and brown sugar prior to the picnic .</s>

<s>broil or toast as usual .</s>

<s>roll clay to thickness indicated in individual instructions .</s>

<s>whenever possible , use the wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay .</s>

<s>when mold has more than one design cavity , make individual paper patterns .</s>

<s>place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position ( cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for defects ;

<s>be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles .</s>

<s>allow project to stand for about five minutes ( if wooden press mold is a good antique , do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold to crack ) .</s>

<s>to release clay from mold , place hands in a cupped position around project ;
gently lift the edge on far side , then continue to release edge completely around mold .</s>

<s>slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay , but too much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold .</s>

<s>place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat , clay and mold in one action .</s>

<s>Hotei is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and every inch a family boat .</s>

<s>menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view .</s>

<s>youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom , bunks for three , galley and marine toilet .</s>

<s>the gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit .</s>

<s>all are well distributed , not crowded together near the stern .</s>

<s>and with passenger weight shifted forward , Hotei levels off for speed under power of a Merc 800 .</s>

<s>the 80-hp motor drives her at 25 J with six aboard ]
with only two aboard , Hotei does better than 27 J -- and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed even in a three-foot chop .</s>

<s>she also banks into a turn like a fine runabout -- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser .</s>

<s>nor is she a wet boat .</s>

<s>we've been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry .</s>

<s>a lot of thought went into storage space construction .</s>

<s>there's a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items .</s>

<s>the cabin has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for water skiis , life jackets , etc.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>the aft cockpit has a F storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat .</s>

<s>on each side of the motor well there's storage for battery , bumpers , line and spare props with six-gallon gas tanks below .</s>

<s>the well itself is designed to take two Merc 800's or 500's if you wish and there's room for a 25-gallon long-cruise gas tank below it .</s>

<s>needless to say , you can't build Hotei in a couple of weeks .</s>

<s>our building time was slightly over 400 hours -- but the total cost for the hull with Fiberglas bottom , sink , head and hardware was under $800 .</s>

<s>a comparable manufactured boat would cost close to $3,000 .</s>

<s>consider what you have to earn to be able to spend the $3,000 and your building time is well worth it .</s>

<s>a Gator trailer , Model 565 , is used to transport the boat to the waterways .</s>

<s>this piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years .</s>

<s>all framing in Hotei is one-inch mahogany which , in the dressed state you buy it , is about the 13/16-inch thickness specified in the drawings .</s>

<s>therefore , the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens , etc.</s>

<s>, on a table saw .</s>

<s>besides flathead bronze screws , silicon bronze Stronghold nails ( made by Independent Nail & Packing Co. , Bridgewater , Mass. )</s>

<s>are used extensively in assembly and Weldwood resorcinol glue is used in all the joints .</s>

<s>construction follows a thorough study of the drawings .</s>

<s>start by laying out the six frames and the transom on a level floor .</s>

<s>draw each outline in a different-color chalk , one on top of the other .</s>

<s>in this way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes .</s>

<s>the transom frame is made first with the joints lapped , glued and fastened with one-inch , No.</s>

<s>12 Stronghold nails .</s>

<s>after notching it for the keelson , chines and battens , the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue and the same type nails .</s>

<s>all frames are butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets are glued and nailed on each side of each joint , again using the one-inch , No.</s>

<s>12 nails .</s>

<s>the frames are notched only for the keelson and the chines .</s>

<s>if notched for the battens , they would require more work , be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge water could flow through .</s>

<s>nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking .</s>

<s>the jig is erected after the frames and transom are complete .</s>

<s>this is an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull as you advance in construction .</s>

<s>be sure all members are parallel , vertical and level as required .</s>

<s>after the frames and transom are set up on the jig and temporarily braced , a piece of three-inch-wide mahogany ( only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch thickness is used throughout ) is butted between frames one and two below the line of the keelson .</s>

<s>the frames are glued and screwed to this piece .</s>

<s>the joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated Fiberglas cloth and nailed .</s>

<s>it is over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are spliced .</s>

<s>the keelson , made of two three-inch widths , is next installed .</s>

<s>the first piece is glued and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames one and two .</s>

<s>the second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the first .</s>

<s>note , however , that it is six inches shorter at the forward end .</s>

<s>one-inch , No.</s>

<s>10 screws are used in both cases .</s>

<s>a stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one .</s>

<s>the stem is laminated from four pieces .</s>

<s>take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four .</s>

<s>then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig .</s>

<s>the first two pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames .</s>

<s>the second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member .</s>

<s>they're glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson .</s>

<s>a number of J clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets .</s>

<s>all bottom battens are two inches wide .</s>

<s>the side ones are a half-inch narrower .</s>

<s>the battens are carefully fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all frames .</s>

<s>glue and 1-1/2-inch , No.</s>

<s>10 screws are used .</s>

<s>placement is important because the rear seat , bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens .</s>

<s>with the exception of two battens , all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful beveling .</s>

<s>the chines go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bending .</s>

<s>fairing is always a tedious job but the work can be cut down considerably with a Skill planer and a simple jig .</s>

<s>I clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer with a pair of Sure Grips .</s>

<s>the aluminum , flush against the battens , acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily .</s>

<s>if you don't own a planer and don't want to buy one , it's well worth renting .</s>

<s>the planking is five-ply , 3/8-inch-thick Weldwood Royal Marine plywood .</s>

<s>this can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long .</s>

<s>the 42-inch width leaves very little waste .</s>

<s>four pieces are used .</s>

<s>plank the sides first , using glue and one-inch , No.</s>

<s>12 Stronghold nails at all battens , the stem and the transom .</s>

<s>another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening .</s>

<s>the best procedure is to have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off .</s>

<s>then trim the excess .</s>

<s>I used a Homemaster Routo-Jig made by Porter Cable for this job .</s>

<s>it's good for cutting all the planking because it cuts with a bit-like blade at high J and does not chatter the plywood like a saber saw .</s>

<s>when cut , the planking is clamped in place for a final and careful trimming .</s>

<s>then it is marked on the inside where it comes in contact with the transom , frames , keelson and all the battens .</s>

<s>it may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings .</s>

<s>the next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at the contact points .</s>

<s>then it is replaced and fastened .</s>

<s>the bottom planking is applied in the same manner .</s>

<s>after planking , the bottom gets a layer of Fiberglas .</s>

<s>the spray rails are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with screws .</s>

<s>then the chines are rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation .</s>

<s>since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails , they are also rough-sanded in that area .</s>

<s>the cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time .</s>

<s>a 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line by about three inches .</s>

<s>lay the cloth in place and trim it to size .</s>

<s>then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin .</s>

<s>when the resin has hardened , mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish .</s>

<s>I used bright red , mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding the hardener .</s>

<s>using a cheap brush , coat one side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the cloth .</s>

<s>when the cloth is smooth , apply another coat of resin , spreading it with a paint roller .</s>

<s>be sure it is well saturated and then allow it to harden .</s>

<s>when the whole bottom has hardened , use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail .</s>

<s>then lay a three-inch-wide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of the stem .</s>

<s>before the resin has hardened , screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline .</s>

<s>this protects the bottom in beaching .</s>

<s>Fiberglas materials are available from Glass Plastic Supply Co. , 1605 W. Elizabeth Ave. , Linden , N. J. .</s>

<s>they will also supply literature on application .</s>

<s>the hull is now turned over ( with the help of about seven friends ) and placed in a level , well-braced position .</s>

<s>I set it on the Gator trailer .</s>

<s>I laid three layers of glass cloth on the inside of the stem , also installing a bow eye at this time .</s>

<s>for added strength , I also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint .</s>

<s>again , these blocks were set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed .</s>

<s>after trimming off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at a working height , the top of the side planking is installed .</s>

<s>this is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom .</s>

<s>these flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry .</s>

<s>when they're on , the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten .</s>

<s>the sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom , forming a real strong transom brace .</s>

<s>note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces .</s>

<s>the decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine plywood .</s>

<s>all the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior fir plywood .</s>

<s>most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring .</s>

<s>the exception is where the flooring butts .</s>

<s>these battens are glued and screwed to the frames .</s>

<s>with all deck battens in place , the bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line .</s>

<s>use one coat of Firzite and one coat of marine paint .</s>

<s>bottoms of the floorboards are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place .</s>

<s>after the decking is on , the cabin sides are installed .</s>

<s>they're followed by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated .</s>

<s>the windshield glass is shatterproof and Plexiglas is used in the cabin .</s>

<s>inside , bunks are framed up and installed as indicated .</s>

<s>a head is a handy thing to have and I installed one under a removable section of the port bunk .</s>

<s>the sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above the sink .</s>

<s>for padding the seats and bunks , I used Ensolite , Type J .</s>

<s>lightweight , non-absorbent , fire resistant and dimensionally stable , it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement .</s>

<s>available in F sheets , it costs about a dollar a square foot .</s>

<s>you can build this vacation cottage yourself .</s>

<s>it is a full scale , small , but efficient house that can become a year 'round retreat complete in every detail .</s>

<s>because of the unique design by the architect Egils Hermanovski , you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time .</s>

<s>most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials , and requires the use of only simple tools .</s>

<s>on the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation cottage , from choosing the proper site to applying the final trim .</s>

<s>in recognition of the growing trend for second homes , or vacation cottages , we have designed this one specifically with the family handyman in mind .</s>

<s>it is a big project , not to be taken lightly .</s>

<s>but each step has been broken down into easy stages , utilizing standard materials and simple tools , well within the capabilities of the handyman .</s>

<s>the theory
the idea behind our design is modular units , or panelization .</s>

<s>everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes and measurements of materials .</s>

<s>wall panels and structural timbers are standard as are windows and doors , making for a minimum of cutting .</s>

<s>we have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop , panel by panel , according to plan .</s>

<s>thus , when you have prepared your foundation and laid the floor , these can be trucked to the site and erected with a small crew of friends in a weekend .</s>

<s>the roof timbers are precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed in a matter of three or four days .</s>

<s>then you can do the finishing touches at your leisure .</s>

<s>a warning
due to the fact that building codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country , the first thing to do is to find out what , if any , they are .</s>

<s>close to a large city they might even specify the size of the nails used ;
in a remote section there might be no restrictions at all .</s>

<s>this can usually be found out at the nearest town hall .</s>

<s>at the same time check the electrical , plumbing , and sanitary requirements , as well as possible zoning regulations .</s>

<s>whether electricity and public water and sewers are available or not , check the local customs in the use of bottled or J gas ( we give you alternatives later on ) .</s>

<s>be sure that this information is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion .</s>

<s>if there are any major restrictions , they usually can be obtained in printed form .</s>

<s>where a building permit is required , find out what you must present when applying for one .</s>

<s>in many cases , you must file a complete set of plans with the local building inspector .</s>

<s>these will be available at cost from our Plans Department .</s>

<s>the site
some general things to look for in a site , if you haven't already bought one , are accessibility , water drainage , and orientation .</s>

<s>how are the roads , and how will they stand up ?</s>

<s>is there evidence of wash-outs on the property ;
swampy areas or intermittent springs ?</s>

<s>a visit in the early spring after a thaw will be very informative .</s>

<s>note where the sun rises and sets , and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms come from .</s>

<s>will the view be something you can live with ?</s>

<s>don't worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain ;
we will take up alternative foundations later on .</s>

<s>the materials
with this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic ( JA version ) and the expandable ( JB version ) .</s>

<s>this will be for the shell of the house only ( roof , walls , and floor ) , and does not include the carport or balcony .</s>

<s>this will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost .</s>

<s>bear in mind that this does not include interior panels for partitions , fancy flooring , appliances and fixtures , electrical wiring , and plumbing , all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues .</s>

<s>the wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard F and F of a good grade , free from structural faults .</s>

<s>they should be as straight as possible , as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are erected .</s>

<s>the outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood , plastic coated panel board , high density particle board , asbestos-cement board , or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer .</s>

<s>the inner panels do not have to be weatherproof , and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired .</s>

<s>all panel board comes in standard F foot size .</s>

<s>it is recommended that panels be both glued as well as nailed to the frame .</s>

<s>the fixed window panels with louvers should have a good grade of 1/8-inch double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing compound .</s>

<s>the louvers are constructed as shown in the detail , with a drop door for ventilation .</s>

<s>there are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them .</s>

<s>the door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade .</s>

<s>the filler panels for the gable ends are cut from full F sheets as shown , leaving no wastage .</s>

<s>the battens covering the joints are of F stock and are applied after the walls are erected .</s>

<s>all nails should be rustproof , and aluminum is highly recommended .</s>

<s>note : if 1/2-inch panel board is used inside and out , or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other , and 1/8-inch glass is used , stock lumber in F , F , and F can be used in making the glass panels .</s>

<s>other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special size lumber for the glass trim .</s>

<s>in any case , there is no special milling or rabbeting required for the panels .</s>

<s>with modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting tools , fixtures , and attachments available , the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool .</s>

<s>the drill press consists of a vertical shaft ( spindle ) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill chuck , a tubular housing ( quill ) in which the spindle is mounted , a head in which the quill is mounted , a feed lever which moves the quill up or down , a power source , and a movable table upon which the work is placed .</s>

<s>there is often a means of locking the quill and , on larger presses , the table can be tilted .</s>

<s>the size of the press is usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity ( the maximum diameter tool shank it will hold ) or distance between the spindle center and the column .</s>

<s>a press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle .</s>

<s>a new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done at any angle .</s>

<s>the head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work .</s>

<s>set-up and maintenance
the drill press should be leveled and , depending on whether it is a bench or floor model , bolted securely to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws .</s>

<s>this will reduce vibration and increase accuracy .</s>

<s>a coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the polished surface of the table ;
wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage rusting of the column and quill .</s>

<s>presses not fitted with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in the lubrication holes in the quill .</s>

<s>the rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush .</s>

<s>be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and grease .</s>

<s>belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount .</s>

<s>keep the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when pulled by hand ;
excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle bearings .</s>

<s>most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds the quill in the raised position .</s>

<s>the return spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing with a pair of pliers ( to prevent the spring from unwinding when it is released ) , loosening the lock nut or screw , and rotating the housing until the desired tension is achieved .</s>

<s>turning the housing clockwise will reduce tension , counter-clockwise will increase it .</s>

<s>don't lose the chuck key .</s>

<s>some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key ;
otherwise , you'll have to spend a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not in use .</s>

<s>feeds and speeds
drill speeds are important if you want a good job .</s>

<s>each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed , depending on the material worked .</s>

<s>on most drill presses , it is impossible to get the exact speed , but you can come close by adjusting the drive belt on the step-cone pulleys .</s>

<s>you will find a chart giving the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere in the instruction booklet that came with the tool .</s>

<s>see the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds .</s>

<s>generally , the larger the tool and the harder the material , the slower the speed .</s>

<s>feed pressure is also of major importance .</s>

<s>too much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools .</s>

<s>too light a feed , particularly with metal or other hard material , causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting edge .</s>

<s>the best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate .</s>

<s>common drilling tools
there are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes .</s>

<s>the most common are the twist drill , the solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades , the double spur bit , and the power wood bit .</s>

<s>all will do a good job if sharp , but the twist drills don't cut quite as smoothly as the others , since they do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual boring starts .</s>

<s>the adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by reversing the cutter blade .</s>

<s>since fly cutters are one sided and not balanced , they should be used at the slowest speed available , and fed very slowly to avoid binding .</s>

<s>fly cutters can fool you into putting your hand too close to the tool , so if you want to avoid nicked fingers , keep your hands well out of the way .</s>

<s>simple hole drilling operations
when drilling all the way through a workpiece , always place a piece of scrap wood underneath .</s>

<s>this will not only protect the work table , but also assure a clean breakthrough .</s>

<s>another method of assuring a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through , then drill half way with the dimensional bit , turn the piece over , and finish from the other side .</s>

<s>in soft woods with pronounced grain , there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander , due to the varying hardness of the wood .</s>

<s>in this case , drilling a small pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy .</s>

<s>when a hole is to be bored to a predetermined depth , mark the depth on the side of the stock , then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark .</s>

<s>the depth gauge rod can now be set , and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth .</s>

<s>the old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in Massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects .</s>

<s>for their length , their types of construction , their picturesque settings , and their literary associations , they should be known and remembered .</s>

<s>in this sequence I shall write about them in the order of their erection .</s>

<s>the first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part , -- and perhaps the most interesting one , connected Newbury ( now Newburyport ) with Salisbury Point .</s>

<s>its building was first proposed in 1791 , when a group of citizens , mostly Newburyport men , petitioned the General Court for an act of incorporation .</s>

<s>this document began : No.</s>

<s>1 Newbury Port , may 30th , 1791
whereas , a Bridge over Merrimack River , from the Land of Hon'ble Jonathan Greenleaf , Esquire , in Newbery , to Deer Island , and from said Island to Salisbury , would be of very extensive utility , by affording a safe Conveyance to Carriages , Teams and Travellers at all seasons of the year , and at all Times of Tide .</s>

<s>we , the Subscribers , do agree , that as soon as a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to this , or a similar Writing , We will present a petition to the Hon'ble General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , praying for an Act incorporating into a Body politic the subscribers to such Writing with Liberty to build such a Bridge , and a Right to demand a Toll equal to that received at Malden Bridge , and on like Terms , and if such an Act shall be obtained , then we severally agree each with the others , that we will hold in the said Bridge the several shares set against our respective Names , the whole into two hundred shares being divided , and that we will pay such sums of Money at such Times and in such Manners , as by the said proposed Corporation , shall be directed and required .</s>

<s>this paper was signed by forty-five persons , subscribing a total of two hundred shares .</s>

<s>a month later the General Court served notice to the town of Newbury that the bridge was to be built .</s>

<s>the matter was considered and reconsidered , and finally opposed , but in spite of many objections , the Court granted a charter on January 9 , 1792 .</s>

<s>on November 26 of that year the bridge was completed and opened .</s>

<s>Timothy Palmer , who invented and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges , was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the Essex , or Deer Island bridge although the actual work was carried out under the direction of William Coombs , who received $300 as recompense .</s>

<s>this two-part bridge is best described by Rev.</s>

<s>Timothy Dwight , president of Yale College , in his Travels In New-England And New-York , published in New Haven in 1821 .</s>

<s>he says of it : it consists of two divisions , separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore .</s>

<s>the division between the island and this shore , consists principally of an arch ;
whose chord is one hundred and sixty feet , and whose vortex is forty feet ( it was actually 37 feet ) above the high-water mark .</s>

<s>in appearance and construction it resembles the Pascataqua bridge .</s>

<s>the whole length of Essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four .</s>

<s>I have already mentioned that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country .</s>

<s>as Mr. Palmer was educated to house-building only , and had never seen a structure of this nature ;
he certainly deserves not a little credit for the invention .</s>

<s>it is hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that Timothy Palmer was born in 1751 in nearby Rowley ;
that he moved with his parents to West Boxford when he was sixteen years old ;
and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect , Moody Spofford .</s>

<s>it was indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch , which appears in his famous bridges at Portsmouth , Haverhill , and Philadelphia .</s>

<s>the Essex Merrimack Bridge when first built was not covered .</s>

<s>as far as we know , no American bridge had been thus protected in 1792 .</s>

<s>Richard S. Allen is the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed by 1810 .</s>

<s>its original appearance is shown in an engraving published in the Massachusetts Magazine in May 1793 , which is reproduced herewith ( Fig.</s>

<s>1 ) .</s>

<s>a brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber .</s>

<s>between the abutments on the Newbury shore and the south bank of Deer Island there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet ;
between the north shore of Deer Island and the Salisbury side there was an arch of 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long .</s>

<s>a dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place July 4 , 1793 , in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island .</s>

<s>it is said that the eccentric Timothy Dexter , who was one of the first share-holders , stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion .</s>

<s>the Essex Journal says that he delivered an oration on the bridge , which for elegance of style , propriety of speech or force of argument , was truly Ciceronian .</s>

<s>the reporter must have written this with tongue in cheek , because Dexter's oration could hardly be understood ;
and , although he later explained that he was talking French , it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys of the evening .</s>

<s>the north portion of the Essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction , although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning .</s>

<s>it stood in its original form until 1882 .</s>

<s>the southern half , however , on account of its underbracing , was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation .</s>

<s>in 1810 it was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge .</s>

<s>this was built by John Templeman from plans submitted by James Finley of Fayette County , Pennsylvania .</s>

<s>Timothy Palmer had general supervision of the work .</s>

<s>an advertisement in the Newburyport Herald , December 21 , 1810 , shows Palmer in a new light as an expert on chain bridges
.</s>

<s>it reads : chain bridges .</s>

<s>information is hereby given that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport , Mass.</s>

<s>has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the Patentees of the Chain Bridge , in the states of Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Vermont , Rhode Island , and Connecticut , so far as relates to the sale of Patent rights and the construction of Chain Bridges .</s>

<s>Mr. Palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site , and lay out and superintend the work , or recommend a suitable person to execute it .</s>

<s>John Templeman approved Timothy Palmer .</s>

<s>this chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden arch on the Salisbury end .</s>

<s>it fell , February 6 , 1827 , carrying with it a horse and wagon , two men and four oxen .</s>

<s>the horse and men were saved , but the oxen drowned .</s>

<s>in spite of this catastrophe , the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened again on July 17 , 1827 .</s>

<s>this second chain bridge was 570 feet long , had two thirty-foot towers and a draw , and a double roadway .</s>

<s>the Essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868 , when the County Commissioners laid out all the Merrimack bridges as highways .</s>

<s>sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous use , the old covered , wooden bridge that spans the Tygartis Valley River at Philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance of the first land battle of the Civil War at its home site , May 28th to June 3rd .</s>

<s>Colonel Frederick W. Lander , impersonated , will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of Talbott's ( now College ) Hill and thunder across the bridge to join Colonel Benjamin F. Kelley's ( West ) Virginia Infantry , then swarming through the streets in pursuit of the retreating Confederates .</s>

<s>he was closely followed by the Ohio and Indiana troops -- thus the old bridge has another distinction ;
that of being the first such structure secured by force of arms in the war of the '60s .</s>

<s>the bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements , war , fire , and floods , as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic , for more than a hundred years .</s>

<s>twice during the Civil War it was saved from destruction by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister .</s>

<s>it still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on U.S. Route 250 -- the old Beverly and Fairmont Turnpike .</s>

<s>it is one of the very few , if not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the U.S. highway system , thus it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days .</s>

<s>this covered , wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action in the early morning of June 3 , 1861 , and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the Philippi area that it has become a part and parcel of the war story .</s>

<s>so frequently have pictures of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the old John Brown Fort at Harpers Ferry as the two nationally best known structures in West Virginia .</s>

<s>completed and opened for traffic in 1852 , the bridge was designed and built by Lemuel Chenoweth and his brother , Eli , of Beverly .</s>

<s>the Chenoweth brothers were experienced bridge builders , and against the competition of other , and better known , bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of the covered , wooden bridges on the Parkersburg and Staunton Turnpike a dozen years before , as well as many other bridges for several counties .</s>

<s>the Philippi bridge , however , was the Chenoweth master piece , with its 139-foot , dual lane , span -- and it stands today as a monument to its builders .</s>

<s>never rebuilt , the bridge was strengtened in 1938 by two extra piers , a concrete floor , and a walk-way along the upper side in order to care for modern traffic .</s>

<s>during the war it was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the railhead at Grafton to the troops operating in the interior .</s>

<s>Union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other inclement weather , and some of them left momentoes of their stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams .</s>

<s>but what the elements could not do was seriously threatened when Brigadier General William E. ( Grumble ) Jones reached Philippi while on the famous Jones-Imboden raid in May , 1863 .</s>

<s>General Jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings , including the long bridge at Fairmont , and , after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge , he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and around it .</s>

<s>Reverend Joshual Corder , a Baptist minister , gathered a few citizens of Southern sympathies , to call on Jones and plead with him to spare the structure ;
he reasoned and argued , pointing out that Jones or other Confederate commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat .</s>

<s>Jones relented , he did not order his men to apply the torch -- the drove of livestock was driven up the valley , via Beverly , and across the mountains to feed and serve the Confederate army , while Jones and his raiders turned toward Buckhannon to join forces with Imboden .</s>

<s>again Reverend Corder saved the bridge when Union soldiers planned to destroy it , after filling its two lanes with hay and straw -- but for what reason is not recorded nor remembered , certainly not because of pressure from an opposing Confederate force .</s>

<s>on the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose .</s>

<s>centering around this historic old structure , a group of public-spirited Barbour County citizens have organized and planned a week-long series of events , beginning on May 28th and continuing through June 3rd , to observe most appropriately the centennial of the first land engagement of the Civil War at Philippi .</s>

<s>it is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming pool -- eight enlightening , vigorous , rigorous , not wholly unrewarding years .</s>

<s>we have learned a lot -- a dash of hydrochemistry here , a bit about plumbing and pump-priming there .</s>

<s>we have had sound grounding in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy .</s>

<s>we have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard birds .</s>

<s>true , our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of our neighbors have built their own pools , thereby diluting our spectacular attractions .</s>

<s>but problems cling to pools , as any pool owner knows .</s>

<s>so our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials , errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the first time -- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience .</s>

<s>where to put it
position may not be everything , but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties , social and/or physical .</s>

<s>we speak from varying viewpoints .</s>

<s>one of us has a pool set in a wooded area very near the house .</s>

<s>the other has his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill .</s>

<s>if you are dreaming of a blue , shimmering pool right outside your living room windows , close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of children , damp towels , squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated plastic toys .</s>

<s>you are likely to be nearer the truth .</s>

<s>you can also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living quarters , the greater the chance for violation of family privacy , annoying noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-clubjj attitude .</s>

<s>on the other hand , out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the pool .</s>

<s>another dilemma : as picturesque as a sylvan pond in the forest may be , trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being of a pool .</s>

<s>yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mowed .</s>

<s>as in choosing a wife , it is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be in bad weather as well as in good .</s>

<s>in the colder climes , for instance , you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when your pool will hardly look its best .</s>

<s>it may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt hay , or an ice floe studded with logs .</s>

<s>even a neat , plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold .</s>

<s>( we do , however , recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk -- flora and fauna generally -- from accidentally wintering in the pool .
)</s>

<s>probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts .</s>

<s>naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and size of your land .</s>

<s>but if space and money are no problem and small children are not on hand every day , it is certainly more restful to have your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs of the house .</s>

<s>and a good several feet around the pool should be neither greensward nor woods , but good hard pavement .</s>

<s>the placement of your pool , however , will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool owning -- those that involve your social life and those pertaining to safety .</s>

<s>coping with them demands stern discipline -- of yourself as well as of your family , neighbors , friends and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet .</s>

<s>eight years ago while we were going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period , we were each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid out nearby for the lord and master's delectation .</s>

<s>but not even our first pool-side gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies .</s>

<s>we seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards .</s>

<s>our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled .</s>

<s>had we taken a lien on a state park ?</s>

<s>not at all .</s>

<s>we had merely been discovered by the pool sharks .</s>

<s>we were in business ]
from proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step -- no more than the change from city clothes to trunks .</s>

<s>naive of us , maybe , but the results of our impulsive invitations to come over next summer and swim in our new pool were both unexpected and unsettling .</s>

<s>our book of etiquette
after the first few weeks , it was obvious that rules had to be made , laid down and obeyed -- even if our popularity ratings became subnormal as a result .</s>

<s>so rules we made , in unabashed collusion .</s>

<s>since our viewpoints in this respect coincided precisely , we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single social code for pool owners .</s>

<s>first and foremost : no one -- no , not anyone -- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his or her own circle .</s>

<s>just short of forty lashes we finally managed to coerce our children to this view .</s>

<s>their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool , but on our terms and at our times .</s>

<s>no friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning beforehand .</s>

<s>no ringers , either -- even if they are trailing legitimate invitees .</s>

<s>we want to know when the Potlatches telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring , so that we won't end up with a splashing mob that looks like Coney Island in August .</s>

<s>no young children may come without adults except for a specific , organized , chaperoned party .</s>

<s>and accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities .</s>

<s>a gaggle of gabbling mothers , backs to the pool , is no safeguard .</s>

<s>no bottle pool is tolerated -- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run .</s>

<s>( sanity , solvency and relations with our wine merchant took a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood free-drink stop .
)</s>

<s>we designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours .</s>

<s>this has saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less brutal to the young less fortunate than ours .</s>

<s>we also worked out logistics for Sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch en famille .</s>

<s>we gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides .</s>

<s>all dressing ( undressing to be more exact ) must be done in our small bath house or at the swimmers' homes .</s>

<s>( to avoid any possible excuse for a dripping parade through your house , it is a good idea to have a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between the pool , and the parking area .
)</s>

<s>we do , however , provide a limited number of extra suits , mainly for children , and we stock extra towels and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences .</s>

<s>life-preservers , the buckle-on kapok-filled kind , are held in readiness , too , for the very young .</s>

<s>preserving life and limb
safety rules , of course , are more important than all the others put together .</s>

<s>in many localities , now , the law requires all pools to be fenced , usually to a minimum height of 5 feet .</s>

<s>but fenced or unfenced , no pool-side is the place for running or horseplay .</s>

<s>we allow no underwater endurance contests , either , or inexpert versions of water polo .</s>

<s>diving boards must have non-skid surfaces ( coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine and rots quickly , but grit-impregnated paints are excellent ) .</s>

<s>and divers must be enjoined to look before they leap , either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge .</s>

<s>our pools also have wide , shallow steps -- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords .</s>

<s>all bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups .</s>

<s>when you first acquire a pool , we earnestly recommend -- for your own mental health -- a good long chat with your insurance agent .</s>

<s>you should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits .</s>

<s>soignee pools , alas , do not just happen .</s>

<s>they are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements .</s>

<s>unless you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your leisure hours nursing your pool's pristine purity , its care and feeding -- from J content to filtering and vacuuming -- is best left to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service .</s>

<s>of course , if your pool is close to the house , your wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores ( you hope ) .</s>

<s>or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers .</s>

<s>even so , every pool owner , in case of emergency , should have some idea of what makes things work .</s>

<s>a brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future crisis .</s>

<s>preserving the pool
a sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight .</s>

<s>you need more chlorine .</s>

<s>the walls feel slippery .</s>

<s>you need algaecide .</s>

<s>with or without professional help , you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse .</s>

<s>you should see to it that the trap , the dirt-catcher in front of the filter , is always clean .</s>

<s>a pool is no place for a shut trap .</s>

<s>you should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water .</s>

<s>when shed , they leave rust marks .</s>

<s>you can hope against hope that come spring cleaning , your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing and furbishing .</s>

<s>it has happened .</s>

<s>many hours of spring cleaning will be saved , however , if you remove the main drain grate when you close the pool season in the fall .</s>

<s>as the pool is emptied , stand by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet .</s>

<s>much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp , but requires dynamite if allowed to dry .</s>

<s>if you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe , you may easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out .</s>

<s>of course , when your 6-inch torrent of water is released , it may cause a lot of comment as it passes through or by neighboring properties .</s>

<s>do not forget this possibility .</s>

<s>if your pool is located on or near sloping ground , it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping out the water and then scooping out all the debris .</s>

<s>it may be true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene , but lights also attract all the insect life for miles around .</s>

<s>once on the water , these little visitors seldom leave , and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those present .</s>

<s>often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense .</s>

<s>our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible , from pipes to brushes .</s>

<s>follow pool-care instructions to the letter , and be sure that one person ( in the family or not ) is regularly responsible for each aspect of the job , with no chance for claiming , it wasn't my turn .</s>

<s>never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves -- even if the little boys do want to play space ship .</s>

<s>you may find yourself hitting bottom , literally , as you discover that water is running out even while you are putting it in .</s>

<s>draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania .</s>

<s>any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years .</s>

<s>fortunately , it is the J which has arrived at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress .</s>

<s>even if you live above that line , the J will back you , for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged .</s>

<s>new simplified packaged units , recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts , and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $600 to $900 .</s>

<s>two men can often do the installation in a day .</s>

<s>you can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house .</s>

<s>its upkeep ?</s>

<s>no less an authority than the J concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset its operating costs .</s>

<s>is it worth-while ?</s>

<s>home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted .</s>

<s>we know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable , and accurate controls assure the comfort we want .</s>

<s>we know , too , that health is never harmed by summer cooling .</s>

<s>on the contrary , there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills .</s>

<s>the filtered air benefits allergies , asthma , sinus , hay fever .</s>

<s>control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid .</s>

<s>heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive heat .</s>

<s>housekeeping is easier .</s>

<s>the cleaner air means less time spent pushing a vacuum , fewer trips to the dry cleaners , lighter loads for the washing machine .</s>

<s>the need for reupholstering , redecorating , repainting becomes more infrequent .</s>

<s>clothes hold their shape better , and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words .</s>

<s>it will improve your disposition .</s>

<s>when you're less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter .</s>

<s>the children can have their daytime naps and hot meals , and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms .</s>

<s>you'll sleep longer and better , too , awake refreshed and free of hot weather nerves .</s>

<s>you can forget about screens , and leave the storm windows up all year around .</s>

<s>best of all , central air conditioning is something you can afford .</s>

<s>like its long-lived cousin , the refrigerator , a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more .</s>

<s>that brings its per-year cost down mighty low .</s>

<s>for any house .</s>

<s>no matter what style your home is , ranch , two-story , Colonial or contemporary , central air conditioning is easily installed .</s>

<s>the equipment won't take up valuable space either .</s>

<s>it can go in out-of-the-way waste space .</s>

<s>but there's no denying that the easiest and most economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning is when you build .</s>

<s>if that's done , the house can be designed and oriented for best operation , and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself .</s>

<s>if you can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building , by all means make provision for its easy adding later .</s>

<s>manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances , and your savings over starting from scratch will be substantial .</s>

<s>if your house is to have a forced warm air system , cooling can be a part of it .</s>

<s>this costs less than having a completely separate cooling system , for your regular heating ductwork , filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling .</s>

<s>you can get year-'round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone -- high or low boy , horizontal or counterflow .</s>

<s>the units can be installed in basement , attic , crawlspace , or in a closet located in the living area .</s>

<s>the cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet .</s>

<s>from the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard , garage , carport , or basement .</s>

<s>if you plan to add cooling later to your heating system , there are things to watch for .</s>

<s>be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed .</s>

<s>they may be inaccessible later .</s>

<s>be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling .</s>

<s>this is especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone .</s>

<s>be sure you get a perimeter heating system , and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating .</s>

<s>you can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house .</s>

<s>for cooling , chilled water is circulated instead of hot water .</s>

<s>instead of radiators you'll have cooling-heating units , each with its own thermostat .</s>

<s>these systems are more expensive than year-'round forced air systems .</s>

<s>the minimum cost for an average one-story , 7-room house with basement , is likely to run $1500 above the cost of the heating alone .</s>

<s>separate systems .</s>

<s>if the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty , it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system .</s>

<s>the simplest kind of separate system uses a single , self-contained unit .</s>

<s>it is , in effect , an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled , cleaned , dehumidified air where it is wanted .</s>

<s>in a long , rambling ranch , two such units can be installed , one serving the living area , the other the sleeping zone .</s>

<s>in a two-story house , one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor , another in the attic to cool the second .</s>

<s>in each case , having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of permitting individual zone control .</s>

<s>the heat pump .</s>

<s>one of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating .</s>

<s>as you know , a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors .</s>

<s>a relatively simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward , and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned indoors .</s>

<s>up until recently , this heat pump method of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees .</s>

<s>now , the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees .</s>

<s>you can get this added heating feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone .</s>

<s>consider it as a standby setup , at negligible cost , for those emergencies when the furnace quits , a blizzard holds up fuel delivery , or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don't want to start up your whole heating plant .</s>

<s>what size conditioner ?</s>

<s>how large a cooling unit you need , and the method of its installation , depends on a variety of factors .</s>

<s>among other things , besides the nature of your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from the outside , it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup of your family .</s>

<s>families with children usually don't want the house quite so cool .</s>

<s>if you are a party thrower , you may need added capacity .</s>

<s>the body is a heat machine , and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load .</s>

<s>cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of J .</s>

<s>a J is a unit of heat , and the J rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour .</s>

<s>a very rough rule of thumb is that , under favorable conditions , you'll need 15 J of cooling for every square foot of your house .</s>

<s>this is if outdoor temperatures have a high average of 95 degrees .</s>

<s>you'll need more if the high average is above that , less if it's below .</s>

<s>coolers are also rated by tons .</s>

<s>a ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice .</s>

<s>by accepted definition , a 1-ton conditioner will provide 12,000 J of cooling in one hour .</s>

<s>you may find a conditioner rated by horsepower .</s>

<s>it is generally an inaccurate method of rating , for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor , and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you'll get .</s>

<s>a 1-hp conditioner , for example , may vary in effectiveness from under 8,000 J to well over 10,000 J .</s>

<s>the safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need , rather than trying to do this yourself .</s>

<s>don't urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough .</s>

<s>better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big .</s>

<s>here's why : reducing humidity is often as important as cooling .</s>

<s>an oversize unit will cool off your house quickly , then shut down for a long period .</s>

<s>before it cycles on again , humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low .</s>

<s>with a unit of the right size , a compressor will run continuously during hot weather , reducing humidity as evenly as it does temperature .</s>

<s>money-saving tips .</s>

<s>attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately .</s>

<s>a well-designed , 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled and heated for as little as $128 a year , or $11 a month .</s>

<s>if you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate easily , your unit will have less heat to remove .</s>

<s>keep the direct sun from reaching the house and you've won the first battle .</s>

<s>in a new house , generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution .</s>

<s>if the house you plan to buy or build won't have big overhangs , you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises , fences and awnings .</s>

<s>shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can .</s>

<s>drawn blinds and draperies do some good , but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house .</s>

<s>the more directly the sun strikes walls and roof , the greater its heat impact .</s>

<s>the way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you're going to need .</s>

<s>a shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun hits them more obliquely , can save you money .</s>

<s>you can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun , double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation .</s>

<s>restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house .</s>

<s>they're easier to shade there .</s>

<s>an attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool .</s>

<s>you'll even gain by putting your water heater outside the conditioned space , and using an electric range instead of a gas one .</s>

<s>gas adds to the moisture load .</s>

<s>insulate , weatherstrip , double-glaze to the maximum .</s>

<s>in insulation , the numbers to remember are 6-4-2 .</s>

<s>they stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation in the ceiling , 4 inches in the side walls , 2 inches in the floors .</s>

<s>such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling installation , but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling .</s>

<s>a light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per cent .</s>

<s>it costs two to three times as much to remove a J in summer as it does to add one in winter , so every solitary J is worth attention .</s>

<s>you'll foil them in droves , along with their pal humidity , by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan , a bathroom ventilator for when you shower , and an outside vent for the clothes drier .</s>

<s>keeping conditioners quiet .</s>

<s>it's no use pretending that all conditioners are quiet , but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum .</s>

<s>good workmanship is important in the installation , so if you're doing your own contracting , don't award the job on the basis of price alone .</s>

<s>avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom .</s>

<s>most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning .</s>

<s>this is particularly true in site selection .</s>

<s>you must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are ;
you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed .</s>

<s>with such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available .</s>

<s>begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible .</s>

<s>these are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies .</s>

<s>the new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site .</s>

<s>these are inexpensive and available from the U. S. Geological Society , Washington 25 , D. C. .</s>

<s>in recent years many counties and the U. S. Forest Service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use .</s>

<s>most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor's office showing ownerships of land .</s>

<s>inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation .</s>

<s>this gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons .</s>

<s>it is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site .</s>

<s>these are a great aid for planning use back at the office .</s>

<s>for site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry through the study .</s>

<s>however , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation .</s>

<s>county judges , commissioners , engineers , assessors , and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences .</s>

<s>a visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area .</s>

<s>how much study is required ?</s>

<s>this , of course , depends on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision .</s>

<s>it is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone .</s>

<s>usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions .</s>

<s>a site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little development or water .</s>

<s>the same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use .</s>

<s>in looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements , you need information to compare the site with others .</s>

<s>you need answers to four important questions .</s>

<s>what are the existing recreation features ?</s>

<s>how well can the site be developed ?</s>

<s>how useful will it be to the public ?</s>

<s>is this site available ?</s>

<s>check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site .</s>

<s>naturally , a park site with scenic views , a good lake , trees , and sand dunes , will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes .</s>

<s>quality is vitally important .</s>

<s>frontage on a body of clear , clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water .</s>

<s>some recreation features , such as scenic values and water interest , also have greater overall value than other interests .</s>

<s>one of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery .</s>

<s>it may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake , colorful rock formations , or unusual trees .</s>

<s>a site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic .</s>

<s>an area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach .</s>

<s>a site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs .</s>

<s>note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy .</s>

<s>water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site .</s>

<s>most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas .</s>

<s>this follows naturally since frontage on an ocean , stream , or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing , fishing , boating , and other water sports .</s>

<s>a body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use .</s>

<s>it also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wild life .</s>

<s>the amount of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afforded by it are important .</s>

<s>a restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use .</s>

<s>the quantity of water flow may be critical ;
a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer .</s>

<s>if the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied .</s>

<s>check the quality of the water .</s>

<s>a stream which has all of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area .</s>

<s>other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it supports , wave action , flooding , etcetera , will affect its recreation value .</s>

<s>other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests , canyons , mountains , deserts , seacoast , beaches , sand dunes , waterfalls , springs , etcetera with which the area is blessed .</s>

<s>just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance , counties should seek out these features which are distinctive of their area .</s>

<s>although the site may not contain the features themselves , there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site .</s>

<s>the route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them .</s>

<s>a group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site .</s>

<s>the fish , animals , and birds which may be found at the site are another interest .</s>

<s>fishing interest calls for a check of the species found , quantity and size , the season they are available , and the stocking program of the fish commission .</s>

<s>animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas .</s>

<s>the site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life .</s>

<s>clams , crabs , and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas .</s>

<s>each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done .</s>

<s>park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in .</s>

<s>the historical sign tells its story , but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered .</s>

<s>notice should be taken of unusual rock formations , deposits , or shapes of the earth's crust in your region .</s>

<s>those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites .</s>

<s>an old shipwreck , a high dam , an old covered bridge , a place to find agates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold , etcetera may be of interest .</s>

<s>some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient Indian village sites or hunting areas , caves , artifacts , etcetera .</s>

<s>how well can the site be developed ?</s>

<s>look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use , what can be done to correct the faults , and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites .</s>

<s>many things need to be checked : size and shape
-- the size of the area alone can be a determining factor .</s>

<s>an area may be too small for the needs of the project .</s>

<s>areas should be large enough to include the attractions , have ample space for the use of facilities needed , and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments .</s>

<s>acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones .</s>

<s>shape of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the development .</s>

<s>a large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide .</s>

<s>this is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions .</s>

<s>however , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman's trail , or include scenic strips within the park unit .</s>

<s>adjoining areas
-- the values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there .</s>

<s>for instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not .</s>

<s>the utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site .</s>

<s>topography
-- topography is very important .</s>

<s>check the elevation of the ground , degree and direction of slopes , drainage , rock outcrops , topsoil types and quality , as well as subsoil .</s>

<s>nearly level areas are required for parking areas , beaches , camp areas , ballfields , etcetera .</s>

<s>determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be .</s>

<s>water
-- in addition to its recreation interests , water is needed for drinking , sanitation , and irrigation .</s>

<s>the quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection .</s>

<s>the area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines .</s>

<s>figure the cost of providing water to the use areas .</s>

<s>plants
-- the existing plant growth calls for thorough checking .</s>

<s>look at the trees as to size and interest , the amount of shade they provide , how healthy they are , the problems of maintenance , fire hazards , wind throw , etcetera .</s>

<s>an area may have been partially logged and requires removal of stumps or clean-up .</s>

<s>some shrubs may be of good landscaping value , other areas of brush may need to be cleared .</s>

<s>the extent and location of open areas is noted .</s>

<s>exposure
-- how much will wind , rain , sun , and temperature affect the use ?</s>

<s>an area sheltered from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use .</s>

<s>the direction , velocity , and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area .</s>

<s>lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable .</s>

<s>sometimes , you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade , morning sun , or whatever may be most desirable for the use intended .</s>

<s>improvements
-- some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings , roads , utilities , cleared land , etcetera which may raise the cost of the site .</s>

<s>your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff to honor his 70th anniversary for the April issue of Sovietskaya Muzyka accepted with pleasure , because I admire the music of Prokofieff ;
and with sober purpose , because the development of Prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics .</s>

<s>the Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the United States of America was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur and very capable as a professional musician .</s>

<s>these qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-World War 1 era .</s>

<s>Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor in America was , indeed , brilliant .</s>

<s>Prokofieff's Classical Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well-trained musician still in his twenties .</s>

<s>to the Traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism ;
to the Neo-Classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world .</s>

<s>what was it to Prokofieff ?</s>

<s>a tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-Century ideas ;
a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times ;
a brilliant piece de resistance ?</s>

<s>certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon .</s>

<s>I heard the Classical Symphony for the first time when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927 .</s>

<s>all musical Paris was there .</s>

<s>some musicians were enthusiastic , some skeptical .</s>

<s>I myself was one of the skeptics ( 35 years ago ) .</s>

<s>I remember Ernest Bloch in the foyer , shouting in his high-pitched voice : it may be a tour de force , mais mon Dieu , can anyone take this music seriously ?</s>

<s>the answer is , yes ]
certainly , America took Prokofieff and his Classical Symphony seriously , and with a good deal of pleasure .</s>

<s>his life-long friend , Serge Koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston , New York , and Washington , D.C. , to which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation .</s>

<s>Chicago was also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the Love For Three Oranges , and played the first performance of his Third Piano Concerto .</s>

<s>Uncle Sam was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : The Golden Twenties .</s>

<s>we attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ;
we studied , taught , and performed his piano sonatas , chamber music , gavottes , and marches ;
we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities .</s>

<s>we unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth-Century Composers .</s>

<s>nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World -- the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated -- the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America -- the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso -- the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art -- the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms .</s>

<s>so young Prokofieff was the darling of success : in his motherland ;
in the spacious hunting grounds of Uncle Sam ;
in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant Paris -- mistress of gaiety -- excess and abandon -- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought .</s>

<s>meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing .</s>

<s>in this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , Prokofieff was recalled to his native land .</s>

<s>the world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom-loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist tyranny into cringing submission .</s>

<s>after this holocaust , a changing world occupied the minds of men ;
a world beset with new boundaries , new treaties and governments , new goals and methods , and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation -- hunger and exposure .</s>

<s>in this changed world , Prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose .</s>

<s>here , this happy , roving son of good fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world .</s>

<s>here , Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism -- producing music for the masses .</s>

<s>it is at this point in his life that the mature Prokofieff emerges .</s>

<s>one might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous .</s>

<s>but no : Prokofieff grew .</s>

<s>he accepted the environment of his destiny -- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise .</s>

<s>by 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people : I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom , but at the same time I have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody .</s>

<s>this is precisely what makes lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose -- the clarity must be new , not old .</s>

<s>how right he was ;
how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism .</s>

<s>and with what resource did Prokofieff back up his Credo of words -- with torrents of powerful music .</s>

<s>compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little Classical Symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent Fifth Symphony ;
or the Love For Three Oranges ( gay as it is ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet , the Stone Flower .</s>

<s>this masterpiece has gaiety , too , but it is the gaiety of dancing people : earthy , salty and humorous .</s>

<s>of course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them .</s>

<s>the early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience ;
the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens .</s>

<s>however , in all of Prokofieff's music , young or mature , we find his profile -- his signature -- his craftsman's attitude .</s>

<s>Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se .</s>

<s>in orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color .</s>

<s>his sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable .</s>

<s>his creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating : witty , clever , adroit , and subtle .</s>

<s>his counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick .</s>

<s>also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations , the brilliant orchestrations , the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured bass , the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound was required .</s>

<s>that Prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears , may or may not indicate that he was less of an original than we prefer to believe .</s>

<s>need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability .</s>

<s>Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated .</s>

<s>at this date , it seems probable that the name of Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History , as an effective Traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose ;
yet was never caught up in it -- never a slave to its academic dialectics .</s>

<s>certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the Western World -- not his experimentations .</s>

<s>so Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them .</s>

<s>nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances .</s>

<s>his fellow-countryman , Igor Stravinsky , certainly did not .</s>

<s>why did Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity , while Stravinsky ( who leaped into fame like a young giant ) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness ?</s>

<s>I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff's own words : the clarity must be new , not old .</s>

<s>when Prokofieff forged his new clarity of lucid , straightforward music , so difficult to compose , he shaped his talents to his purpose .</s>

<s>when Stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures , many salons , many dialectics , many personalities , he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles , determined by many disparate cultures .</s>

<s>Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people -- by the compass of their national ideas .</s>

<s>but Stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting .</s>

<s>in all his miscalculations , Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations -- representing many peoples , time periods and styles -- into his own music by warping the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiments .</s>

<s>because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic materials , and his flair for orchestrations -- his brilliant Petruchka , his savage Sacre Du Printemps , his incisive Les Noces -- the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed .</s>

<s>but time is running out , and many of Stravinsky's admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra firma .</s>

<s>his various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself : Supra-Expressionism , Neo-Paganism , Neo-Classicism , Neo-Romanticism , Neo-Jazz , Neo-Ecclesiasticism , Neo-Popularism , and most recently , Post-Serialism -- all competing with each other within one composer ]
what a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations ]
meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist ;
a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem ( The Star-Spangled Banner ) ;
a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto ;
a circus polka for elephants ;
his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular American commercial songs ]
Stravinsky , nearing the age of eighty , is like a lost and frantic bird , flitting from one abandoned nest to another , searching for a home .</s>

<s>how differently Prokofieff's life unfolded .</s>

<s>Prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction .</s>

<s>in the process , his native endowments were stretched , strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose .</s>

<s>with a large and circumspect 20th-Century technique , he wove the materials of national heroes and events , national folklore and children's fairy tales -- Slavic dances and love songs -- into a solid musical literature which served his people well , and is providing much enjoyment to the world at large .</s>

<s>of course , it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat , Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him ;
time and economic security ;
symphony orchestras , opera and ballet companies ;
choruses , chamber music ensembles ;
soloists ;
recordings ;
broadcastings ;
television ;
large and eager audiences .</s>

<s>it must be conceded that his native land provided Prokofieff with many of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive : economic security and cultural opportunities , incisive idioms , social fermentations for a new national ideology -- a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose .</s>

<s>thus in Prokofieff the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics produced one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century .</s>

<s>that his moods , even in his early years , are those of his people , does him honor , as his music honors those who inspired it .</s>

<s>that he mastered every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments , is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture ;
and perhaps of even greater significance -- his music is strong 20th-Century evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution , based on a broad Traditionalism for the creative art of music .</s>

<s>April 10 marked a memorable date in New York's musical history -- indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern United States .</s>

<s>on that date the Musicians Emergency Fund , organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes in the stock market crash , observed its 30th anniversary .</s>

<s>Roy Mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully patterned art of John Sell Cotman .</s>

<s>and like this English master , Mason realizes his subjects in large , simplified masses which , though they seem effortless , are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them .</s>

<s>as a boy Roy Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods .</s>

<s>his father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions , and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature .</s>

<s>out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on the wing -- almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape .</s>

<s>it is this subject matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors .</s>

<s>Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting .</s>

<s>like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family business which , though it was allied to art of a kind -- the design and production of engraved seals -- bore no relation to the painting of pictures .</s>

<s>but it did teach Roy the basic techniques of commercial art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia .</s>

<s>on the death of their father , they returned to their home in Batavia , New York .</s>

<s>after more years of concentrated effort , Roy and his brother Max finally established a thriving family business at the old stand .</s>

<s>during all this time Roy continued to paint , first only on weekends , and then , as the family business permitted , for longer periods .</s>

<s>gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty years , he has worked independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions .</s>

<s>but even on these , the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off ]
except for a rich friendship with the painter , Chauncey Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had -- and this was limited to a few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together -- Roy developed his art by himself .</s>

<s>in the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and then to paint .</s>

<s>he worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honors , including his election to the Academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium .</s>

<s>gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique .</s>

<s>it has been my privilege to paint with Roy Mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the vicinity of Batavia .</s>

<s>more often than not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting .</s>

<s>what I have observed time and time again is a process of integration , integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form ;
color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition ;
and that over-all , amazing control of large washes which is the Mason stylemark .</s>

<s>finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done .</s>

<s>inspiring -- yes ;
instructive -- maybe ;
duplicable -- no ]
but for the technical fact , we have the artist's own testimony : of late years , I find that I like best to work out-of-doors .</s>

<s>first I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately F inches ) in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values -- the lightest light , the middle tone , and the darkest dark -- by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns .</s>

<s>if a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture , I try to place them in the initial sketch .</s>

<s>for me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose .</s>

<s>I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ;
as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him .</s>

<s>just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition .</s>

<s>if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result .</s>

<s>out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which I call clicking .</s>

<s>speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition .</s>

<s>if I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , I mean to project equal concern for color .</s>

<s>often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat .</s>

<s>when this occurs , I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor -- if I have been working on a full sheet in the field .</s>

<s>when working from one of my sketches I square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal .</s>

<s>when this linear draft is completed , I dust it down to a faint image .</s>

<s>from this point , I paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage .</s>

<s>however , first I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines I have described .</s>

<s>then I plan my attack : the parts I will finish first , the range of values , the accenting of minor details -- all in all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness .</s>

<s>the longer I work , the more I am sure that for me , at least , a workmanlike method is important .</s>

<s>trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting .</s>

<s>as for materials , I use the best available .</s>

<s>I work on a watercolor easel in the field , and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain .</s>

<s>in my studio I work at a tilt-top table , but leave the paper unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes .</s>

<s>I have used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers , but prefer an English make , rough surface , in 400-pound weight .</s>

<s>after selecting a sheet and inspecting it for flaws ( even the best sometimes has foreign nubbins on its surface ) , I sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean , cold water .</s>

<s>then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board .</s>

<s>in addition to the usual tools , I make constant use of cleansing tissue , not only to wipe my brushes , but to mop up certain areas , to soften edges , and to open up lights in dark washes .</s>

<s>the great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist .</s>

<s>I also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large washes in the studio .</s>

<s>my brushes are different from those used by most watercolorists , for I combine the sable and the bristle .</s>

<s>the red sables are 8 ;
two riggers , 6 and 10 ;
and a very large , flat wash brush .</s>

<s>the bristles are a Fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge .</s>

<s>my usual palette consists of top-quality colors : alizarin crimson , orange , raw sienna , raw umber , burnt sienna , sepia , cerulean blue , cobalt blue , French ultramarine blue , Winsor green , Hooker's green 2 , cadmium yellow pale , yellow ochre , Payne's gray , charcoal gray , Davy's gray , and ivory black .</s>

<s>in analyzing the watercolors of Roy Mason , the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here .</s>

<s>true , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory .</s>

<s>unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate .</s>

<s>long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus -- either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ;
a middle distance often containing the major motif ;
and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky .</s>

<s>in following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created .</s>

<s>when painting , Mason's physical eyes are half-closed , while his mind's eye is wide open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey .</s>

<s>he does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ;
rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia .</s>

<s>it is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment .</s>

<s>his pictures generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale ;
they universalize in terms of weather , skies , earth , and people .</s>

<s>by dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , Roy Mason has found a particular niche in American landscape art .</s>

<s>living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the Creator of it all .</s>

<s>the artist was born in Gilbert Mills , New York , in 1886 , and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to California , he lived in western New York , in Batavia .</s>

<s>when I looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March 15th , I realized that Roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist : the water sign of Pisces ( February 18 thru March 20 ) .</s>

<s>and how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in American Artist again , in his natal month of March ]
over the years , beginning in 1929 , Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals ;
two Ranger Fund purchase awards ;
the Joseph Pennell Memorial Medal ;
two American Watercolor Society prizes ;
the Blair Purchase Prize for watercolor , Art Institute of Chicago ;
and others in Buffalo , New York , Chautauqua , New Haven , Rochester , Rockport , and most recently , the $300 prize for a watercolor at the Laguna Beach Art Association , he was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy in 1930 ) , and elevated to Academicianship in 1940 .</s>

<s>the Russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the American gymnasts in the 1960 Olympics for one reason -- they were better .</s>

<s>they were better trained , better looking , better built , better disciplined and something else -- they were better dancers .</s>

<s>our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance .</s>

<s>the Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics .</s>

<s>but why gymnastics at all ?</s>

<s>and is the sport really important ?</s>

<s>after all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics competition .</s>

<s>but if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ?</s>

<s>it is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics .</s>

<s>taking first things first , let's understand the sport called gymnastics .</s>

<s>it is made up of tumbling , which might be said to start with a somersault , run through such stunts as headstands , handstands , cartwheels , backbends , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work .</s>

<s>the apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in American gyms , but about 1930 it was dropped in favor of games .</s>

<s>the parallel bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football .</s>

<s>but the Russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance .</s>

<s>the gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection .</s>

<s>in short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well .</s>

<s>the addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top athlete , soldier or citizen .</s>

<s>another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life .</s>

<s>( an enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days .</s>

<s>most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries .
)</s>

<s>in most sports , as in most walks of life , the angels are on the side of those who begin young , and the Russian competitor of 16 has at least thirteen years of training behind him .</s>

<s>the American is very lucky if he has three .</s>

<s>if a nation wished to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nations , it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that plague American schools .</s>

<s>first of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both .</s>

<s>oddly enough , it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty .</s>

<s>certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic averages , since alert children work better .</s>

<s>Russia knows this , and that is why there were over 800,000 competing for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team .</s>

<s>eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself .</s>

<s>we could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people .</s>

<s>and what has dancing to do with all this ?</s>

<s>a great deal .</s>

<s>Russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus .</s>

<s>well-stretched , trained in posture and coordinated movement , and wedded to rhythm , they presented the audiences in Rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic contest .</s>

<s>American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons .</s>

<s>they saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace .</s>

<s>they were further stripped of old wive's tales by seeing the slender , lovely Russian girls performing feats requiring tremendous strength and with not one bulging muscle .</s>

<s>President Kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation .</s>

<s>if we wait until children are in junior high or high school , we will never manage it .</s>

<s>to be fit , one has to start early with young children , and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance .</s>

<s>if the dance teachers of America make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible , we will be that much ahead .</s>

<s>school teachers , all too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrators .</s>

<s>there should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand , and also how to help other children learn it .</s>

<s>they should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught .</s>

<s>dance teachers can respond to President Kennedy's request not only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes for strength and flexibility .</s>

<s>very little in today's living provides the strength we need and nothing provides the flexibility .</s>

<s>dancers do have flexibility .</s>

<s>they often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength .</s>

<s>ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results , considering the amount of physical training they have had , will be very disappointing .</s>

<s>even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas .</s>

<s>this isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11-year-old boys in America cannot chin themselves once , and that English school girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) .</s>

<s>the only area in which American boys hold their own is the baseball throw .</s>

<s>the chinning bar
for arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended .</s>

<s>it should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a little to one side .</s>

<s>those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin-up each time they pass under it .</s>

<s>those who are too weak , should climb on the chair and , starting at the top of the chin , let themselves slowly down .</s>

<s>when they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin-up .</s>

<s>parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home .</s>

<s>the horse kick
arm , shoulder , chest , upper and lower back strength will be aided with the horse kick .</s>

<s>start on hands and feet .</s>

<s>keeping the hands in the starting position , run in place to a quick rhythm .</s>

<s>after this has become easy , use slower and slower rhythms , kicking higher and higher .</s>

<s>follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on all fours , kicking as high as possible .</s>

<s>push-ups
push-ups are essential , but few have the strength for them at first .</s>

<s>start on the knees in a large circle .</s>

<s>fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor .</s>

<s>push back up and repeat .</s>

<s>do this exercise six times each class period .</s>

<s>as strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward .</s>

<s>start by falling forward to a point close to the feet , and , as strength improves , fall farther and farther out .</s>

<s>try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands .</s>

<s>the push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide .</s>

<s>let the body down slowly , taking at least five seconds for the letting down .</s>

<s>five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up .</s>

<s>handstands
handstands come after arms , chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength .</s>

<s>of course those who have developed more will find them easier .</s>

<s>start with the class standing in a circle , with weight on the right foot and the left extended a little way into the circle .</s>

<s>at first each child should do a kick-up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help .</s>

<s>drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back .</s>

<s>the left will follow at once .</s>

<s>the right will land first , followed by the left .</s>

<s>return to the standing position .</s>

<s>care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible .</s>

<s>this will prevent flat falls and toe injuries .</s>

<s>bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper .</s>

<s>eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg .</s>

<s>the child should then bring both legs together overhead , point the toes and tighten the seat muscles .</s>

<s>be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time .</s>

<s>backbends
the backbend is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics , and , as with all acrobatics , the sooner begun the better the results .</s>

<s>have the class lie supine with knees apart and bent .</s>

<s>place flat palms on either side of the head a few inches away from the ears , fingers pointing toward the shoulders .</s>

<s>arch the back upwards to make a bridge .</s>

<s>be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling .</s>

<s>as flexibility improves , the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher .</s>

<s>later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover .</s>

<s>back circle
to further increase back flexibility , work on the back circle .</s>

<s>have the class lie prone .</s>

<s>place the hands in front of the chest .</s>

<s>keep the legs straight and the toes pointed .</s>

<s>straighten the arms slowly , this arches the back .</s>

<s>at the peak of the arch , tip the head back and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head .</s>

<s>improvement can be measured by the lessening distance between toes and head .</s>

<s>somersaults
the last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program is the somersault , or forward roll .</s>

<s>this used to be part of every child's bag of tricks , but few children can do it today ;
some are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright .</s>

<s>for most small children , learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can .</s>

<s>after it has been seen , have the child start on a mat on hands and knees ( a thin , inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling ) .</s>

<s>he places the hands on either side of the head , keeping the chin down on the chest .</s>

<s>he then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides it over .</s>

<s>one or two practice runs should be sufficient for solo .</s>

<s>if , however , the child is weak , overweight , or afraid , more help will be needed .</s>

<s>when the child raises his seat into the air , the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis ;
then no matter what happens , the child's performance will be controlled .</s>

<s>by lifting the seat upwards a little , the weight is taken off the neck and the back is kept rounded .</s>

<s>these are beginnings , but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed by a strong , flexible body ( we are not talking of eccentric extremes ) .</s>

<s>even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal , the good tumbler will be a better dancer , a better athlete , and a human being with a greater margin of safety in any activity .</s>

<s>it is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative .</s>

<s>and dancing school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also contributes to this essential early training -- and can contribute even more .</s>

<s>the host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality .</s>

<s>when we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering .</s>

<s>the author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities .</s>

<s>the benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery .</s>

<s>we use the term bio-medicine because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research .</s>

<s>electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy machine .</s>

<s>in this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow's commonplace equipment originates .</s>

<s>from the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research .</s>

<s>ultraviolet microscopy
many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation .</s>

<s>this stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside .</s>

<s>a completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-TV system to view the results .</s>

<s>fig.</s>

<s>1 is a simplified block diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical Electronics Center of Rockefeller Institute .</s>

<s>by combining the talents of a medical man , Dr. Aterman , a biophysicist , Mr. Berkely , and an electronics expert , Dr. Zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes .</s>

<s>three different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources .</s>

<s>these wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ;
the specimen is magnified by the microscope .</s>

<s>instead of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the J camera does the looking .</s>

<s>the microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum , which means that all lenses must be quartz .</s>

<s>the video signal is amplified and then switched , in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength , corresponding to red , green , or blue , is seen .</s>

<s>( note : because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another , the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated by a synchronous motor .</s>

<s>this assembly also supplies a 20-cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry .
)</s>

<s>this is the same system as was used in the field-sequential color-TV system which preceded the present simultaneous system .</s>

<s>three separate amplifiers then drive a 21-inch tricolor tube .</s>

<s>the result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths .</s>

<s>many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light , absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum .</s>

<s>different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color .</s>

<s>where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows or nothing at all , ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation into a color J picture reveal a wealth of detail .</s>

<s>at the present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it .</s>

<s>breathing -- electronically analyzed
the medical title of Lobar Ventilation In Man by Drs.</s>

<s>C. J. Martin and A. C. Young , covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process .</s>

<s>at the University of Washington Medical School , the electronics group has developed the Respiratory Gas Analyzer shown in Fig.</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>this unit , affectionately dubbed The Monster , can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's breathing .</s>

<s>in the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobes of one lung , the total volume of inhalation per breath , the flow of air from both lobes , and the pressure of the two lobes with respect to each other .</s>

<s>usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill , standing still , or in some other medically significant position .</s>

<s>from the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail .</s>

<s>heart-measuring techniques
the original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat , but today's techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chambers , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat .</s>

<s>for many of these measurements the chest must be opened , but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed .</s>

<s>a group of researchers at the University of Washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques .</s>

<s>one simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched .</s>

<s>a balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed .</s>

<s>sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy .</s>

<s>the travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second ;
thus it takes about 16 Msec.</s>

<s>to traverse 25 mm.</s>

<s>of tissue .</s>

<s>a sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue evaluation .</s>

<s>in addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique .</s>

<s>the Doppler effect , using ultrasonic signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel .</s>

<s>a still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself .</s>

<s>it uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream .</s>

<s>the latter measures the heat carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow .</s>

<s>it is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left ventricle , to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself .</s>

<s>this pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made .</s>

<s>a simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in Fig.</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>outputs of the two systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge , followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder .</s>

<s>from this doctors can read heart rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power .</s>

<s>radio-transmitter pills
several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers .</s>

<s>this original capsule contained a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm.</s>

<s>in diameter .</s>

<s>battery life limited the use of this pill to about 8 to 30 hours maximum .</s>

<s>a refinement of this technique has been described by Drs.</s>

<s>Zworykin and Farrar and Mr. Berkely of the Medical Electronics Center of the Rockefeller Institute .</s>

<s>in this novel arrangement the pill is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing transducer .</s>

<s>as shown in Fig.</s>

<s>4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc.</s>

<s>bursts .</s>

<s>the energy received by the pill causes the resonant circuit to ring on after the burst and this ringing takes place at the resonant frequency of the pill .</s>

<s>these frequencies are amplified and detected by the J receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the pill has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained .</s>

<s>one of the advantages of this method is that the pill can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions .</s>

<s>applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments .</s>

<s>sonar in medical research
one of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human body .</s>

<s>our readers are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects .</s>

<s>various methods of pulsing , scanning , and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines , map ocean floors , and even communicate under water .</s>

<s>in medicine the frequencies are much higher , transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller , and different scanning techniques may be used , but the principles involved are the same as in sonar .</s>

<s>because the body contains so much liquid , transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels .</s>

<s>bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals .</s>

<s>based on this phenomenon , a number of investigators have used this method to look through human organs .</s>

<s>a good example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers presented by Dr. G. Baum who has explored the human eye .</s>

<s>he can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma .</s>

<s>the method used to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrated in Fig.</s>

<s>6 .</s>

<s>the transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath , not shown .</s>

<s>for display , Dr. Baum uses a portion of an F , an airborne radar indicator , and then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record .</s>

<s>a typical sonogram of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical parts , is shown in Fig.</s>

<s>5 .</s>

<s>the frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc.</s>

<s>and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter .</s>

<s>the transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90-degree arc in front of the eye to look into all corners .</s>

<s>the total picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period .</s>

<s>Drs.</s>

<s>Howry and Holmes at the University of Colorado Medical School have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results .</s>

<s>by submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on , they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck , as shown in Fig.</s>

<s>7 , as well as many other hitherto impossible insights .</s>

<s>Oersted's boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life .</s>

<s>he was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on the island of Langeland in the south-central part of Denmark on August 14 , 1777 .</s>

<s>his father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family , let alone educate them in a town without even a school .</s>

<s>the two older boys , Hans and Anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German ;
his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish .</s>

<s>other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading , German , and Danish in the informal curriculum .</s>

<s>Oldenburg's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned , such as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching .</s>

<s>from the town surveyor , Hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university student , some academic subjects .</s>

<s>the mayor of the town taught them English and French .</s>

<s>whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed on to each other ;
they read every book that they could borrow in the village .</s>

<s>at 12 , Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science .</s>

<s>his earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life .</s>

<s>in 1793 the brothers decided to enter the University of Copenhagen ( founded in 1479 ) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session .</s>

<s>while Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied law .</s>

<s>the brothers continued to help each other during their studies , sharing a joint purse , lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt .</s>

<s>they supplemented their income by small government assistance , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could .</s>

<s>so impressive were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later wrote , to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination ;
there is a struggle there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom of utterance there , which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society .</s>

<s>I lived in this onward-driving contest where each day overcame a new difficulty , gained a new truth , or banished a previous error .</s>

<s>he openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing about science .</s>

<s>in this third year at the university , Hans , in 1797 , was awarded the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on Limits Of Poetry And Prose .</s>

<s>he completed his training in pharmacy also , taking his degree with high honors in 1797 , and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine .</s>

<s>he proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices .</s>

<s>ferment of scientific activity
Hans' student days were at a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in France , Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent .</s>

<s>the new century opened with Oersted beginning his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university .</s>

<s>he was stirred by the announcement of Volta's discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis .</s>

<s>the following year he devoted to the customary Wanderjahr , traveling in Germany , France , and the Netherlands , meeting the philosophers Schelling , Fichte , and Tieck .</s>

<s>he also met Count Rumford ( born Benjamin Thompson in Woburn , Mass. )</s>

<s>who was then serving the Elector of Bavaria , and the physicist Ritter ;
these were Oersted's main contacts in science .</s>

<s>from Gottingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , the first question asked everywhere is about galvanism .</s>

<s>as everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes I have invented , I have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes ( in Copenhagen I used 30 ) and intend to carry it with me .</s>

<s>Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks , continuing their correspondence after he left .</s>

<s>with Ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host's fertile but disorganized mind .</s>

<s>Oersted remodeled Ritter's notes into an essay in French which was submitted to the Institut De France for its annual prize of 3,000 francs .</s>

<s>the sound discoveries of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him .</s>

<s>in May , 1803 , Ritter , in another flight of fancy , wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy .</s>

<s>he related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries .</s>

<s>thus , 1745 corresponded to the invention of the Leiden jar by Kleist , 1764 that of the electrophorus by Wilcke , 1782 produced the condenser of Volta , and 1801 the voltaic pile .</s>

<s>Ritter proceeded , you now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 , you will have to reckon .</s>

<s>this we might well witness .</s>

<s>Ritter died in 1810 and Oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it .</s>

<s>in 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for the university's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist .</s>

<s>however , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals .</s>

<s>in 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the Copenhagen University , though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 .</s>

<s>during Oersted's attendance at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences .</s>

<s>he was , however , fortunate in his contact with Prof. J. G. L. Manthey ( 1769-1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the Lion Pharmacy in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him .</s>

<s>Manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted's disposal during and after his graduation .</s>

<s>in 1800 , Manthey went abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion Pharmacy .</s>

<s>in February 1801 , Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead .</s>

<s>in the following year , 1803 , Oersted , simultaneously with Davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic battery more than did salts .</s>

<s>eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to galvanizing .</s>

<s>he assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood .</s>

<s>the university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level .</s>

<s>his broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many doors to him .</s>

<s>his friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong .</s>

<s>the years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again , but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his first journey .</s>

<s>in Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws of nature in German and this was issued in French translation ( Paris , 1813 ) under the title Recherches Sur l'identite Des Forces chimiques et electriques , a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists .</s>

<s>his interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated .</s>

<s>Chapter 8 is entitled On Magnetism and in it are included such remarks as , one has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces .</s>

<s>the great resemblance between electrical and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison .</s>

<s>it is true that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication ;
but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference .</s>

<s>the form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form .</s>

<s>there , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism .</s>

<s>but in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty , and not a thing which is contrary to it .</s>

<s>one could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat , which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature , just as electrical bodies do .</s>

<s>it is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature , as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb .</s>

<s>by that , one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces .</s>

<s>an attempt should be made to see if electricity , in its most latent stage , has any action on the magnet as such .</s>

<s>his plan and intent were clearly charted .</s>

<s>Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and political discussions .</s>

<s>in one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to dogma , in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship .</s>

<s>he continued as a popular lecturer .</s>

<s>he devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current .</s>

<s>in 1819 under royal command he undertook a very successful geological expedition to Bornholm , one of the Danish islands , being one of three scientists in the expedition .</s>

<s>it was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition , Lauritz Esmarch , that Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow .</s>

<s>together they also developed a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of copper , thereby producing stronger currents .</s>

<s>Esmarch was among those who witnessed Oersted's first demonstration of his discovery .</s>

<s>discovery of electromagnetism
the association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades .</s>

<s>electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles .</s>

<s>in the late 1700's Beccaria and Van Marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it .</s>

<s>Beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic .</s>

<s>the resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise .</s>

<s>the experiments of Romagnosi and others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these two primary forces .</s>

<s>Oersted's own earlier experiments were unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenters , laid the conducting wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it .</s>

<s>the sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of Oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820 .</s>

<s>at this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle .</s>

<s>no one material is best for all situations .</s>

<s>selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem .</s>

<s>fence-line feeding .</s>

<s>animals eat only from one side , so the fence-line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk .</s>

<s>these bunks also serve as a fence , so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence .</s>

<s>because of their location , on the edge of the feed lot , fence-line bunks are not in the way of mechanical manure removal .</s>

<s>filling these bunks by the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more time and operations .</s>

<s>all-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year .</s>

<s>this will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall .</s>

<s>marketing in the new decade will be no picnic -- for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20-25 yrs.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>why ?</s>

<s>companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies -- in modern equipment and new processes , enlarged R & D facilities , faster new product development .</s>

<s>many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge .</s>

<s>given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yrs.</s>

<s>?</s>

<s>based on our experience with clients , we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups -- the market place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management .</s>

<s>1 .</s>

<s>problems in the market greater price-consciousness
.</s>

<s>there has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent years ;
there is every indication it will continue .</s>

<s>frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers .</s>

<s>despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before -- traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer .</s>

<s>here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target : has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ?</s>

<s>have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ?</s>

<s>have you actually checked out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem ?</s>

<s>increased customer sophistication .</s>

<s>average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims , partly because of widespread criticism of such assertions .</s>

<s>this problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses .</s>

<s>have you examined this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company ?</s>

<s>greater demand for services .</s>

<s>need for service is here to stay -- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties .</s>

<s>there are two reasons for this .</s>

<s>first , most products tend to become more complex .</s>

<s>second , in a competitive market , the customer feels his weight and throws it around .</s>

<s>providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product .</s>

<s>too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction .</s>

<s>good service starts with product design and planning : many products seem to be designed for a production economy , not for a service one .</s>

<s>proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization , and your distributor organizations , not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations .</s>

<s>have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention ?</s>

<s>wider discretionary choices for customers .</s>

<s>in spending his money today , the consumer is pulled in many directions .</s>

<s>to the manufacturer of the more convenient-type product -- the purchase of which can be switched , delayed , or put off entirely -- the implications are important .</s>

<s>your competition is now proportionately greater -- you are competing not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products .</s>

<s>many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer's dollar being spent on their particular products .</s>

<s>has your company thought through its strategy in this whole discretionary buying area ?</s>

<s>geographic shift of customers .</s>

<s>the trends have been in evidence for many years -- population shifts to the Southwest and Far West , and from city to suburbs .</s>

<s>these shifts will continue in the next 10 yrs.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation , strength of distributor organizations , and even plant location ?</s>

<s>market concentration and distribution in fewer accounts .</s>

<s>we have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry -- at both the manufacturing and retail ends .</s>

<s>instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts .</s>

<s>the change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention -- practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted .</s>

<s>have you examined these trends , forecast the effects , and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances ?</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>problems in marketing methods more private label competition .</s>

<s>in the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade .</s>

<s>as mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the distributor's profits -- which is , in effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do .</s>

<s>average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded .</s>

<s>moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted on high quality -- and the customer seems to have caught on .</s>

<s>if you are up against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position ?</s>

<s>if private brand competition hasn't been felt in your product field as yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ?</s>

<s>less personal salesmanship .</s>

<s>display merchandising , backed by pre-selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make strides in the sixties .</s>

<s>it has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program .</s>

<s>how can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are still important ?</s>

<s>if you have a higher-quality product , how can you make it stand out -- justify its premium price -- without the spoken word ?</s>

<s>salesmanship is still necessary , but it's a different brand of salesmanship .</s>

<s>have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products ?</s>

<s>have you studied the caliber and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements for effective marketing ?</s>

<s>are you experimenting with different selling slants in developing new customers ?</s>

<s>higher costs of distribution generally .</s>

<s>some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure , some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain niceties and flourishes .</s>

<s>no manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved .</s>

<s>the use of bulk handling is continuously growing .</s>

<s>computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels .</s>

<s>selective selling -- concentrating sales on the larger accounts -- has been used effectively by some manufacturers .</s>

<s>there may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain .</s>

<s>do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully -- and with some imagination ?</s>

<s>in your sales force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high-quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen ?</s>

<s>will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share ?</s>

<s>in one company covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men , the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>as a result , distribution costs were cut , customer relations improved .</s>

<s>distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties -- and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job .</s>

<s>higher costs of advertising and promotion .</s>

<s>from the manufacturer's point of view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties .</s>

<s>the controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion .</s>

<s>the architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building .</s>

<s>ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables , workshops or panel discussions -- whatever they are called -- on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled down crux of the matter is education .</s>

<s>it is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more .</s>

<s>the element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure .</s>

<s>this would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer's training .</s>

<s>we may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject .</s>

<s>the real question that follows is -- how are those four years used and what is their value as training ?</s>

<s>the American Institute of Interior Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course .</s>

<s>an examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design , for the most part schools accredited by membership in the National Association of Schools of Art , and a further on the spot inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations .</s>

<s>one or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions .</s>

<s>the suggested course of the A.I.D.</s>

<s>was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities .</s>

<s>obviously , the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated .</s>

<s>without comparing the relative merits of the two courses -- architecture versus interior design -- let us examine the educational needs of the interior designer .</s>

<s>to begin with , what is an interior designer ?</s>

<s>the Dictionary Of Occupational Titles published by the U. S. Department of Labor describes him as follows : designs , plans and furnishes interiors of houses , commercial and institutional structures , hotels , clubs , ships , theaters , as well as set decorations for motion picture arts and television .</s>

<s>makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture , floor coverings , wall decorations , and determines color schemes .</s>

<s>furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval .</s>

<s>makes necessary purchases , places contracts , supervises construction , installation , finishing and placement of furniture , fixtures and other correlated furnishings , and follows through to completion of project .</s>

<s>in addition to this the U. S. Civil Service Bureau , when examining applicants for government positions as interior designers , expects that when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them .</s>

<s>he must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the furnishings .</s>

<s>this seems like a large order .</s>

<s>the interior designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance .</s>

<s>yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice it .</s>

<s>and further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society .</s>

<s>few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum .</s>

<s>it is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise .</s>

<s>the old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations .</s>

<s>yet even here many a problem is presented ;
as in a recent design competition with a floor plan and the simple command -- design a luxury apartment ;
no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical area or local social necessities -- simply a luxury apartment .</s>

<s>working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design .</s>

<s>it is possible , of course , to work on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get the feel of real interior design demands .</s>

<s>unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule .</s>

<s>it is like medical schools in India where , in that fairy-land of religious inhibition , the dissection of dead bodies is frowned upon .</s>

<s>instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants .</s>

<s>thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience .</s>

<s>in the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use .</s>

<s>but to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable .</s>

<s>consultation with architects , clients , real estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work .</s>

<s>fortunately , although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow -- that the student already is in the trade .</s>

<s>even the history of furniture can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern slides .</s>

<s>here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced .</s>

<s>the professional organizations such as American Institute of Interior Designers , National Society of Interior Designers , Home Fashions League and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work .</s>

<s>certainly every educator involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations .</s>

<s>not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject .</s>

<s>participation for the educator in this case , however , would have to be raised to full and complete membership .</s>

<s>the largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog .</s>

<s>this anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students .</s>

<s>the professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice .</s>

<s>this seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands .</s>

<s>in one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools .</s>

<s>that is in the continuance of the grandfather clauses in their membership requirements .</s>

<s>when these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth .</s>

<s>long hard years of on the job training had brought them to their competence .</s>

<s>the necessity of that day has long disappeared .</s>

<s>there is plenty of opportunity for proper education today .</s>

<s>it is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand .</s>

<s>the reason and the day of grandfather clauses has long since passed .</s>

<s>no one can deny that these back door admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies .</s>

<s>beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves .</s>

<s>it will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students .</s>

<s>the local decorator who rushes in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications .</s>

<s>nor will the hack , the Jack-of-all-trades , still found in some of the smaller art schools , suffice .</s>

<s>only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design .</s>

<s>at the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art .</s>

<s>this kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer .</s>

<s>we must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments of teaching -- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres .</s>

<s>considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable .</s>

<s>in all degree courses in interior design a number of academic or general studies courses are included .</s>

<s>it is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English , history , psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior design , as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects .</s>

<s>the proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed .</s>

<s>the matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account .</s>

<s>one technical question of school organization comes to mind here .</s>

<s>for proper accreditation of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate .</s>

<s>since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed .</s>

<s>indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at all .</s>

<s>the question , however , cannot be ignored for long .</s>

<s>the basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree .</s>

<s>most professors in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers .</s>

<s>one solution is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute .</s>

<s>it is a sort of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it .</s>

<s>this brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general .</s>

<s>only the independent art schools , that is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations .</s>

<s>it has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department .</s>

<s>this , plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department , yet , nevertheless , claiming that they teach interior design , has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior design .</s>

<s>in spite of this , many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject .</s>

<s>there will be no mitigation of these offences until all art schools , whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation -- as do medical schools -- by an art accreditation group such as the National Association of Schools of Art .</s>

<s>independent art schools granting degrees must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group .</s>

<s>?</s>

<s>if you have an annual or regular physical examination program , is it worth what it is costing you ?</s>

<s>a program to fit your needs
consider what you can afford to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee benefit program .</s>

<s>too many plant officials are all too eager to buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works for another plant .</s>

<s>but even if that other plant employs the same number of workers and makes the same product , there are other facts to consider .</s>

<s>how old is your working force ?</s>

<s>what's your profit margin ?</s>

<s>in what section of the country are you located ?</s>

<s>are you in a rural or urban area ?</s>

<s>these factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program .</s>

<s>above all , don't set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good will .</s>

<s>unions stress fringe benefits , but the individual hourly worker prefers cash every time .</s>

<s>aim to balance your employee benefit package .</s>

<s>some plants go overboard on one type of fringe -- say a liberal retirement plan -- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere .</s>

<s>they're asking for union trouble .</s>

<s>communications
if you want credit for your employee services program , let your workers know what they're entitled to .</s>

<s>encourage them to exercise their benefits .</s>

<s>this can be done by stories in your house organs , posters , special publications , letters to workers' homes as well as by word of mouth through your chain of command .</s>

<s>some companies find a little imagination helpful .</s>

<s>Hallmark Cards , Inc. , Kansas City , Mo.</s>

<s>, has a do-it-yourself quiz game called Benefit Bafflers , which it distributes to employees .</s>

<s>J & J Dietetic Laboratories , Inc. , Columbus , gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook -- each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular fringe .</s>

<s>U. S. Rubber Company , New York , passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits .</s>

<s>the blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance
package , for example , costs $227.72 .</s>

<s>insurance have the insurance company or your own accounting department break down the cost of your insurance package periodically .</s>

<s>you may find certain coverage costing much more than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions .</s>

<s>check to see if some of your benefits -- such as on-the-job disability pay -- can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you .</s>

<s>use deductable insurance wherever feasible .</s>

<s>it can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates .</s>

<s>also , beware of open-end policies , especially in the medical field .</s>

<s>this will mean that every time there's an increase in hospital rates your cost will go up in like manner .</s>

<s>put a dollar-and-cents limit on benefits .</s>

<s>don't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death .</s>

<s>generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement .</s>

<s>special time off
in granting bereavement leaves , specify the maximum time off and list what the worker's relation to the deceased must be to qualify .</s>

<s>thus , you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin's funeral .</s>

<s>also , reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you'll probably never use it .</s>

<s>coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated .</s>

<s>vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time .</s>

<s>if coffee is sold at the cafeteria , let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group .</s>

<s>consider installing supplemental serving lines in production areas .</s>

<s>make sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers , if you are supplying the coffee .</s>

<s>otherwise , you may be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers .</s>

<s>retirement policies
keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company .</s>

<s>and so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age .</s>

<s>make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements tied into your pension plan .</s>

<s>younger men usually don't think of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they're liable to change jobs several times before settling down .</s>

<s>choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans .</s>

<s>there are two sides of a coin for this decision .</s>

<s>workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to .</s>

<s>and they can at least collect the money they put in , plus interest , when they leave the company .</s>

<s>a non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he retires .</s>

<s>thus , there is an added incentive to stay on the job .</s>

<s>holidays
make sure you don't pay for holidays that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working .</s>

<s>these include : leaves of absences , illnesses , and layoffs .</s>

<s>consider adopting a system of holidays in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant .</s>

<s>it's usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods .</s>

<s>for example , the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington's birthday .</s>

<s>this reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups .</s>

<s>require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay .</s>

<s>this cuts the absentee rate .</s>

<s>eating facilities
consider using vending machines rather than subsidized cafeterias .</s>

<s>latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices , and at a profit to you .</s>

<s>if a concessionaire runs the cafeteria , keep an eye out for quality and price .</s>

<s>if the soup tastes like dishwater , your employees won't blame the concessionaire .</s>

<s>you'll take the rap .</s>

<s>check your cafeteria location to make sure it's convenient for most employees .</s>

<s>you may save valuable production minutes with a change .</s>

<s>vacations
spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks .</s>

<s>this will cut the expense of vacation replacements .</s>

<s>and with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates .</s>

<s>also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation .</s>

<s>you might try providing standard vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous year .</s>

<s>the long and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into a new era .</s>

<s>modern times have changed the world beyond recognition .</s>

<s>the early years of the twentieth century seem very far away .</s>

<s>but with all the changes in philosophy , dress and terrain -- a few things remain constant , including the devotion of Americans to the great field sports , hunting and fishing .</s>

<s>as the generations move on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports .</s>

<s>sporting firearms change , markedly for the better .</s>

<s>just as modern transportation has outmoded the early Studebaker covered wagon , the demand of today's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment .</s>

<s>the American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide action firearms .</s>

<s>and millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition , designed for today's hunting and target shooting .</s>

<s>and due to modern resource-use and game management practices , there is still game to shoot , even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and water .</s>

<s>present conservation practices regard wildlife , not as an expendable natural resource , but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped .</s>

<s>unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states , on shooting preserves ( one of the newer phases of modern game-management ) for five and six months each year .</s>

<s>close to two million game birds were harvested on 1,500 commercial and private shooting preserves , and on State Game Commission-controlled upland game areas during the 1960-61 season .</s>

<s>the shooting development program of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines , many national weeklies and the trade papers .</s>

<s>the most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting preserves .</s>

<s>this has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the New York staff of the Sportsmen's Service Bureau , and the J shooting preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 .</s>

<s>following the kick-off of J shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting took place in Washington , D.C. .</s>

<s>the group known as the American Association for Health , Physical Education , and Recreation ( a division of the National Education Association ) initiated a conference which brought together representatives of the National Rifle Association , J and the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers .</s>

<s>this meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as the Outdoor Education Project .</s>

<s>the Outdoor Education Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life .</s>

<s>the various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development .</s>

<s>but with the exception of professional athletes , few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman .</s>

<s>following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by J director Dr. Julian Smith , today thousands of secondary schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical education and recreation programs .</s>

<s>SAAMI's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education .</s>

<s>personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education .</s>

<s>considering that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach .</s>

<s>in 1959 J shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports .</s>

<s>this program is now nationally known as Teen Hunter Clubs .</s>

<s>Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation .</s>

<s>the first program was sponsored by Abraham & Strauss , Hempstead , New York , under the direction of Special Events director Jennings Dennis .</s>

<s>other pilot programs were conducted by J & J , Babylon , New York ;
J. L. Hudson , Detroit ;
Joseph Horne , Pittsburgh .</s>

<s>other J activities followed , conducted by shopping centers , department stores , recreation equipment dealers , radio-TV stations , newspapers , and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources .</s>

<s>SAAMI's field men have served as consultants and/or have participated in 75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40,000 enthusiastic young Americans .</s>

<s>through the efforts of J shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a few .</s>

<s>the continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand .</s>

<s>while individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it .</s>

<s>help is needed from dealers , at the grass-roots level .</s>

<s>the American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association .</s>

<s>since J conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults .</s>

<s>we trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment .</s>

<s>are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports ?</s>

<s>are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and girls , who will grow up to enjoy a traditional American way of life -- ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ?</s>

<s>is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ?</s>

<s>would you like to organize Teen Hunters Clubs , shooting programs , and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting preserves ?</s>

<s>this beach campground with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use .</s>

<s>with the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now .</s>

<s>there were umbrella tents , wall tents , cottage tents , station wagon tents , pup tents , Pop tents , Baker tents , tents with exterior frames , camper trailers , travel trailers , and even a few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps .</s>

<s>moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves , lanterns , coolers , bedding , games , fishing tackle , windbreaks and sunshades .</s>

<s>we saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this 70-mile-long National Seashore Recreation Area .</s>

<s>dealers would do well to visit such a campground often , look at the equipment and talk with the campers .</s>

<s>here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry .</s>

<s>camping is big and getting bigger .</s>

<s>no one knows where it will stop .</s>

<s>almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets .</s>

<s>you read various guesses on how many Americans are camping .</s>

<s>the number depends on who is talking at the moment .</s>

<s>the figures range as high as 15 million families .</s>

<s>I've heard 10 million mentioned often , but I'm more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping .</s>

<s>seven million families would total 30 million Americans or more .</s>

<s>consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable .</s>

<s>more campers than campsites
harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with .</s>

<s>they are struggling to meet the demand for camping space , but families are being turned away , especially on holiday weekends .</s>

<s>the National Parks , always popular camping places , are facing the same pressure .</s>

<s>the National Park Service hopes by 1966 to have 30,000 campsites available for 100,000 campers a day -- almost twice what there are at present .</s>

<s>the U.S. Forest Service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests and is increasing its facilities steadily .</s>

<s>but the campers still come .</s>

<s>they bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding .</s>

<s>they bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits .</s>

<s>they come prepared for family fun because Americans in ever-growing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance .</s>

<s>why they keep coming
there are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds .</s>

<s>among them , according to the U.S. Department of Commerce , are : ( 1 ) shorter work weeks , ( 2 ) higher pay , ( 3 ) longer paid vacations , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) earlier retirement , and ( 6 ) more education .</s>

<s>the more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn .</s>

<s>camping is family fun , and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever saw before .</s>

<s>but make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy .</s>

<s>here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford .</s>

<s>the American Automobile Association , computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , comes up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29 .</s>

<s>the J then splits it down this way : $10.50 for meals , $9.50 for lodging , $7 for gas and oil , and $2 for tips and miscellaneous .</s>

<s>what does the camping couple do to this set of figures ?</s>

<s>the $9.50 for lodging they save .</s>

<s>because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that $10.50 food bill along with most of the tip money .</s>

<s>the automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they can't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping along the way .</s>

<s>where Americans used to think of a single vacation each summer , they now think about how many vacations they can have .</s>

<s>long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year .</s>

<s>and even if they stay in resorts part of the time , they might , if the right salesman gets them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces .</s>

<s>it would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts of home .</s>

<s>they're not .</s>

<s>home is the place to find the comforts of home .</s>

<s>they're buying fun and adventure and family experiences .</s>

<s>but it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become .</s>

<s>this is no longer a way of life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy .</s>

<s>today's campers want comforts , and they have them .</s>

<s>and this helps explain why so many people are now going camping .</s>

<s>it's fun , and it's easy -- so easy that there is time left after cooking , and tent keeping , for the women to get out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families .</s>

<s>camp meals are no great problem .</s>

<s>neither are beds , thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags .</s>

<s>neither are shelters , because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper .</s>

<s>but there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs .</s>

<s>throughout history , the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others -- for good or bad .</s>

<s>since the Industrial Revolution , when factories emerged , this classical pattern has been followed .</s>

<s>until recently .</s>

<s>there have always been tales of disillusionment -- the competent technician who became an administrator , willingly or not , and found he didn't like it ;
the scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper work ;
and much more commonly in recent years , the engineer who found that other duties interfered with -- or eliminated -- his engineering contributions .</s>

<s>there have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work , to their own and the public's dissatisfaction and loss .</s>

<s>this has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology .</s>

<s>the remedies have been many and varied -- attempts to teach management techniques -- either in plant , at special schools , or in university crash courses -- provision of management-trained assistants or associates .</s>

<s>but the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer .</s>

<s>some men have no talent for or interest in management ;
forcing them into management can only create trouble .</s>

<s>the old shop adage still holds : a good mechanic is usually a bad boss .</s>

<s>yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition of managerial status as the gage of success .</s>

<s>labor fights to change its collar from blue to white .</s>

<s>all grades of management seek more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures .</s>

<s>as several recent books have over-emphasized , we have become the most status-conscious nation in the world .</s>

<s>what can be done for the individual contributor who is extremely important -- and likely to be more so -- in the operation of the technically oriented company ?</s>

<s>he is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and outside ;
usually concerned about America's belief that attainment and success are measured in dollars and titles .</s>

<s>yet titles are traditionally given only to management men , and income tends to rise with title .</s>

<s>even the college professor in America has been affected .</s>

<s>it is , as one engineer says , indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he could employing managerial skills .</s>

<s>this difficulty arises even though we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course .</s>

<s>this leads one to conclude , as you have , that there is inevitably more prestige in a management position in the minds of our people .</s>

<s>nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers .</s>

<s>so we asked such men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on the dual-road-up problem -- and more importantly -- their solutions .</s>

<s>in the paragraphs that follow , we quote from 32 men who are identified on the final page .</s>

<s>first : what title , what setup ?</s>

<s>among the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of General Electric .</s>

<s>this is not a mutually exclusive plan ;
there is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the technical or the managerial path upward .</s>

<s>further , the management path does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by the more technical path .</s>

<s>it is common to shift back and forth , working up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions .</s>

<s>actually , there are a number of individual-contributor positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide services operation that are filled by men with successful managerial experience who are currently broadening their capabilities .</s>

<s>also , moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man's recognition as a technical expert .</s>

<s>as examples at J : Glen B. Warren , formerly manager of the Turbine Division , widely recognized as a turbine designer .</s>

<s>the late W. R. G. Baker , a pioneer in television design and long-time J & J of the Electronics Division , and later , by his own choice , an individual consultant .</s>

<s>Harold E. Strang , expert in switchgear design , for a long period J & J of the Measurements & Industrial Products Division , and who currently , approaching retirement , is vice-president and consulting engineer in the Switchgear & Control Division .</s>

<s>in the J plan , a number of individual contributors have positions and compensation higher than those of many managers .</s>

<s>these positions carry such titles as : Consultant , Advanced Development Consulting Engineer , Consulting Engineer , Heat Transfer Consulting Electrical Engineer , Senior Electrical Engineer , Senior Physicist .</s>

<s>Westinghouse has a similar system , with two classifications representing various levels of competence on the strictly technical side : consulting engineer or scientist , as the case may be , and advisory engineer or scientist .</s>

<s>many companies have systems , particularly in J & J , which work more or less well , depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration , as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotations .</s>

<s>another factor that may hold hope is for parallel recognition is , as one man says it : that the fad for educating top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically trained approach .</s>

<s>senior staff engineer ?</s>

<s>one company instituted , early in 1959 , a vertical classification system consisting of four levels .</s>

<s>there is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks ;
the top non-supervisory level , senior staff engineer , enjoys status and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision .</s>

<s>the second level , senior engineer , rates slightly below first-level supervision .</s>

<s>the expectation is that first-level supervisors will be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third engineering level , with very few coming from the first level .</s>

<s>the company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for non-supervisory engineers , but probably not into executive levels .</s>

<s>in this organization , about half of the engineers with 15 or more years of employment are in supervision , engineering or elsewhere .</s>

<s>this reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products -- which are not military .</s>

<s>several other examples : central and satellite
we have over 20 divisions -- each of which has an engineering department headed by a chief engineer .</s>

<s>we have set up a central J & J department , as well as engineering-management departments -- about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants .</s>

<s>a separate research department is , of course , confined to new or future designs .</s>

<s>part of this headquarters staff , however , are engineering managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters management .</s>

<s>these headquarters engineers , headed by the vice-president -- engineering , counsel and advise divisional managers and chief engineers on product problems as well as aid with design ;
and many are engineers who have been advanced from the divisions .</s>

<s>these men are considered managers of engineers .</s>

<s>they must learn to wear several hats , so to speak , working with management , sales and engineering problems related to the product .</s>

<s>we do not have people in our organization termed consultants or fellows , who are specialists in one particular technical subject .</s>

<s>I suppose it is because we are just not big enough .</s>

<s>we have a few consultants -- retired engineers retained and called in on certain problems .</s>

<s>the only fellows in our company are those who have been honored by J , J or J .</s>

<s>I am sure that the engineer who enters management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities than he would have as a technical specialist -- because of his wider accountability .</s>

<s>another structure
we have tried to make both paths attractive , so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction in either .</s>

<s>one way to formalize this is in the job structure .</s>

<s>we have these positions , which compare directly : F above these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president of J , J & J .</s>

<s>the latter jobs include major management responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily through the engineering-management side .</s>

<s>we have not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable to our higher levels of management , but I believe we will trend in this direction but not to exceed vice-president .</s>

<s>top job : research scientist .</s>

<s>approximately four years ago , we initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons .</s>

<s>the highest position is known as a research scientist .</s>

<s>this approach has not been entirely satisfactory .</s>

<s>the primary deterrent appears to lie with the technical people themselves , and their concept of what constitutes status in present-day society .</s>

<s>scientists who agitate hardest for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept it .</s>

<s>we have discovered that the outward trappings such as private offices and private secretaries are extremely important ;
and although we have attempted to provide these status symbols , support of the dual-ladder plan has been half-hearted despite the creation of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that of men in top managerial positions .</s>

<s>a serious problem accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level .</s>

<s>with no set standards , there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance .</s>

<s>promotion is too often based on longevity and time in salary grade instead of merit .</s>

<s>if no specific organization plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level , the result is a department top-heavy with high-level , high-salaried personnel .</s>

<s>staff engineer dept.</s>

<s>manager
we have two approaches for the technical man : the position of staff engineer , which is rated as high in salary as department manager ;
and an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department managers and project engineers as much as possible , thus allowing them more time for strictly technical work .</s>

<s>these are only halfway measures , and the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man in industry to progress without limit in salary and prestige .</s>

<s>a complete plan
we have made limited application of the parallel ladder plan .</s>

<s>the highest rated non-supervisory engineering title is research engineer .</s>

<s>the salary schedule permits remuneration greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering supervision ( engineering section head ) .</s>

<s>we also have an engineering section head -- research engineer classification which has salary possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer .</s>

<s>above this point there is no generally used parallel ladder .</s>

<s>we also do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a professional and also to give public recognition to individual technical competence .</s>

<s>these include encouragement of , and assistance to , the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers .</s>

<s>we have two media for publicizing individual technical activity , a magazine widely distributed both within and without the company , and an information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes of all engineers .</s>

<s>publicity is given to the award of patents to our engineers and financial support is provided for individual membership in technical societies .</s>

<s>a recent , and more pertinent action , has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the vice-president for Engineering .</s>

<s>this function is staffed by engineers chosen for their technical competence and who have the title , member of the technical staff .</s>

<s>salaries compare favorably with those paid to the first two or three levels of management .</s>

<s>additional symbols of status are granted , such as reserved parking , distinctive badge passes authorizing special privileges , and a difference in the treatment of financial progress through merit .</s>

<s>we presently are involved in inaugurating a new development center .</s>

<s>operations of this nature offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status .</s>

<s>all scientific staff members will have the title , research-staff member .</s>

<s>the salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the scientific community's acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific field .</s>

<s>contrary to usual organization-position evaluations , the position to which research-staff members report administratively will not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member , therefore , are not necessarily evaluated as highly .</s>

<s>these recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence .</s>

<s>it is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts .</s>

<s>fundamental to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige is the fact that , in the business community , prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in the management functions .</s>

<s>sixty miles north of New York City where the wooded hills of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there is a new home development called Oakwood Heights .</s>

<s>as a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $14,000 range .</s>

<s>but Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular .</s>

<s>its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point .</s>

<s>this is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State Pipeline Corporation , with principal offices in New York State .</s>

<s>its president is Otis M. Waters , partner in the law firm of Timen & Waters , 540-K Chrysler Bldg.</s>

<s>, New York City .</s>

<s>vice-president is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter .</s>

<s>Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-Craft Distributors , Inc. , Newburgh , N.Y. .</s>

<s>the idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty .</s>

<s>not a year goes by but what several local companies in the U.S. and Canada , even overseas , write to Fueloil & Oil Heat to inquire if it's feasible and where it is being done .</s>

<s>its editors only knew of one example to point to , a public housing development of 278 homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March , 1950 issue .</s>

<s>this has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered .</s>

<s>rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family .</s>

<s>common complaints included Mrs. Murphy leaving her windows open all the time , a fresh air fan , or the family was visiting Aunt Minnie with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil .</s>

<s>as a result of that attitude , others have been discouraged from trying central distribution .</s>

<s>a new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at Oakwood Heights .</s>

<s>called a Slo-Flo meter it was designed for this job by Power Plus Industries of Los Angeles , a key individual being Don Nelson .</s>

<s>Tri-State has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern , principal heating states .</s>

<s>there's an advantage in having a firm like Tri-State headed by a lawyer .</s>

<s>the earlier New Haven development was public housing , so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture .</s>

<s>these have to do with property rights , municipal official attitudes and a host of others .</s>

<s>in working out the practical legal conclusions President Waters was not thinking only of this pilot project , for it is planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments nationally .</s>

<s>it is always difficult , or at least time-consuming , to get approval of any kind of line under a public street , as one example .</s>

<s>to overcome this , the builder lays and completes the street himself , then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual easement for the oil lines .</s>

<s>when a family buys a home the title is subject to a perpetual easement to Tri-State .</s>

<s>for the central storage , Tri-State buys one acre , buries its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece .</s>

<s>in other words , the whole storage and pipeline system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather to Tri-State .</s>

<s>how does Tri-State get its revenue from this plan ?</s>

<s>it leases the whole facility to a large oil company , at least large enough to have a strong credit position .</s>

<s>this first test is being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least 15 years .</s>

<s>the amount paid by the oil company to Tri-State for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes , is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable to both parties .</s>

<s>on this first venture the central storage is 20,000 gallons , in two tanks , or an average of 400 gallons for each of the 50 homes .</s>

<s>the supplier delivers at his convenience in transport loads , so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies .</s>

<s>however , that is not all he has to do .</s>

<s>he must undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heating .</s>

<s>in the present project the heating is by circulating hot water from Paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups .</s>

<s>again , the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best .</s>

<s>for this first development the supplier signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor .</s>

<s>the major gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost is low .</s>

<s>initial considerations
the officers of the new corporation have naturally explored many angles , as well as personalities that might be affected .</s>

<s>for example , the officials of Poughkeepsie town ( township ) where the project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow clearing problem .</s>

<s>the central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing , with fewer trucks in the residential streets .</s>

<s>the Public Service Commission has ruled that this is not a public utility , subject to their many regulations .</s>

<s>several financial institutions , both banks and insurance companies , have been sounded out .</s>

<s>they like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong oil companies .</s>

<s>the Government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special stipulation .</s>

<s>there must be a restriction in the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil , an obvious precaution , since the account is permanently wedded , just like with gas or electricity .</s>

<s>for a few details of the system the lines are 1-1/4'' X-Tru-Coat , a product of Republic Steel Corp. , and all lines are welded .</s>

<s>they are laid a minimum of 24'' deep and in some areas four feet down , particularly under roads , to stay clear of all other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy trucking .</s>

<s>the meter is mounted high on the basement wall .</s>

<s>its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read , even into tenth gallons .</s>

<s>it will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour .</s>

<s>Ritter , the builder , is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters .</s>

<s>he believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available .</s>

<s>it would be pretty difficult to install a Tri-State system in old neighborhoods , and that's an understatement .</s>

<s>the job of getting property easements and street easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging .</s>

<s>but in a new development where everything starts from scratch the solutions are simple .</s>

<s>future plans
what does Tri-State actually want to do , now that it has the meters under franchise and certain phases of its piping system in the patent applied for stage ?</s>

<s>it wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including its facility in their new home projects , by financing and installing the storage , piping and meters , and leasing these for 15 years , with renewal options , to a strong oil company .</s>

<s>it may also work in one other way -- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters , letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities .</s>

<s>this whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers , for the idea has so often been mentioned , somewhat wistfully .</s>

<s>but it's too early yet to go visit Oakwood Heights .</s>

<s>only eight of the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on June 8th ;
others were building .</s>

<s>the big tanks were at the site but still sunning themselves .</s>

<s>a big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches , and the town building inspector was paying a friendly , if curious , visit .</s>

<s>the oilheating industry is looking up , led by a revival of research and development .</s>

<s>a primary ingredient in these fields is imagination , and Tri-State Pipeline Corporation deserves a very good mark .</s>

<s>every year about this time National Gargle Your Cooling System week rolls around .</s>

<s>it pays in the long ( hot ) run to take good care of the water works .</s>

<s>do it this way for the summer gargle : first , drain that old coolant down the storm sewer .</s>

<s>don't save the anti-freeze , even if it the expensive permanent type .</s>

<s>the word means it won't boil away easily , nothing else .</s>

<s>the rust inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year , and you don't want to risk the rust that two years' use could mean .</s>

<s>pitch it out .</s>

<s>if a lot of rust shows in the drain , use a good flushing cleaner .</s>

<s>then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor .</s>

<s>of course , you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators .</s>

<s>now , check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections , around the freeze-out plugs , gaskets , water pump seals and heater fittings .</s>

<s>next , run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat opens , and then look for leaks again .</s>

<s>be sure the bugs and dirt are blown out of the radiator fins .</s>

<s>use the air hose for this job .</s>

<s>check the temperature gage and be sure it is working .</s>

<s>if you use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as Dowguard be sure to check it .</s>

<s>Dow says that the fluid can be used now for two years .</s>

<s>check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer .</s>

<s>take precautions now , to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms this summer .</s>

<s>don't let your mechanics pull the thermostats out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours .</s>

<s>spring and summer may be here officially , but those thermos stay in .</s>

<s>the fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from any water cooled vehicle , will greatly increase the fuel consumption , reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators .</s>

<s>if you run into excess plug fouling on one truck , check to be sure that the rig has a thermostat .</s>

<s>the thermostat is important to get your engine up to operating temperature quickly , and to keep it running at its most efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant .</s>

<s>are you paying too much for your truck insurance ?</s>

<s>there's a good chance you are doubling on some coverage , not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut .</s>

<s>have a talk with your insurance agent .</s>

<s>be careful that you keep adequate coverage , but look for places to save money .</s>

<s>first go over the type of coverage you now have .</s>

<s>look for these features which may mean you can save : duplicate coverage .</s>

<s>avoid doubling up on the same item .</s>

<s>for example , don't pay in a truck policy for medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy .</s>

<s>does your policy have a lay-up clause ?</s>

<s>this means that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days , insurance can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to you .</s>

<s>this applies to repair work of winter storage .</s>

<s>the figure five is important in insurance .</s>

<s>with many company policies you get a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs .</s>

<s>this means either cars or trucks .</s>

<s>discounts run up to 2% of cost .</s>

<s>usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan .</s>

<s>for example : if your bodily injury claims start payment after the first $250 , a 25% premium saving is often made .</s>

<s>in the period since the end of World War 2 -- a period coinciding with merchandising demands for the colorful , the unusual , and the original in signs and displays -- plastics have come on so strong that today they are the acknowledged leaders in the field .</s>

<s>the importance of the sign industry to the plastics industry , however , is not in terms of volume alone .</s>

<s>designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings of other industries .</s>

<s>many of today's developments in thermoforming stem from original work done with signs and displays ;
the art of preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers ;
and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons , medallions , etc.</s>

<s>, owes much to the field , as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent plastics .</s>

<s>there is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below .</s>

<s>the concept of trans-illumination ( as shown by the photo on p. 92 ) , as just one example , offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems -- no matter what industry is involved .</s>

<s>a volume market
according to a recent Wall Street Journal survey , plastics units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales .</s>

<s>five years ago , they had only 10% of the market , with the remainder firmly entrenched in the stronghold of neon tubing .</s>

<s>and it's far from the end for plastics .</s>

<s>industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during the 1960's will be of plastic construction .</s>

<s>evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies in the field as Advance Neon Sign Co. , Los Angeles , Calif. .</s>

<s>four years ago , the company's entire line was devoted to neon signs ;
today , 85% is in plastics .</s>

<s>from the volume standpoint , the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive .</s>

<s>aggregate sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million .</s>

<s>currently , there are some 6000 companies in the field , ranging from small firms with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities for production of metal , electrical , and plastic components .</s>

<s>why the trend to plastics ?</s>

<s>what accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the sign and display field ?</s>

<s>out of many factors which might be cited , five are most important : 1 .</s>

<s>plastics combine such properties as built-in color , light weight , optional transparency or translucency , resistance to corrosion , as well as the ease of fabrication .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>plastic signs are economical .</s>

<s>according to one major producer , materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately 25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit .</s>

<s>shipping cost is also reduced ;
a 3-by-6-ft. plastic sign weighs about 120 lb.</s>

<s>, compared to 275-300 lb.</s>

<s>for neon .</s>

<s>the weight advantage , plus greater durability of the plastic unit , yields a saving of about one-fifth in shipping .</s>

<s>the lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings are needed .</s>

<s>finally , maintenance costs on plastic signs are much lower than on fragile neon signs .</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>they offer exceptional design freedom , making it possible to incorporate contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer .</s>

<s>vacuum- and pressure-formed sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded plastics .</s>

<s>pre-decoration , low-cost molds , and the freedom to form large and small , thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the industry .</s>

<s>4 .</s>

<s>plastic signs work around the clock .</s>

<s>internal illumination , protected from the elements , gives them powerful visual appeal at night ;
during daylight hours their brilliant colors command attention and interest .</s>

<s>5 .</s>

<s>advances in equipment and fabrication techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide choice of production techniques , ranging from injection molding for intricate , smaller-size , mass-production signs ( generally 5000 units is the minimum ) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs .</s>

<s>among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding .</s>

<s>what plastics to use ?</s>

<s>for outdoor signs and displays , acrylic , with its outstanding optical characteristics , weather resistance and formability , strongly dominates the picture .</s>

<s>at present , both the familiar cast acrylic and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers , with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total .</s>

<s>of a new methyl methacrylate monomer designated as Monocite J 100 , which was developed specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and lighting industry .</s>

<s>sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs only one-third as much as glass , is impervious to all kinds of weather , and will not yellow .</s>

<s>its high impact strength , even at low temperatures , resists chipping , cracking , and crazing , according to Du Pont .</s>

<s>cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed signs , background panels , and molded or formed letters because of its exceptional toughness , ease of forming , and excellent weathering properties .</s>

<s>its clarity and good optical properties are other important factors .</s>

<s>new to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which the two sheets of the laminate are of different color .</s>

<s>thermoforming the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical way to produce a two-color sign .</s>

<s>( see J , Mar.</s>

<s>1961 , p. 98 ) .</s>

<s>for specialized types of displays , such as large three-dimensional units reproducing a product , package , human or animal figures , etc.</s>

<s>, reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols are other materials frequently used .</s>

<s>a relative newcomer in outdoor signs is Mylar polyester film , now used as a printed overlay for trans-illuminated signs ( see below ) .</s>

<s>for outdoor signs and displays , where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a factor , the choice of plastics is almost unlimited .</s>

<s>here may be found regular and impact styrene , cellulose acetate , cellulose butyrate and cellulose propionate , acrylic , vinyl , expandable styrene foam , and polyethylene .</s>

<s>the final choice of material depends upon such factors as costs , method of fabrication , degree of complexity , number of units required , time available for tooling , and projected life expectancy of the unit .</s>

<s>often , the finished sign or display incorporates several types of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques .</s>

<s>trans-illuminated billboards
one of the most significant advancements in design of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard , now being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as Advance Neon Sign Co. , Los Angeles , and Industrial Electric Inc. , New Orleans , La.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>the essential difference between the new trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former , constructed of translucent plastic panels , are lighted from within .</s>

<s>with the source of light behind the copy , there is no loss of lumen output , as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light .</s>

<s>also , the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure and cannot obstruct the view of the sign .</s>

<s>the copy itself , including any text or illustrations , is reproduced in full color directly on a thin Mylar polyester film by a photo screen process .</s>

<s>the film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign , and also to be stripped off for replacement by new copy as required .</s>

<s>spare sets of face panels simplify the change from one copy or message to another ;
new panels are exchanged for the old right in the field on a single trip .</s>

<s>panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied .</s>

<s>signs of this type have already made their appearance in several larger cities , and others are on the way .</s>

<s>it is believed that these boards will , within the next few years , replace many of the conventional flood-lighted boards now in use .</s>

<s>trans-illuminated signs also show versatility in other directions .</s>

<s>as used by Industrial Electric Inc. , the film panels are printed one at a time , as are 24-sheet posters .</s>

<s>thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent plastics faces ;
they can also be applied to opaque panels for use on cutouts , or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces .</s>

<s>in this way , the sign maker has an economical means for displaying uniform copy on different sign media .</s>

<s>recently Industrial Electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern plastic materials -- a revolving spectacular sign .</s>

<s>comprised of 16 triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections , it makes it possible to combine three different signs in a single unit .</s>

<s>the triangles automatically revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec.</s>

<s>of viewing time for each poster subject .</s>

<s>sixteen panels , each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft. wide , make up the 25-ft. length of the sign .</s>

<s>changeable letters fill many needs
perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this complex field -- changeable signs .</s>

<s>signs are meant to convey a message , and in most cases , this requires words and letters .</s>

<s>frequently , the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products , price changes , etc.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>the huge market for changeable signs has spurred a universal demand for individual plastic letters , in all shapes and sizes -- and a number of companies are set up to supply them .</s>

<s>here are some of the newer items currently available : Poster Products Inc. , Chicago , Ill. : a changeable copy and display sign which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of colors , onto which are mounted snap-in letters , figures , or words screened on acetate or other types of sheet stock .</s>

<s>the background , which is available in various widths and continuous lengths , is extruded with parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely .</s>

<s>the Adaptaplex Co. , Beaverton , Ore. : letters molded of butyrate , available in several sizes in either red or black .</s>

<s>ideal for merchandising use , they are weather-resistant , and have mounting pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern background panel .</s>

<s>for large letters , e.g.</s>

<s>thermoformed of acrylic or butyrate , there are other techniques .</s>

<s>for example , in a typical store installation , fifty 24-in.</s>

<s>and six 36-in.</s>

<s>red acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background .</s>

<s>the fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb.</s>

<s>each made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic angle brackets cemented to the letters .</s>

<s>stainless steel screws were used to minimize corrosion stains .</s>

<s>for mounting to corrugated plastic backgrounds , very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings , its ends twisted behind the panels .</s>

<s>large injection-molded letters are also available for sign installations .</s>

<s>Wagner Sign Service Inc. , Chicago , for example , supplies them in several colors , in heights of 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 17 inches .</s>

<s>they are molded of a special weather-resistant formulation of Tenite butyrate .</s>

<s>also available from this company are Snug-Grip Plasti-Bars , extruded of transparent acrylic material , which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material .</s>

<s>made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft. , the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back of the letters .</s>

<s>still another approach to the changeable letter type of sign is a modular unit introduced by Merritt Products , Azusa , Calif. .</s>

<s>this vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in.</s>

<s>( or smaller ) panels formed of 0.080-in.</s>

<s>clear butyrate sheet stock , masked and sprayed on the rear side .</s>

<s>finished signs are produced by sliding the separate letter panels into channels of 0.025-in.</s>

<s>aluminum , which may be mounted to various surfaces .</s>

<s>the sheets are extruded of Tenite butyrate by Jet Specialties Co. , Los Angeles , Calif. .</s>

<s>on large-area units , where additional structural requirements are imposed , one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed channels ( e.g.</s>

<s>right-angled corrugations ) of the acrylic or butyrate .</s>

<s>joined side by side , such channels make possible construction of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft. high and of unlimited width .</s>

<s>letters may be wired to the face of the combined channels , painted on the first surface , or handled in other ways .</s>

<s>new rule no.</s>

<s>2 :
don't build from the outside in -- try to build from the inside out
.</s>

<s>don't insert your components into fixed openings , they may or may not fit ;
position your components before you close them in .</s>

<s>for example : don't wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances .</s>

<s>it's a lot quicker and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect the end wall after they are all in place .</s>

<s>set your bathtub before you close in the end of the bathroom .</s>

<s>don't try to wrestle a 400-lb.</s>

<s>tub F through a narrow doorway .</s>

<s>finish your plumbing before you frame it in ( most economical framing is a thin non-bearing partition on either side of the pipes ) .</s>

<s>finish installing and connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them in .</s>

<s>there is no better way to waste time than trying to install a furnace in a finished F closet .</s>

<s>don't position your studs before you insert your windows in conventional construction ;
that way you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the window .</s>

<s>you can save all that shimming time if you set your windows in one , two , three order -- first the stud on one side , then the window , then the stud on the other side .</s>

<s>install your disappearing stair ( or stairs ) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before you drywall the ceiling .</s>

<s>don't close in your house until everything has been carried in .</s>

<s>last wall Bob Schmitt erects is the wall between the house and garage .</s>

<s>that way he can truck his parts right indoors and unload them under the roof .</s>

<s>no auto maker would dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons in the block .</s>

<s>and trailer makers , those most industrialized and therefore most efficient of homebuilders , say they save hundreds of dollars by always building from the inside out .</s>

<s>new rule no.</s>

<s>3 : rethink everything to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling offers you .</s>

<s>this revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less news of all , because : 1 .</s>

<s>it makes it easy to handle much heavier units , so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated components like those shown in the pictures alongside .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>it makes materials handling the only construction cost that ( like earthmoving and roadbuilding ) should be lower today than in 1929 .</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>it changes the answers to who should do what , and where ?</s>

<s>it lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases the chance for shop fabrication , where almost everything can be made better and cheaper .</s>

<s>4 .</s>

<s>it changes the answers on when to do what at the site .</s>

<s>for example , instead of putting in your driveways last ( as many builders do ) you can now save money by putting them in first .</s>

<s>instead of closing the house in first ( as most builders do ) you can now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to ( see J 121 ) .</s>

<s>5 .</s>

<s>it changes the answers on builder-dealer relations .</s>

<s>not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs by buying direct and short-cutting the dealer .</s>

<s>but now many of these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything just where it is needed -- drywall inside the house , siding along the sides , trusses on the walls , roofing on the roof , etc.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>says Clarence Thompson : we dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder cheaper than he could do it himself .</s>

<s>the revolution now under way in materials handling makes this much easier .</s>

<s>the revolution is well under way , but much more remains to be done .</s>

<s>five years ago a House & Home Round Table cosponsored by the Lumber Dealers' Research Council reported unhappily : only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads ;
only one box car in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads ;
only one producer in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads ;
only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads .</s>

<s>so from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling ( most of it inefficient ) add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost of housing .</s>

<s>that House & Home Round Table was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials handling , says Clarence Thompson , long chairman of the Lumber Dealers' Research Council .</s>

<s>it made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer , carrier , equipment maker , dealer , and builder , all working together to cut the cost of materials handling .</s>

<s>before that we lumber dealers were working almost single-handed on the problem .</s>

<s>here is where things stand today :
1 .</s>

<s>almost all of the 3,000 lumber dealers who cater primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year's new houses are mechanized .</s>

<s>there are few areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything at lower cost just where his workmen will need it .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>practically all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized or unitized for mechanical handling -- including lumber , asphalt shingles , glass block , face brick , plaster , lime , hardboard , gypsum wallboard and sheathing , cement , insulation sheathing , floor tile , acoustical tile , plaster base , and asbestos shingles .</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>truck and materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding need .</s>

<s>for some significant new items see the pictures .</s>

<s>4 .</s>

<s>more than 50% of all lumber is unitized ;
an J survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will strap their shipments for mechanized handling .</s>

<s>of these , 376 said they make no extra charge for strapping in standard units , because they save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost .</s>

<s>most of the others will swallow their $.50 to $3 charge rather than lose a good customer .</s>

<s>with a 15,500-lb.</s>

<s>fork-lift , dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for $.30/mbf compared with $1.65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time , says James Wright of J .</s>

<s>5 .</s>

<s>lumber dealers and lumber manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments -- 48'' wide by a nominal 30'' high ( or six McCracken packets 24'' wide by nominal 7'' high ) .</s>

<s>these units make it easy to load as much as 48,000 J ( say 120,000 J in a 50' box car ) much more than the average for loose-loaded cars .</s>

<s>6 .</s>

<s>the railroads have responded by adding 20,000 more box cars with doors 12' or wider for forklift unloading ( a 21% increase while the total number of box cars was falling 6% ) and by cutting their freight rates twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars .</s>

<s>first was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40,000 J ;
later came a 1961 cut on the West Coast ( still pending elsewhere ) of $.07/cwt on 70,000 J carloads ( which works out to more than $4/mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70,000 J .</s>

<s>7 .</s>

<s>more unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars , and J studies show that flat cars loaded with the new Type 6-B floating-load method can be unloaded for as little as $.054/mbf .</s>

<s>for long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof paper .</s>

<s>this costs from $.75 to $2.30/mbf , but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open .</s>

<s>these carriers cut handling costs for the dealer -- and the builder .</s>

<s>says J James Wright : since 1958 carriers that move material from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes than any of the dealer's other equipment .</s>

<s>the reason : today's components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled by a truckdriver and a helper .</s>

<s>so manufacturers have pioneered a new type of vehicle -- the self-unloading carrier .</s>

<s>it cuts the lumber dealer's cost because it takes only one man -- the driver -- to unload it , and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand unloading .</s>

<s>and it helps the builder because it can handle a more efficiently packaged load , can deliver it to the best spot ( in some cases , right on the roof or inside the house ) , and never takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it .</s>

<s>says Wright : our survey shows that one third of the retail dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling in the coming two years .</s>

<s>and most of the gain will be in self-unloading vehicles .</s>

<s>new rule no.</s>

<s>4 :
restudy what your men do , to help them waste less of the time you pay for .</s>

<s>half the manhours you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right , so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right time , or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection , or you bought cheap materials that took too long to fit , or your workmen had to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip .</s>

<s>even America's most efficient builder , Bob Schmitt of Berea , hopes to cut his labor costs another $2,000 per house as a result of the time-&-motion studies now being completed on his operation by industrial efficiency engineers from the Stanley Works .</s>

<s>already this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from 170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion .</s>

<s>builder Eddie Carr of Washington , past president of J , cut his bricklaying costs $150 a house by adopting the J masonry process worked out after careful time-&-motion studies by the Structural Clay Products Research Foundation to help bricklayers do better work for less .</s>

<s>a midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand bricks from $81 to $43.50 by adopting this same process , cut them another $7.50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient , easy-to-spot 100-brick packages .</s>

<s>the J process , with its precision corner-posts , its precision guide lines , its working level scaffold , and its hand-level brick supply takes eight manhours to get set , but once ready it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day .</s>

<s>see page 156 .</s>

<s>one good way to cut your labor waste is to make sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew .</s>

<s>reports Jim Lendrum : by studying men on the job , we found that two men -- a carpenter and a helper -- can lay a floor faster than three .</s>

<s>we found that three men -- two carpenters and a helper -- can put up wall panels or trusses more economically than four men -- because four men don't make two teams ;
they make one inefficient three-men-and-a-helper team .</s>

<s>we found that wherever you can use two teams on a job , five men , not four , is the magic number .</s>

<s>no house was ever built that could not have been built better for less if the work had been better planned and the work better scheduled .</s>

<s>new rule no.</s>

<s>5 :
don't waste any $.10-a-minute time on green lumber to save $.03 a stud
.</s>

<s>this is the most penny-wise , pound-foolish chisel a builder can commit .</s>

<s>green lumber was all very well back in the days of wet plaster , when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum .</s>

<s>but now that all production builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels , green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford .</s>

<s>green studs cost about $.65 ;
dry studs cost less than $.03 more .</s>

<s>so if a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste even 20 seconds , the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry stud .</s>

<s>there comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone .</s>

<s>not necessarily to be off all by ourselves , but away from the crowds and common happenstance .</s>

<s>if you've travelled in Europe a time or two , it is quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the Atlantic .</s>

<s>following a guide , and gratefully so , is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new .</s>

<s>however , after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas , the places and forums , the churches and museums , the palaces and castles , and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe , you'll want to change your course and follow the by-roads at will , far from the market places .</s>

<s>the champagne at Troyes , the traditional capital of the champagne country , has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de la Paix or at Tour D'Argent .</s>

<s>you can relive history and follow , in fancy , the Crusaders in their quest for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi , an ancient town in the heel of Italy's boot .</s>

<s>and you don't meet the folks from home in Northwest Spain which has remained almost untouched by time and tourists since the Middle Ages .</s>

<s>time stands still as you climb the narrow , stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain slopes or wander through story-book towns , perched atop lofty crags , their faces turned to the sea .</s>

<s>they've been there since the days of the Moors and the Saracens .</s>

<s>and what better way to end a day than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman's village on the Mediterranean ?</s>

<s>an almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road .</s>

<s>for those who need or want and can afford another car , buying one and driving it on the grand tour , then shipping it home , is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself pilgrimage .</s>

<s>then , of course , there are those of us who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car .</s>

<s>the answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one .</s>

<s>it is that elemental .</s>

<s>almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you .</s>

<s>you can call one of the car rental services directly ( Hertz , Avis , Auto-Europe Nationalcar Rental , and others ) and ask them to reserve a car of your choice , and some transportation lines offer this service as well .</s>

<s>with few exceptions , your car will be waiting for you at dockside , airport , railroad station or hotel when you arrive , oftentimes at no additional cost .</s>

<s>you can wait , of course , until you arrive in Europe before renting your car .</s>

<s>the disadvantages to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models readily available or you may have to wait a few days or , during the busy tourist season , when cars are in great demand , you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at all .</s>

<s>since charges are relatively the same , reserving a car before you leave for Europe will assure you of having one on tap when you want it .</s>

<s>for those who plan to travel to Europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave it in another city , or even another country , when you are ready to return home .</s>

<s>at some cities , this pick-up and delivery service is without additional charge , and , if you are budget-wise , when you are planning your itinerary , you will take advantage of these free delivery and collection stations in major cities within the larger European countries .</s>

<s>international Touring Documents are usually provided with the car as are road maps and touring data .</s>

<s>a valid American driving license is accepted in all countries except Portugal , Spain , Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe .</s>

<s>if you plan to visit any of these countries , you can obtain your International Driving Permit before you leave at a nominal fee -- around $3.00 .</s>

<s>your insurance , too , with most agencies , is provided with the car , covering comprehensive fire , theft , liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies in different countries .</s>

<s>if you would feel happier with full collision insurance , there is a small additional charge , again varying from country to country and depending on the term of such insurance .</s>

<s>the average charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1.00 a day .</s>

<s>the charge is variable , however , and goes as low as $.50 a day in Ireland and as high as $2.00 a day in Greece .</s>

<s>rental fees are variable , too , throughout the countries of Europe .</s>

<s>there are as many rates as there are countries and models of cars available .</s>

<s>as in the United States , there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus a few cents per kilometer driven , and the per-day rate drops if the car is retained for a week .</s>

<s>it drops again after fifteen and/or twenty-one days .</s>

<s>it is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from $.80 to $.90 for the equivalent of a United States gallon and while you might prefer a familiar Ford , Chevrolet or even a Cadillac , which are available in some countries , it is probably wiser to choose the smaller European makes which average thirty , thirty-five and even forty miles to the gallon .</s>

<s>your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people travelling in your group .</s>

<s>with the exception of the sports cars , even the quite tiny sedans will seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage space for really economical transportation .</s>

<s>there is a large variety of models to choose from in most countries , however , including 6-passenger sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn't all that much greater than for the wee sedans .</s>

<s>the basic costs are generally pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you reserve your car , but some of them offer supplementary advantages .</s>

<s>there is the free intra-city rent it here , leave it there service , as an example , the free delivery and collection at the airport , dockside or your hotel , luggage racks , touring documents and information and other similar services .</s>

<s>a little investigation by telephone or reading the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits .</s>

<s>the investigation will be well worth your time .</s>

<s>all model cars are not available in all countries .</s>

<s>quite naturally , there is a greater availability of those models which are manufactured within a specific country .</s>

<s>if you would like to start your tour in Italy , where the rental fees are actually the lowest in Europe , Fiats in all sizes are available , as are Alfa Romeo Giulietta models .</s>

<s>if you wish to budget closely on transportation , saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries , one agency lists the small Fiat 500 at only $1.26 a day plus $.03 a kilometer and the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon , seating six , at just $1.10 a day and $.105 a kilometer .</s>

<s>if you will be using your car more than fifteen days , which isn't all unlikely , the daily rates drop quite sharply to $.86 a day for the Fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal $.30 a day for the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon .</s>

<s>with six in the group , the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily fee .</s>

<s>in the majority of countries , however , the rates range from $3.00 to $3.50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7.00 and $8.00 a day for the larger , luxury European models , with the rate per kilometer driven starting at $.03 and going up as high as $.12 .</s>

<s>the same model car might be available in six or eight countries , yet not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer driven .</s>

<s>the variations are not too great .</s>

<s>rates for American cars are somewhat higher , ranging from about $8.00 a day up to $14.00 a day for a Chevrolet Convertible , but the rate per kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger European models .</s>

<s>rates in Greece and Finland are fairly high , actually the highest in Europe , and , surprisingly enough , they are also quite high in Ireland .</s>

<s>if you are planning to tour Europe for longer than a month , it might be wise for you to lease a car .</s>

<s>the actual over-all cost , for the first month , will perhaps not be too much lower than the rental charges for the same period of time , but you will receive a new car .</s>

<s>you will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner , which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized dealers throughout Europe .</s>

<s>further , there is no mileage charge or mileage limitations when you lease a car , and you pay only the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since the car is registered and insured individually for your trip .</s>

<s>there is a fairly wide selection of models of English , German and French manufacture from which you can choose from the very small Austin 7 , Citroen 2 J , Volkswagens , Renaults to the 6-passenger Simca Beaulieu .</s>

<s>leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a car in Europe , but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory .</s>

<s>after the first month , rates are considerably less , averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger models .</s>

<s>there are reasons for some people not wanting to rent cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan .</s>

<s>for one thing , the driver usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road .</s>

<s>then , too , European drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on the road and some Americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed up with them .</s>

<s>still there is a way for those who want to see some of the back country of Europe by car .</s>

<s>the way is to rent a chauffeur-driven car .</s>

<s>it isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be .</s>

<s>your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7.00 to $12.00 a day , but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger Cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger Peugeot or Fiat 1800 .</s>

<s>the big spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven , being governed by the rate at which gasoline is consumed .</s>

<s>since most European cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than American cars , it naturally follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less , but the greater seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize this , provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger limousine .</s>

<s>the fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for the drive-yourself cars .</s>

<s>however , whether you arrange to have a European or American model , if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity in relation to the number of people in your party , your transportation expense will average very close to $10.00 per day per passenger .</s>

<s>this will include your helpful , English-speaking chauffeur and a drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day .</s>

<s>if you drive greater distances than that , you'll just be skimming the surface and will never discover the enchantment , fascination and beauty which lured you in the first place to explore the hinterlands .</s>

<s>of course , if you want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an Imperial or Cadillac limousine just for you and your bride , you'll have a memorable tour , but it won't be cheap , and it is not recommended unless you own a producing oil well or you've had a winner in the Irish Sweepstakes .</s>

<s>in American romance , almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called meeting cute -- that is , boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom .</s>

<s>just about the most enthralling real-life example of meeting cute is the Charles MacArthur-Helen Hayes saga : reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts , but he said simultaneously , I wish they were emeralds .</s>

<s>aside from the comico-romantico content here , a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other facts , especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on .</s>

<s>the way MacArthur said his line -- if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist -- would probably have gone like this : F primary stresses on emeralds and wish ;
note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl , one degree of oversoftness .</s>

<s>conclusions : the people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ) knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds , both monetary and sentimental .</s>

<s>and the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt , was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture .</s>

<s>in other words , like automation machines designed to work in tandem , they shared the same programming , a mutual understanding not only of English words , but of the four stresses , pitches , and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white .</s>

<s>at this point , unfortunately , romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture ;
but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happened if MacArthur , for some perverse , undaunted reason , had made the same remark to an Eskimo girl in Eskimo .</s>

<s>to her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber .</s>

<s>the point -- quite simply -- is this : words they might have had ;
but communication , no .</s>

<s>this basic principle , the first in a richly knotted bundle , was conveyed to me by Dr. Henry Lee Smith , Jr. , at the University of Buffalo , where he heads the world's first department of anthropology and linguistics .</s>

<s>a brisk , amusing man , apparently constructed on an ingenious system of spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind , Smith began his academic career teaching speech to Barnard girls -- a project considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about a young rat named Arthur , who never could make up his mind .</s>

<s>later , he became one of the central spirits of the Army Language Program and the language school of Washington's Foreign Service Institute .</s>

<s>it was there , in the course of trying to prepare new men for the culture shock they might encounter in remote overseas posts , that he first began to develop a system of charting the norms of human communication .</s>

<s>to the trained ear of the linguist , talk has always revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker -- such things as geographical origin and/or history , socio-economic identity , education .</s>

<s>it is only fairly recently , however , that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people .</s>

<s>this , for obvious reasons , makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview , so useful , in fact , that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy .</s>

<s>in the early 1950's , Smith , together with his distinguished colleague , George Trager ( so austerely academic he sometimes fights his own evident charm ) , and a third man with the engaging name of Birdwhistell ( Ray ) , agreed on some basic premises about the three-part process that makes communication : ( 1 ) words or language ( 2 ) paralanguage , a set of phenomena including laughing , weeping , voice breaks , and tone of voice , and ( 3 ) kinesics , the technical name for gestures , facial expressions , and body shifts -- nodding or shaking the head , talking with one's hands , et cetera .</s>

<s>Smith's first workout with stresses , pitches , and junctures was based on mother , which spells , in our culture , a good deal more than bread alone .</s>

<s>for example , if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person , there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother .</s>

<s>the usual U.S. norm would be : F middle pitches , slight pause ( juncture ) before mother , slight rise at the end .</s>

<s>the symbols of mother's status , here , are all usual for culture U.S.A. .</s>

<s>quite other feelings are evidenced by this style : F note the drop to pitch 1 ( the lowest ) on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence ;
this is a fade ending , and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech , expressing something less than conventional respect for mother .</s>

<s>even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie goes with : F in other words , the way the speaker relates to mother is clearly indicated .</s>

<s>and while the meaning of the words is not in this instance altered , the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is definitely impaired .</s>

<s>an accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp .</s>

<s>with this seven-word sentence -- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food -- he was telling things about himself and , in the last two examples , revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture .</s>

<s>the joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established , in point of fact , that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved , it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate to the rest of the world .</s>

<s>since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry , the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone proportions in new research and training .</s>

<s>some of the earliest recordings , made in the 1940's demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track , whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which -- if they were at all discernible in print -- were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts .</s>

<s>in a general way , psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt -- that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic , that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words .</s>

<s>at a minimum , recording -- usually on tape , which is now in wide professional use -- brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists .</s>

<s>newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level .</s>

<s>by adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews , they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist .</s>

<s>linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs from expected norms .</s>

<s>it flags such possible breakdowns of communication as rehearsed dialogue , the note of disapproval , ambivalence or ambiguity , annoyance , resentment , and the disinclination to speak at all -- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences .</s>

<s>interpretation , naturally , remains the role of the therapist , but orientation -- not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background , but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably beefed up by the linguist .</s>

<s>his esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties , making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient .</s>

<s>in one now-historic first interview , for example , the transcript ( reproduced from the book , the First Five Minutes ) goes like this : the therapist's level tone is bland and neutral -- he has , for example , avoided stressing you , which would imply disapproval ;
or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people .</s>

<s>the patient , on the other hand , is far from neutral ;
aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveals by the use of the triad , irritable , tense , depressed , a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ( i.e.</s>

<s>, she must have had at least a high-school education ) , and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before .</s>

<s>then she catapults into everything and everybody , putting particular violence on everybody , indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is , it is not congruent to the patient's general style of speech up to this point .</s>

<s>consequently , it is referred to the therapist for attention .</s>

<s>he may then very well conclude that everybody is probably not the true target of her resentment .</s>

<s>immediately thereafter , the patient fractures her rehearsed story , veering into an oversoft , breathy , sloppily articulated , I don't feel like talking right now .</s>

<s>within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that everybody truthfully refers to the woman's husband .</s>

<s>she says later , but still within the opening five minutes , I keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death .</s>

<s>the linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence ;
so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce .</s>

<s>by saying another emotional death , she reveals that there has been a previous one , although she has not described it in words .</s>

<s>this the therapist may pursue in later questioning .</s>

<s>the phrase , emotional death , interesting and , to a non-scientific mind , rather touching , suggests that this woman may have some flair for words , perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called creative .</s>

<s>since the psychiatric interview , like any other interview , depends on communication , it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience .</s>

<s>his own communication apparatus operated superbly , and Lillian Ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted , monumentally unmeshed mechanism of Dr. Blauberman .</s>

<s>interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques ;
almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again .</s>

<s>yet , in spite of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong with him ;
to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen .</s>

<s>naturally , the patient does not say , I hate my father , or Sibling rivalry is what bugs me .</s>

<s>what he does do is give himself away by communicating information over and above the words involved .</s>

<s>some of the classic indicators , as described by Drs.</s>

<s>Pittenger , Hockett , and Danehy in the First Five Minutes , are these : ambiguity of pronouns :
stammering or repetition of I , you , he , she , et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty .</s>

<s>on the other hand significant facts may be concealed -- she may mean I or everybody , as it did with the tense and irritable woman mentioned before , may refer to a specific person .</s>

<s>the word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used ;
therapist and/or linguist must always consider the alternatives .</s>

<s>when someone says , for example , they took x-rays to see that there was nothing wrong with me , it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made .</s>

<s>( this patient , in actuality , was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty .
)</s>

<s>amateur linguists note here that Pursewarden , in Durrell's Alexandria Quartet , stammered when he spoke of his wife , which is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship .</s>

<s>she was just another freighter from the States , and she seemed as commonplace as her name .</s>

<s>she was the John Harvey , one of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans , bombs , and bullets to the U.S. Fifteenth Air Force , to Field Marshal Montgomery's Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the boot of Italy in that early December of 1943 .</s>

<s>the John Harvey arrived in Bari , a port on the Adriatic , on November 28th , making for Porto Nuovo , which , as the name indicates , was the ancient city's new and modern harbor .</s>

<s>hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole .</s>

<s>if anyone thought of the John Harvey , it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the John Harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried .</s>

<s>which was poison gas .</s>

<s>it had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt before the John Harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the Italian warfront .</s>

<s>for in a world as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud , poison gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons .</s>

<s>throughout the early years of World War 2 , reports persisted that the Axis powers had used gas -- Germany in Russia , Japan in China again .</s>

<s>they were always denied .</s>

<s>influential people in America were warning the Pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the Germans in future campaigns .</s>

<s>some extremists went so far as to urge our using it first .</s>

<s>to silence extremists , to warn the Axis , President Roosevelt issued this statement for the Allies in August : from time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the Axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare .</s>

<s>I have been loath to believe that any nation , even our present enemies , could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons .</s>

<s>however , evidence that the Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources .</s>

<s>use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind .</s>

<s>this country has not used them , and I hope that we never will be compelled to use them .</s>

<s>I state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies .</s>

<s>the following month the invasion of Italy was begun , and Roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern Italy .</s>

<s>Bari was chosen as a depot , not only for its seeming safety , but because of its proximity to airfields .</s>

<s>any retaliatory gas attack would be airborne .</s>

<s>it would be made in three waves -- the first to lay down a smokescreen , the second to drop the gas bombs , the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below .</s>

<s>so the vile cargo went into the hole of the John Harvey .</s>

<s>a detachment of six men from the 701st Chemical Maintenance Company under First Lt. Howard D. Beckstrom went aboard , followed by Lt. Thomas H. Richardson , the Cargo Security Officer .</s>

<s>secrecy was paramount .</s>

<s>only a few other people -- very important people -- knew of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks .</s>

<s>no one else must know .</s>

<s>thus , in the immemorial way -- in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not -- was the stage set for tragedy at Bari .</s>

<s>it was the night of December 2 , 1943 , and it was growing dark in Bari .</s>

<s>it was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the German J plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit .</s>

<s>Capt.</s>

<s>A.</s>

<s>B. Jenks of the Office of Harbor Defense was very worried .</s>

<s>he knew that German long-range bombers had been returning to the attack in Italy .</s>

<s>on November 24th , they had made a raid on La Maddalena .</s>

<s>two days later , some 30 of them had struck at a convoy off Bougie , sinking a troopship -- and it had been that very night that the J had made its first appearance .</s>

<s>after it had reappeared the next two nights , Jenks went to higher headquarters and said : for three days now a German reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures .</s>

<s>they're just waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump this place into the Adriatic .</s>

<s>but the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist .</s>

<s>even though it was known that the Luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by the young and energetic General Peltz , the commander who would conduct the Little Blitz on London in 1944 , a major raid on Bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered seriously .</s>

<s>true , there had been raids on Naples -- but Naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast .</s>

<s>no , Bari was out of range .</s>

<s>more than that , Allied air had complete superiority in the Eighth Army's sector .</s>

<s>so Captain Jenks returned to his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put in five more appearances , and to feel the certainty of this dread rising within him .</s>

<s>for Jenks knew that Bari's defenses were made of paper .</s>

<s>the Royal Air Force had but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available .</s>

<s>there were no R.A.F.</s>

<s>fighter squadrons on Bari airfield .</s>

<s>the radar station with the best location was still not serviceable .</s>

<s>telephone communication was bad .</s>

<s>and everywhere in evidence among the few remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster -- multiple command .</s>

<s>it had been made shockingly evident that very morning to Ensign Kay K. Vesole , in charge of the armed guard aboard the John Bascom .</s>

<s>a British officer had come aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped .</s>

<s>then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a radar-controlled shore gun firing white tracers .</s>

<s>this harbor is a bomber's paradise , the Britisher had said with frank grimness .</s>

<s>it's up to you to protect yourselves .</s>

<s>we can't expect any help from the fighters at Foggia , either .</s>

<s>they're all being used on offensive missions .</s>

<s>Vesole had been stunned .</s>

<s>not fire until the bombs came down ]
he thought of the tons and tons of flammable fluid beneath his feet and shook his head .</s>

<s>like hell ]
like hell he'd wait -- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out ?</s>

<s>what would his guns guide on then -- the North Star ?</s>

<s>Ensign Vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs , and when night began to fall , he put Seaman 2/c Donald L. Norton and Seaman 1/c William A. Rochford on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette .</s>

<s>below decks , Seaman 1/c Stanley Bishop had begun to write a letter home .</s>

<s>above decks on the John Harvey , Lieutenant Richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy .</s>

<s>there were lights glinting in the city , too , even though it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible .</s>

<s>Bari was asking for it , he thought .</s>

<s>for five days now , they had been in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold .</s>

<s>Richardson wondered when it would be unloaded .</s>

<s>he hoped they would put in somewhere way , way down in the earth .</s>

<s>the burden of his secret was pressing down on him , as it was on Lieutenant Beckstrom and his six enlisted men .</s>

<s>Lieutenant Richardson could envy the officers and men of the John Harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs .</s>

<s>they seemed happy at the delay in unloading , glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such as Bari .</s>

<s>nine of them had gone down the gangplank already .</s>

<s>Deck Cadet James L. Cahill and Seaman Walter Brooks had been the first to leave .</s>

<s>Richardson had returned their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer's stock in trade .</s>

<s>the other half of the crew , plus Beckstrom and his men , had remained aboard .</s>

<s>Richardson glanced to sea and started slightly .</s>

<s>damned if that wasn't a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor -- Porto Vecchio .</s>

<s>the night was so clear that Richardson had no difficulty making out the silhouette .</s>

<s>then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver , and he glanced upward .</s>

<s>his eyes boggled .</s>

<s>it was a clear night and it was raining ]
Capt.</s>

<s>Michael A. Musmanno , Military governor of the Sorrentine Peninsula , had also seen and felt the rain .</s>

<s>but he had mistaken it for bugs .</s>

<s>Captain Musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant name Unsinkable had just left Porto Vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed olive oil for the Sorrentine's civilian population .</s>

<s>Musmanno was on deck .</s>

<s>at exactly 7:30 , he felt a fluttering object brush his face .</s>

<s>he snatched at it savagely .</s>

<s>he turned the beam of his flashlight on it .</s>

<s>he laughed .</s>

<s>it was the silver foil from the chocolate bar he had been eating .</s>

<s>he frowned .</s>

<s>but how could -- ?</s>

<s>another , longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth .</s>

<s>it was two feet long .</s>

<s>it was not candy wrapping .</s>

<s>it was window -- the tinsel paper dropped by bombers to jam radar sets , to fill the scope with hundreds of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers .</s>

<s>fermate ]
Musmanno bellowed to his Italian crewmen .</s>

<s>stop ]
stop the engines ]
Unsinkable slowed and stopped , hundreds of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black , the air raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek , the anti-aircraft guns coughed and chattered -- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor at Bari .</s>

<s>they had come from airports in the Balkans , these hundred-odd Junkers 88's .</s>

<s>they had winged over the Adriatic , they had taken Bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her , attacking with deadly skill .</s>

<s>they had ruined the radar warning system with their window , they had made themselves invisible above their flares .</s>

<s>and they also had the lights of the city , the port wall lanterns , and a shore crane's spotlight to guide on .</s>

<s>after the first two were blacked out , the third light was abandoned by a terrified Italian crew , who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring homing beacon until British J shot it out .</s>

<s>in that interval , the German bombers made a hell of Bari harbor .</s>

<s>merchant ships illuminated in the light of the flares , made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud , were impossible to miss .</s>

<s>the little Unsinkable sank almost immediately .</s>

<s>Captain Musmanno roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for a raft .</s>

<s>they got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went under .</s>

<s>John Bascom went down early , too .</s>

<s>Ensign Vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly , but they had no targets .</s>

<s>most of the Junkers were above the blinding light of the flares , and the radar-controlled shore gun had been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs .</s>

<s>Vesole rushed from gun to gun , attempting to direct fire .</s>

<s>he was wounded , but fought on .</s>

<s>Norton and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors .</s>

<s>Bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20-mm gun , pumping out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed into Holds One , Three and Five .</s>

<s>now the Bascom was mortally wounded .</s>

<s>luckily , she was not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt .</s>

<s>the order to abandon ship was given , but cries of pain could be heard from the wounded below decks .</s>

<s>there is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement .</s>

<s>you explain , I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before .</s>

<s>I can't tell when , but I'm positive I witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past ]
this experience will have happened to many of you .</s>

<s>Emerson , in his lecture , refers to the startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when .</s>

<s>most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences .</s>

<s>in this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually .</s>

<s>when a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja vue , except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar .</s>

<s>occasionally there are examples of pre-vision which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude .</s>

<s>one day Maeterlinck , coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream , detailed the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified .</s>

<s>Rudyard Kipling's scorn for the jargon of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered how , or why , had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film ?</s>

<s>the famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something About Myself .</s>

<s>one day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left , his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone , clasping him by the arm , whispered , I want a word with you , please .</s>

<s>at that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier .</s>

<s>Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts .</s>

<s>however , readers who accept Freud's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams , Chapter 1 :
as a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case , and what is more , every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams .</s>

<s>dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision .</s>

<s>the basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .</s>

<s>I recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town .</s>

<s>I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence , so complete in detail , from the hodge-podge of news pictures I have seen .</s>

<s>and when psychology explains glibly , but the subconscious mind is able to produce it it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind .</s>

<s>skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence .</s>

<s>the question becomes , what is a dream ?</s>

<s>is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie ?</s>

<s>every dream , and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available .</s>

<s>in most cases we recognize certain words , persons , animals or objects .</s>

<s>but these are dreamed in original action , in some particular continuity which we don't remember having seen in real life .</s>

<s>for instance , the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and , with photographic realism , sees Smith driving the car ;
whereas , it is a matter of fact that Smith cannot drive a car .</s>

<s>there is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams .</s>

<s>the entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support .</s>

<s>a mental image subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought , or consciously in light sleep , is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream , but within the depths of the fourth dimension .</s>

<s>dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja vue , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem .</s>

<s>as in the theory of perception , established in psycho-physiology , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain .</s>

<s>but then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain .</s>

<s>the opening paragraph of the chapter titled the Theory Of Representative Perception , in the book Philosophies Of Science by Albert G. Ramsperger says , passed on to the brain , and there , by some unexplained process , it causes the mind to have a perception .</s>

<s>but why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ?</s>

<s>as retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves , between the inner brain and the eyes , carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers -- rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location .</s>

<s>hereby , the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen , not the retinal image , the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers , motor tensions , associated word symbols , and consciousness .</s>

<s>modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy .</s>

<s>we know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound waves , ultra-violet rays , etc.</s>

<s>, that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite .</s>

<s>so we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states of matter , successive one after another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies .</s>

<s>this theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness .</s>

<s>space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions .</s>

<s>if the fourth dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical , through what medium does it extend ?</s>

<s>it is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever-existent past-fantasy future .</s>

<s>three seconds flat is the usual time , and the space is crossed by moderate mileage , while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events .</s>

<s>the body , senses and brain , in common with all matter , have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies .</s>

<s>the senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency , whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible , inaudible and intactible to them .</s>

<s>consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions .</s>

<s>when consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world , it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future , in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep .</s>

<s>if the photographically realistic continuity of dreams , however bizarre their combinations , denies that it is purely a composition of the brain , it must be compounded from views of diverse realities , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life .</s>

<s>Dr. H. V. Hilprecht , Professor of Assyrian at the University of Pennsylvania , dreamed that a Babylonian priest , associated with the king Kurigalzu , ( 1300 B.C. )</s>

<s>escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel , gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic , and corrected an error in its identification .</s>

<s>as a matter of fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by Dr. Hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day .</s>

<s>some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription , together with other new evidence , fully corroborated the ancient priest's information .</s>

<s>Dr. Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream .</s>

<s>he was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite , and imagined it must have been German or English .</s>

<s>we may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by Dr. Hilprecht's subconscious reasoning .</s>

<s>but , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ?</s>

<s>which theory is more fantastic : 1 .</s>

<s>that the perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions in the professor's brain , or 2 .</s>

<s>that the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal , gradient frequencies , across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met ?</s>

<s>the degree of circumstance , the ratio of memory to forgetfulness , determines whether a dream will be a recognized , fulfilled prevision , or the vaguely effective source of the weird deja vue feeling .</s>

<s>no doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper's mind .</s>

<s>probably less than one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration before we wake .</s>

<s>when we arrive at the events concerned in the vanished majority , they , of course , cannot impress us as anything familiar .</s>

<s>nevertheless , there are notably frequent instances of deja vue , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before , a feeling which , though vague , withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists .</s>

<s>if deja vue is an illusion , then peculiarly , it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people .</s>

<s>Chauncey Depew , one-time runner-up for the Republican Presidential nomination , was attending a convention at Saratoga , where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel Theodore Roosevelt for Governor of New York when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met .</s>

<s>after the preliminary business affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt .</s>

<s>if Depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past , he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue .</s>

<s>but the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene .</s>

<s>he remembered exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had .</s>

<s>one week before the convention , Depew was seated on the porch of a country home on the Hudson , gazing at the opposite shore .</s>

<s>in this one sentence , he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school .</s>

<s>because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients , the food does taste good .</s>

<s>when served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension , a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments , the athletic programs and the most important phase , the educational opportunities .</s>

<s>situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country , the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands .</s>

<s>these contemporary structures , beautifully adapted to a school in the country , are home to 60 children , ages eight to fourteen , grades four through eight .</s>

<s>from fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-September to June .</s>

<s>the Director , Walter E. Clark , believes that a school with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare .</s>

<s>to him this means caring for the whole child , providing basic nutrition , and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind .</s>

<s>improved farming methods
the concept of good nutrition really began with the garden .</s>

<s>the school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school .</s>

<s>in a climate hostile to agriculture , Mr. Clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques .</s>

<s>where a growing season may , with luck , allow 60 days without frost , and where the soil is poor , sandy , quick-drying and subject to erosion , many farmers fail .</s>

<s>throughout the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat .</s>

<s>Mr. Clark found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing , use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides , plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring , did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil .</s>

<s>to give up these notions required a revolution in thought , Mr. Clark said in reminiscing about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began reading Organic Gardening And Modern Nutrition in a search for help with his problems .</s>

<s>Louis Bromfield's writings excited me as a conservationist .</s>

<s>by 1952 he was convinced he would no longer spray .</s>

<s>he locked his equipment in a cabinet where it still remains .</s>

<s>after reading Plowman's Folly by Edward H. Faulkner , he stopped plowing .</s>

<s>the basis for compost materials already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program , poultry for eggs , pigs to eat garbage , a beef herd and wastes of all kinds .</s>

<s>separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg shells .</s>

<s>all these materials and supplementary manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year .</s>

<s>it was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader .</s>

<s>years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity .</s>

<s>soon after the method changed , visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his soil to keep it looking moist , when in reality , it was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this .</s>

<s>to demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens as it is today , Mr. Clark stooped to scoop up a handful of rich dark earth .</s>

<s>sniffing its sweet smell and letting it fall to show its good crumbly consistency , he pointed to the nearby driveway and said , this soil used to be like that hard packed road over there .</s>

<s>people and soils respond slowly , says Walter Clark , but the time has now come when the gardens produce delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program .</s>

<s>no chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are used .</s>

<s>the garden supplies enough carrots , turnips , rutabagas , potatoes , beets , cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the root cellar .</s>

<s>the carrots sometimes don't make it through the winter ;
the cabbage and squash keep until March or April .</s>

<s>there is never enough corn , peas or strawberries .</s>

<s>Mr. Clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields , but he has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in the future .</s>

<s>a new project planned is the use of Bio-Dynamic Starter .</s>

<s>new ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil treatment .</s>

<s>after the soil , the kitchen , says Mr. Clark .</s>

<s>the first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread .</s>

<s>adults take a long time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push .</s>

<s>at first the kitchen help was tolerant , but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves .</s>

<s>you can't make French toast with whole-wheat bread , was an early complaint .</s>

<s>of course they learned in time that they not only could use whole-wheat bread , but the children liked it better .</s>

<s>homemade bread
Mrs. Clark , as house manager , planned the menus and cared for the ordering .</s>

<s>then Miss Lillian Colman came from Vermont to be kitchen manager .</s>

<s>today whole grains are freshly ground every day and baked into bread .</s>

<s>Mr. Clark's studies taught him that the only way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the flour .</s>

<s>once the grains are ground , vitamin J begins to deteriorate immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within one week .</s>

<s>a mill stands in a room off the kitchen .</s>

<s>surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state .</s>

<s>Miss Colman pours measures of whole wheat , oats , and soy beans and turns on the motor .</s>

<s>she goes on about her work and listens for the completion of the grinding .</s>

<s>the bread baked from this mixture is light in color and fragrant in aroma .</s>

<s>it is well liked by the children and faculty .</s>

<s>there is one problem with the bread .</s>

<s>Lillian's bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here that it is hard not to eat too much , said the secretary ruefully eyeing her extra pounds .</s>

<s>hot , freshly-ground cereal
the school has not used cold prepared cereals for years , though at one time that was all they ever served .</s>

<s>when the chance came , they first eliminated cold cereal once a week , then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground cereal every day .</s>

<s>they serve cracked wheat , oats or cornmeal .</s>

<s>occasionally , the children find steamed , whole-wheat grains for cereal which they call buckshot .</s>

<s>at the beginning of the school year , the new students don't eat the cereal right away , but within a short time they are eating it voraciously .</s>

<s>when they leave for vacations they miss the hot cereal .</s>

<s>the school has received letters from parents asking , what happened to Johnny ?</s>

<s>he never used to like any hot cereal , now that's the only kind he wants .</s>

<s>where can we get this cereal he likes so much ?</s>

<s>body-building foods
salads are served at least once a day .</s>

<s>vegetables are served liberally .</s>

<s>most come from the root cellar or from the freezer .</s>

<s>home-made sauerkraut is served once a week .</s>

<s>sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads and dishes such as chop suey .</s>

<s>sometimes sprouted wheat is added to bread and causes the children to remark , Lillian , did you put nuts in the bread today ?</s>

<s>milk appears twice a day .</s>

<s>the school raises enough poultry , pigs , and beef cattle for most of their needs .</s>

<s>lots of cheese made from June grass milk is served .</s>

<s>hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility .</s>

<s>organ meats such as beef and chicken liver , tongue and heart are planned once a week .</s>

<s>also , salt water fish is on the table once a week .</s>

<s>for deserts , puddings and pies are each served once a week .</s>

<s>most other desserts are fruit in some form , fresh fruits once daily at least , sometimes at snack time .</s>

<s>dried fruits are purchased from sources where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed .</s>

<s>apples come from a farm in Vermont where they are not sprayed .</s>

<s>oranges and grapefruit are shipped from Florida weekly from an organic farm .</s>

<s>finding sources for these high quality foods is a problem .</s>

<s>sometimes the solution comes in unexpected ways .</s>

<s>following a talk by Mr. Clark at the New York State Natural Food Associates Convention , a man from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school from Vermont .</s>

<s>wheat-germ , brewer's yeast and ground kelp are used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce , meat loaves .</s>

<s>Miss Colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available at the tables .</s>

<s>raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table for the children to help themselves .</s>

<s>very few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged .</s>

<s>drinking with meals is also discouraged ;
pitchers of water merely appear on the tables .</s>

<s>nothing is peeled .</s>

<s>the source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues .</s>

<s>the cooking conserves a maximum of the vitamin J content of vegetables by methods which use very little water and cook in the shortest time possible .</s>

<s>wholesome snacks , no candy
since Mr. Clark believes firmly that the chewing of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth , raw vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons .</s>

<s>to solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot , a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains .</s>

<s>on their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains , the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail .</s>

<s>they learn to like these so well that it isn't surprising to hear that one boy tried the oats he was feeding his horse at chore time .</s>

<s>they tasted good to him , so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk and honey .</s>

<s>maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds .</s>

<s>this and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking .</s>

<s>candy is not allowed .</s>

<s>parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting of fruit and nuts , but no candy .</s>

<s>nourishing meals Mr. Clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit , hot cereal , milk , honey , whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs .</s>

<s>the heavy meal comes in the middle of the day .</s>

<s>soup is often the important dish at supper .</s>

<s>homemade of meat , bones and vegetables , it is rich in dissolved minerals and vitamins .</s>

<s>the school finds that the children are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high in quality .</s>

<s>the cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day .</s>

<s>outdoor exercises
even before he saw the necessity of growing better food and planning good nutrition , Mr. Clark felt the school had a good health program .</s>

<s>rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule .</s>

<s>a vigorous program existed in skiing , skating sports and overnight hiking .</s>

<s>healthier children
since the change to better nutrition , he feels he can report on improvements in health , though he considers the following statements observations and not scientific proof .</s>

<s>visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use on the children's hair to bring out the sheen .</s>

<s>the ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment .</s>

<s>buffeted by swirling winds , the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond Northfield Gulf .</s>

<s>wires whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings , but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit .</s>

<s>he peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again below .</s>

<s>good old iron compass ]
he thought .</s>

<s>a plume of smoke rose from a Central Vermont locomotive which idled behind a string of gravel cars , and little figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured roadbed to rights .</s>

<s>the girders of a shattered Dog River bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream .</s>

<s>Vermont's main railroad line was prostrate .</s>

<s>and in the dark days after the Great Flood of 1927 -- the worst natural disaster in the state's history -- the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the United States mails .</s>

<s>rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of Friday , November 4 , 1927 , when officials of the Post Office Department's Railway Mail Service realized that their distribution system for Vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight .</s>

<s>clerks and postmasters shoveled muck out of their offices -- those who still had offices -- and wondered how to move the mail .</s>

<s>the state's railroad system counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way : it would obviously remain out of commission for weeks .</s>

<s>and once medicine , food , clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood's victims , communications and the mail were the next top problems .</s>

<s>from Burlington , outgoing mail could be ferried across Lake Champlain to the railroad at Port Kent , N. Y. .</s>

<s>but what came in was piling up .</s>

<s>the nearest undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord , N. H. .</s>

<s>when Governor Al Smith offered New York National Guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state , it seemed a likely temporary solution , easing Burlington's bottleneck and that at Montpelier too .</s>

<s>the question was where to land ?</s>

<s>there was no such thing as an airport in Vermont .</s>

<s>Burlington aviator John J. Burns suggested the parade ground southwest of Fort Ethan Allen , and soon a dozen hastily-summoned National Guard pilots were bringing their wide-winged Jenny and DeHaviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen sod of the military base .</s>

<s>the only available field that could be used near flood-ravaged Montpelier was on the Towne farm off upper Main Street , a narrow hillside where takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions .</s>

<s>over in Barre the streets had been deep in swirling water , and bridges were crumpled and gone .</s>

<s>anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast by plane , Granite City citizens formed an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd Infantry , Vermont National Guard , laid out runways on Wilson flat , high on Millstone Hill .</s>

<s>the Barre Aviation Field was set to receive its first aircraft the Sunday following the flood .</s>

<s>though the makeshift airports were ready , the York State Guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of mail schedule .</s>

<s>they had courage but their meager training consisted of weekend hops in good weather , in and out of established airports , and the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines of their World War 1 planes .</s>

<s>it seemed like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering the post office department to contract for the transport of first class mail by air .</s>

<s>they had to act fast , for letters were clogging the terminals .</s>

<s>down in Concord , New Hampshire , was a flier in the right place at the right time : Robert S. Fogg , a native New Englander , had been a World War 1 flying instructor , barnstormer , and one of the original planners of the Concord Airport .</s>

<s>tall , wiry , dark-haired Bob Fogg had already racked up one historical first in air mail history .</s>

<s>piloting a Curtiss Navy J flying boat off Lake Winnipesaukee in 1925 , he had inaugurated the original Rural Delivery air service in America .</s>

<s>during the excitement following Lindbergh's flight to Paris earlier in 1927 , dare devil aviators overnight became legendary heroes .</s>

<s>in Concord , Bob Fogg was the most prominent New Hampshire boy with wings .</s>

<s>public-spirited backers staked him to a brand-new airplane , aimed at putting their city and state on the flying map .</s>

<s>the ship was a Waco biplane , one of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled , 225/hp Wright radial engine known as the Whirlwind .</s>

<s>a trim green and silver-painted craft only 22-1/2 feet long , the Waco was entered to compete in the On-to-Spokane Air Derby of 1927 .</s>

<s>as a matter of fact , Fogg and his plane didn't get beyond Pennsylvania in the race -- an engine oil leak forced him down -- but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his wry-faced backers .</s>

<s>so with all this experience , Bob Fogg was a natural choice to receive the first Emergency Air Mail Star Route contract .</s>

<s>his work began just six days after the flood .</s>

<s>by airline from Concord to Burlington is a distance of about 150 miles , counting a slight deviation for the stop at either Barre or Montpelier .</s>

<s>the first few days Bob Fogg set his plane down on Towne field back of the State House when the wind was right , and used Wilson flat above Barre when it wasn't .</s>

<s>between the unsafe Towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to Wilson flat , arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory .</s>

<s>each time in , the unhappy pilot , pushing his luck , begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing place , preferably on the flat-topped hills across the Winooski River .</s>

<s>but Fogg , they countered , we can't get over there .</s>

<s>and besides you seem to make it all right here .</s>

<s>it took a tragedy to bring things to a head .</s>

<s>after a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs , Fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage of an Army plane strewn across snow-covered Towne field .</s>

<s>sent to Montpelier by Secretary Herbert Hoover , Red Cross Aide Reuben Sleight had been killed , and his pilot , Lt. Franklin Wolfe , badly injured .</s>

<s>with the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply flown into the hillside .</s>

<s>faced with this situation , Postmaster Charles F. McKenna of Montpelier went with Fogg on a Burlington trip , and together they scouted the terrain on the heights of Berlin .</s>

<s>a long flat known as the St. John field seemed to answer their purpose , and since the Winooski bridges were at last passable , they decided to use it .</s>

<s>with a wary eye on the farmer's bull , Fred Somers of Montpelier and Mr. St. John marked the field with a red table cloth .</s>

<s>as a wind direction indicator , they tied a cotton rag to a sapling .</s>

<s>with these aids , and a pair of skiis substituting for wheels on the Waco , Bob Fogg made the first landing on what is now part of the Barre-Montpelier Airport on November 21 , 1927 .</s>

<s>each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail pouches .</s>

<s>during the second week of operations , Fogg received a telegram from the Post Office Department , asking him to put on two airplanes and make two flights daily , plus one Sunday trip .</s>

<s>since Fogg's was a one-man , one-plane flying service , this meant that he would have to do both trips , flying alone 600 miles a day , under sub-freezing temperature conditions .</s>

<s>over the weeks , America's first Star Route Air Mail settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation .</s>

<s>each morning at five Fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace register of his home .</s>

<s>always troubled by poor circulation in his feet , he experimented with various combinations of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer's boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them .</s>

<s>a sheep-lined leather flying suit , plus helmet , goggles and mittens completed his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit .</s>

<s>the airman's stock answer to weren't you cold ?</s>

<s>became yes , the first half hour is tough , but by then I'm so numb I don't notice it ]
as daylight began to show through the frosty windows , Fogg would place a call to William A. Shaw at the U. S. Weather Station at Northfield , Vermont , for temperature and wind-velocity readings .</s>

<s>Shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station .</s>

<s>ceilings were judged by comparison with known mountain heights and cloud positions .</s>

<s>later on in the day Fogg could get a better weather picture from the Burlington Weather Bureau supervised by Frank E. Hartwell .</s>

<s>out at the airport each morning , Fogg's skilled mechanic Caleb Marston would have the Waco warmed up and running in the drafty hangar .</s>

<s>( he'd get the engine oil flowing with an electric heater under a big canvas cover .
)</s>

<s>wishing to show that aviation was dependable and here to stay , Bob Fogg always made a point of taking off each morning on the dot of seven , disregarding rain , snow and sleet in true postal tradition .</s>

<s>Concord learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the Whirlwind's exhaust overhead .</s>

<s>sometimes the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog , but 85% of his trips were completed .</s>

<s>plane radios were not yet available , and once in the air , Fogg flew his ship by compass , a good memory for landmarks as seen from above , and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick computation .</s>

<s>often , threading through the overcast , he was forced to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling , skimming above the Winooski or the White River along the line of the broken railroad .</s>

<s>when driving rain or mist socked in one valley , Fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one , ranging from the Ottauquechee up to Danville in search of safe passage through the mountain passes .</s>

<s>the dependable Wright engine was never stopped on these trips .</s>

<s>it ticked over smoothly , idling while Fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from Burlington at Fort Ethan Allen , and one from Montpelier and Barre at the St. John field .</s>

<s>sometimes , on a return trip , the aviator would go upstairs high over the clouds .</s>

<s>there he'd take a compass reading , figure his air speed , and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he'd be over the broad meadows of the Merrimack Valley where it would be safe to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him .</s>

<s>Bob Fogg didn't have today's advantages of Instrument Flight and Ground Control Approach systems .</s>

<s>at the end of the calculated time he'd nose the Waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable .</s>

<s>usually back in Concord by noon , there was just time to get partially thawed out , refuel , and grab a bit of Mrs. Fogg's hot broth before starting the second trip .</s>

<s>day after day Fogg shuttled back and forth on his one-man air mail route , until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country .</s>

<s>the flyer had his share of near-misses .</s>

<s>at Fort Ethan Allen the ever-present wind off Lake Champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated .</s>

<s>once the soldiers from the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while Fogg revved the engine and got the tail up .</s>

<s>at a nod of his head they let go , turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream .</s>

<s>tracks in the snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet .</s>

<s>one afternoon during a cold , powdery snowstorm , Fogg took off for Concord from the St. John field .</s>

<s>are you retiring now ?</s>

<s>if so , are you saying , where did the last few years go ?</s>

<s>how did I get to be sixty-five so fast ?</s>

<s>what do I do now ?</s>

<s>do you yearn to make cakes and pies , or special cookies and candies ?</s>

<s>there is always an open market for this sort of delicacy , in spite of low calorie diets , cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets to the contrary .</s>

an important criterion of maturity is creativity .</s>

<s>the mature person is creative .</s>

<s>what does it mean to be creative , a term we hear with increasing frequency these days ?</s>

<s>when we turn to Noah Webster we find him helpful as usual .</s>

<s>to be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power .</s>

<s>we are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed .</s>

<s>thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake , building a chicken coop , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a League of Nations or , developing a mature character .</s>

<s>all living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity , if it is only to reproduce a form like their own .</s>

<s>while man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process , he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability .</s>

<s>an animal , bird or insect creates either a burrow , or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie .</s>

<s>man's great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination .</s>

<s>this gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories , ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms .</s>

<s>it has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world .</s>

<s>in our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a Jules Verne come into actuality .</s>

<s>the vision of a Lord Tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over London in the air blitzes of 1941 .</s>

<s>in fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more .</s>

<s>it is in this one aspect , at least , that man seems to be made in the image of his Creator .</s>

<s>not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms , but even more importantly , he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself .</s>

<s>we recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes , acrobats , dancers , musicians and artists , developing many potentialities .</s>

<s>we know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles .</s>

<s>by this same combination of the will and the imagination , each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be .</s>

<s>we must realize with Prof. Charles Morris in his The Open Self that man is the being that can continually remake himself , the artisan that is himself the material for his own creation .</s>

<s>so far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created .</s>

<s>is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy .</s>

<s>is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our own maturing process ?</s>

<s>Sir Julian Huxley in his book Uniqueness Of Man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection , so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his procreativity .</s>

<s>some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote , Victorian past ;
that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation .</s>

<s>perhaps -- but extensive discussions with contemporary practitioners , family doctors and gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance .</s>

<s>joking and talking may be freer and easier , but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women .</s>

<s>various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both .</s>

<s>privacy must be highly assured both in time and place .</s>

<s>that is , locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location , but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment .</s>

<s>if the wedding party lasted late , and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before resuming the trip or making an early start , the husband may forestall tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying in each other's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours .</s>

<s>the consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time ( day or night ) for that purpose .</s>

<s>first intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen .</s>

<s>one thing should be clear to both husband and wife -- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act .</s>

<s>ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety , misunderstanding and suspicion .</s>

<s>the hymen is , in essence , a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations .</s>

<s>( hymen , in fact , is the Greek word for membrane .
)</s>

<s>often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse .</s>

<s>as might be expected , girls in this situation bleed very little and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity .</s>

<s>it is also important to realize that many girls are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one ;
so that the absence of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations .</s>

<s>but there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations of the folk-lore beliefs .</s>

<s>some hymens are so strongly developed that they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood .</s>

<s>more rarely , the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration .</s>

<s>extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations to be consummated .</s>

<s>these cases , for all their rarity , are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to newly-weds .</s>

<s>in recent times , when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly , the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention .</s>

<s>obviously , the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation .</s>

<s>is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride ?</s>

<s>gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage .</s>

<s>if he foresaw any problem because of the quality of the hymen , it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or , preferably , to dilate it .</s>

<s>as a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina .</s>

<s>this recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act .</s>

<s>the vagina is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation .</s>

<s>this is obvious when it is remembered that , during childbirth , the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby .</s>

<s>the intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control .</s>

<s>but an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman .</s>

<s>that is , when first penetration takes place , the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain .</s>

<s>the advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological .</s>

<s>since it is a purely professional situation , none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved .</s>

<s>by using instruments of gradually increasing size , the vagina is gently , and with minimum pain at each stage , taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape .</s>

<s>in this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl .</s>

<s>she learns how to relax them to accept -- instead of contracting them to repel -- the entering object .</s>

<s>apart from the standard problem of controlling the vaginal muscles , other serious barriers may exist that need special gynecological treatment .</s>

<s>it is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation .</s>

<s>when no medical problems exist , the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves .</s>

<s>special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value .</s>

<s>folk-lore , superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints .</s>

<s>the importance of loving tenderness is obvious .</s>

<s>the long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels .</s>

<s>under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration .</s>

<s>extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin .</s>

<s>but during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall ( the bottom of the vagina in the same position ) without any pain ;
and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times .</s>

<s>these regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse .</s>

<s>the husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind .</s>

<s>they may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina ;
at least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making .</s>

<s>in fact , the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon .</s>

<s>locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration .</s>

<s>the false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all .</s>

<s>such talk is seriously in error .</s>

<s>ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride , both physically and psychologically .</s>

<s>the insistent , forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen .</s>

<s>the pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her , unconsciously , to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it .</s>

<s>serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in the honeymoon situation .</s>

<s>the necessity for keeping alert to his bride's hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous desire .</s>

<s>the emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax .</s>

<s>this is a very common experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife .</s>

<s>or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period .</s>

<s>the signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take advantage of them .</s>

<s>the best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again .</s>

<s>this may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered .</s>

<s>he can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost .</s>

<s>now while he uses talk , caresses or requires caresses from her , his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire .</s>

<s>a final word .</s>

<s>the accumulated information on this point shows that first intercourse , even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty , is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman .</s>

<s>too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment .</s>

<s>only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse .</s>

<s>both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax , and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid .</s>

<s>if the early approaches are wise , understanding and patient , the satisfactions of marital fulfillment will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older .</s>

<s>writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures , titled The Nude : A Study In Ideal Form , Kenneth Clark declares : the human body , as a nucleus , is rich in associations .</s>

<s>it is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves .</s>

<s>perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions , attitudes , and emotions precipitated by the nude form .</s>

<s>the wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated in the Kinsey studies in human sexuality .</s>

<s>differences were related to social , economic , and educational backgrounds .</s>

<s>whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity , those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations .</s>

<s>such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had never seen her entirely naked , while another woman , boasting an equal number of years of married life , is proud of having shared the nudist way of life -- the really free , natural nude life -- for most of that period .</s>

<s>attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions .</s>

<s>the indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human form as lewd and pornographic , a threat and danger to all the young , or good , or religious , or moral persons .</s>

<s>the equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the natural , honest , free expression of man's spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration .</s>

<s>one is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected .</s>

<s>I still recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the clean , healthful , free way of natural life in nudism , who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit .</s>

<s>in tradition and in poetry , the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony .</s>

<s>the partners each bring to it unselfish love , and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy .</s>

<s>at its most ecstatic moments , husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares .</s>

<s>everything else is closed away .</s>

<s>this is the ideal .</s>

<s>but marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved .</s>

<s>instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship .</s>

<s>in the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive .</s>

<s>but today there are signs that these roles are being reversed .</s>

<s>in a growing number of American homes , marriage counselors report , the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships .</s>

<s>it is she who decides the time , the place , the surroundings , and the frequency of the sexual act .</s>

<s>it is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics -- not the husband .</s>

<s>the whole act is tailored to her pleasure , and not to theirs .</s>

<s>beyond a certain point , of course , no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that .</s>

<s>but there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed .</s>

<s>of course , there remain many old-fashioned marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy .</s>

<s>yet even in these marriages , psychologists say , wives are asserting themselves more strongly .</s>

<s>the meekest , most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's or grandmother's standards .</s>

<s>to many experts , this trend was inevitable .</s>

<s>they consider it simply a sign of our times .</s>

<s>our society has emancipated the woman , giving her new independence and new authority .</s>

<s>it is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role .</s>

<s>the sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum , declares Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone , medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent book , Release From Sexual Tensions .</s>

<s>it reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself .</s>

<s>a world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive , too .</s>

<s>yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous .</s>

<s>it can , in fact , wreck a marriage .</s>

<s>when a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires , she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her .</s>

<s>and she begins to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy .</s>

<s>on the other hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity .</s>

<s>he is a target of ridicule to his wife , and often -- since private affairs rarely remain private -- to the outside world as well .</s>

<s>a marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's maleness , declares Dr. Calderone .</s>

<s>this opinion is supported by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists , Dr. Maurice E. Linden , director of the Mental Health Division of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health .</s>

<s>when the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower , Dr. Linden says , the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous .</s>

<s>in one extreme case , cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded .</s>

<s>to win her favors , her husband first took an additional job , then desperately began to embezzle from his employer .</s>

<s>caught at last , he was sentenced to prison .</s>

<s>while he was in custody his wife divorced him .</s>

<s>more typical is the case of a suburban Long Island housewife described by a marriage counselor .</s>

<s>this woman repeatedly complained she was too tired for marital relations .</s>

<s>to please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores .</s>

<s>finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing -- and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them .</s>

<s>one wife , described by a New York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly J meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood card parties .</s>

<s>another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis .</s>

<s>after every money argument , she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor .</s>

<s>experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed .</s>

<s>the wife is likely to be young , sophisticated , smart as a whip -- often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage .</s>

<s>she knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband .</s>

<s>the husband is usually a well-educated professional , preoccupied with his job -- often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is : don't rock the boat .</s>

<s>sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage .</s>

<s>hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area .</s>

<s>more often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home .</s>

<s>some psychologists , in fact , suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives .</s>

<s>the wife's attempt at control , these psychologists contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job .</s>

<s>naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative .</s>

<s>unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be consummated .</s>

<s>generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife's mercy .</s>

<s>the pattern , says Dr. Morton Schillinger , psychologist at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy , is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night .</s>

<s>no one seriously contends , of course , that the domineering wife is , sexually speaking , a new character in our world .</s>

<s>after all , the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing , in literature and on the stage , as Dr. Schillinger points out .</s>

<s>there is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom .</s>

<s>furthermore , Dr. Calderone says , a certain number of docile , retiring men always have been around .</s>

<s>they aren't frigid and they aren't homosexual ;
they're just restrained in all of life .</s>

<s>they like to be dominated .</s>

<s>one such man once confided to Dr. Theodor Reik , New York psychiatrist , that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor .</s>

<s>asked why , he replied primly : because that's no activity for a gentleman .</s>

<s>but such cases were , in the past , unusual .</s>

<s>society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male -- even the Bible appears to endorse the concept .</s>

<s>family survival on our own Western frontier , for example , could quite literally depend on a man's strength and ability to bring home the bacon ;
and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage bed .</s>

<s>this carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 20th centuries , when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring Life With Father manner .</s>

<s>in those days , a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere .</s>

<s>grandma wasn't expected to like it , Dr. Marion Hilliard , the late Toronto gynecologist , once summed up the attitude of the '90s .</s>

<s>wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as used by their husbands -- and , history indicates , they often quite literally were .</s>

<s>when was the turning point ?</s>

<s>when did women begin to assert themselves sexually ?</s>

<s>some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin .</s>

<s>virtually everyone agrees , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs .</s>

<s>left alone while her husband was miles away in the city , the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male .</s>

<s>circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing , money-handling and home maintenance .</s>

<s>she found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless .</s>

<s>she liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up .</s>

<s>very few wives , says Dr. Calderone , who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen , are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned .</s>

<s>a woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well .</s>

<s>and an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive -- the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response .</s>

<s>marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax .</s>

<s>they began to describe in detail the woman's capacity for response .</s>

<s>in fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , Dr. Albert Ellis , has declared flatly that women are sexually superior to men .</s>

<s>according to Dr. Ellis , the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner .</s>

<s>not surprisingly , Dr. Ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities .</s>

<s>yet , paradoxically , according to Dr. Maurice Linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them .</s>

<s>an aggressive woman wants a man to demand , not knuckle under .</s>

<s>when the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness , Dr. Linden says , the wife , in turn , finds him inadequate .</s>

<s>often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction .</s>

<s>one such wife , Dr. Linden says , became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man .</s>

<s>but her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover , too , had been conquered and reduced to passivity .</s>

<s>then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list .</s>

<s>in some cases , however , domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need .</s>

<s>thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be champion .</s>

<s>if his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern .</s>

<s>sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up .</s>

<s>on the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable .</s>

<s>or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted .</s>

<s>in any case , Dr. Calderone remarks , such problems are a couple's own affair , and can't always be measured by a general yardstick .</s>

<s>as long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex , it makes little difference if one or the other dominates , Dr. Calderone declares .</s>

<s>the important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment .</s>

<s>other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage .</s>

<s>and just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband .</s>

<s>to get a marriage back where it belongs , comments Dr. Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute , the husband must take some very basic steps .</s>

<s>he must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish .</s>

<s>he must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less understanding .</s>

<s>too many husbands , Dr. Schillinger continues , worry about how well they're doing , and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play .</s>

<s>early in her life she had discovered that where there were men , there was money , and with the two came luxury and liquor .</s>

<s>( Jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding a ring of high-priced call girls .

<s>Diane was needed as a material witness in the case and New York police searched three continents before they found her in their own back yard -- in a swank hotel , of course .</s>

<s>she had been moving in cafe society as Lady Diana Harrington , a name that made some of the gossip columns .</s>

<s>it was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best .</s>

<s>clad in mink and diamonds , she listened to Assistant District Attorney Anthony Liebler describe her to the arraigning judge : this girl is the Golden Girl of cafe society .</s>

<s>in 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County .</s>

<s>in the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to France , where she later met a very wealthy man and toured all Europe with him .</s>

<s>at Deauville she met an Egyptian by the name of Pulley Bey .</s>

<s>he was the official procurer for King Farouk , now in exile .</s>

<s>she was in Egypt during the revolution and had passport difficulty .</s>

<s>she lied in order to get it .</s>

<s>we have checked her in different parts of Europe and Egypt and finally back into this country she has been acting as a prostitute .</s>

<s>our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to Jelke .</s>

<s>Diane sobbingly denied this to the court .</s>

<s>that's a lie .</s>

<s>I never gave that boy a cent .</s>

<s>I am not a prostitute , and I had only one very wealthy boy friend , she said .</s>

<s>during the course of the trial , Jelke backed up part of that statement .</s>

<s>Diane is the type of girl , Jelke said , who wouldn't get loving -- even on her wedding night -- unless you piled up all your money in the middle of the floor .</s>

<s>but she seemed to have underestimated the number of her boy friends .</s>

<s>she came to New York from Detroit as a teenager , but with a sponsor instead of a chaperone .</s>

<s>as she told it , he's a rich boy friend , an old guy about 60 .</s>

<s>she was Mary Lou Brew then , wide-eyed , but not naive .</s>

<s>she had talked her boy friend into sending her to New York to take a screen test .</s>

<s>the screen test was never made -- but Diane was .</s>

<s>she quickly moved into cafe society , possibly easing her conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be in show business .</s>

<s>she seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail circuit set up a practical joke .</s>

<s>an ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as Mr. Warfield , the famous producer .</s>

<s>the phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows .</s>

<s>I'd love to audition for you , she gushed .</s>

<s>the audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's apartment .</s>

<s>she thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer how well she could dance .</s>

<s>after a few minutes he said , I can't use you if you dance like that .</s>

<s>I'd like to see you dance nude .</s>

<s>she hastily complied .</s>

<s>Diane loved to dance in the nude , something she was to demonstrate time and again .</s>

<s>she developed another quaint habit .</s>

<s>even among the fast set in which she was moving , her method for keeping an escort from departing too early was unique .</s>

<s>when the date would try to bid her good-night at the door , she would tell him , if you go home now , I'll scream .</s>

<s>more often than not he would bow to the inevitable .</s>

<s>one who needed no such threats was a French financier .</s>

<s>one of the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel .</s>

<s>she wanted to go around the world , but she settled for a French holiday .</s>

<s>in an anonymous interview with a French newspaper the financier told of spending several months with her .</s>

<s>then she went to Deauville where she met a member of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers .</s>

<s>the Greek evidently fell for her , Monsieur J recounted , and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he gave her 100,000 francs ( about $300 ) and led her to the roulette tables .</s>

<s>she could do no wrong at the tables that time .</s>

<s>and in short order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way .</s>

<s>smarter than most gamblers , she slipped away from the casino , packed her bag and took the night train to Paris .</s>

<s>no one ever learned what happened to the Greek .</s>

<s>the luxury of Paris' most fashionable hotel , the George 5 , bored the beautifully-built blonde , so she high-tailed it to Rome .</s>

<s>she teamed up with another beauty , whose name has been lost to history , and commenced with some fiddling that would have made Nero envious .</s>

<s>to climax her Roman revels , she was thrown out of the swanky Hotel Excelsior after she had run naked through its marble halls screaming for help .</s>

<s>it was a rugged finish for what must have been a very interesting night .</s>

<s>discreet Italian police described it in a manner typically continental .</s>

<s>there had been a threesome at the party in the suite's bedroom : Miss Harrington ( this was Diane's choice for a Roman name ) , another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and one of your well-known American actors .</s>

<s>the actor had had much to drink and apparently became very violent .</s>

<s>the hotel staff , as well as residents of the Excelsior , told us they saw that both ladies were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall .</s>

<s>they were wearing nothing but their scratches .</s>

<s>they were asked to leave the hotel .</s>

<s>no charges were filed .</s>

<s>the girls , after dressing , were indignant .</s>

<s>you can't do this to us , Diane screamed .</s>

<s>we are Americans .</s>

<s>in the morning she found rooms directly across from the Excelsior at the equally luxurious Hotel Ambassador .</s>

<s>with the Ambassador as headquarters , she continued to promote good will abroad .</s>

<s>of course , her benevolence was limited to those who could afford it , but then there is a limit to what one person can do .</s>

<s>by this time Diane was a beguiling lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world .</s>

<s>she thought royal status might come her way when , while she was still in Rome , she met Pulley Bey , a personal procurer to King Farouk of Egypt .</s>

<s>a close friend of hers in the Roman days described it this way : it was a strange relationship .</s>

<s>Diane spoke no Italian or French .</s>

<s>she had a hard time making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet .</s>

<s>you have it , all right .</s>

<s>leaving Lee's office , Mrs. Shaefer hurried over to her family physician , who treated her for burned tissue .</s>

<s>the sentence : 360 days' confinement in the county jail .</s>

<s>an isolated case of quackery ?</s>

<s>by no means .</s>

<s>rather , it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment of serious diseases .</s>

<s>the machine quack makes his Rube Goldberg devices out of odds and ends of metals , wires , and radio parts .</s>

<s>with these gadgets -- impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs , ticks , and buzzes -- he then carries out a vicious medical con game , capitalizing on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age .</s>

<s>he milks the latest scientific advances , translating them into his own special Buck Rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual impotence and cancer .</s>

<s>the gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines for $5 to $10,000 -- anything the traffic will bear .</s>

<s>he may call himself a anaprapath , a physiotherapist , an electrotherapist , a naturopath , a sanipractor , a medical cultist , a masseur , a doctor -- or what have you .</s>

<s>not only do these quacks assume impressive titles , but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations -- foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence .</s>

<s>the medical device pirate of today , of course , is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear -- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and other patent medicines .</s>

<s>his plunder is therefore far higher -- running into hundreds of millions .</s>

<s>according to the Food And Drug Administration ( FDA ) , Doctor Ghadiali , Dr. Albert Abrams and his clique , and Dr. Wilhelm Reich -- to name three notorious device quacks -- succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10,000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health machines .</s>

<s>authorities believe that many of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business .</s>

<s>look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in Cleveland .</s>

<s>Sarah Gross , a dress shop proprietor , paid $1020 to a masseur , and Mr. A. , a laborer , paid $4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines -- the radioclast and the diagnometer .</s>

<s>multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually .</s>

<s>you will come up with a frightening total .</s>

<s>that's why the J , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , and the National Better Business Bureau ( BBB ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical charlatans annually .</s>

<s>the Postmaster General recently reported that mail order frauds -- among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently -- are at the highest level in history .</s>

<s>similarly , the American Cancer Society ( ACS ) , the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation , and the J have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high .</s>

<s>for example , the J has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago .</s>

<s>authorities hesitate to quote exact figures , however , believing that any sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation -- turned up by their inevitably limited policing -- of the real loot of the medical racketeer .</s>

<s>in this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative .</s>

<s>the economic toll that the device quack extracts is important , of course .</s>

<s>but it is our health -- more precious than all the money in the world -- that these modern witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away .</s>

<s>by preying on the sick , by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate , by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care , these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity .</s>

<s>typically , Sarah Gross and Mr. J both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their Cleveland quacks .</s>

<s>Sarah Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her .</s>

<s>as a result , she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack doctor was using were phony .</s>

<s>she suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized .</s>

<s>Mr. A. , her fellow townsman , also experienced a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treating his wife -- a woman suffering from an incurable disease , multiple sclerosis -- and himself .</s>

<s>Mr. J has recovered , but he is , justifiably , a bitter man .</s>

<s>that's a lot of hard-earned money to lose , he says today .</s>

<s>neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor's treatments .</s>

<s>and there was the case of Tom Hepker , a machinist , who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what Doctor Fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine .</s>

<s>after his pains got worse , Tom decided to see a real doctor , from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung .</s>

<s>yes , Tom caught it in time to stay alive .</s>

<s>but he's a welfare case now -- a human wreck -- thanks to this modern witch doctor .</s>

<s>but the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering .</s>

<s>in such diseases as cancer , tuberculosis , and heart disease , early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with Doctor Fraud's cure-all gadget can prove fatal .</s>

<s>moreover , the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide .</s>

<s>for instance : in Chicago , some time ago , Mr. H. , age 27 , a diabetic since he was six , stopped using insulin because he had bought a magic spike -- a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent -- sold by the Vrilium Company of Chicago for $306 as a cure-all .</s>

<s>hang this around your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy , and its rays will cure any disease you have , said the company .</s>

<s>Mr. H. is dead today because he followed this advice .</s>

<s>Doris Hull , suffering from tuberculosis , was taken by her husband to see Otis G. Carroll , a sanipractor -- a licensed drugless healer -- in Spokane .</s>

<s>Carroll diagnosed Mrs.</s>

<s>Hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his radionic machine and twirling some knobs ( fee $50 ) .</s>

<s>his prescription : hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water .</s>

<s>although she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him , Carroll permitted her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water .</s>

<s>inevitably , Mrs.</s>

<s>Hull died of starvation and tuberculosis , weighing 60 pounds .</s>

<s>moreover , her husband and child contracted T.B.</s>

<s>from her .</s>

<s>( small wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $35,823 for his wife's death .

<s>in California , a few years ago , a ghoul by the name of H. F. Bell sold electric blankets as a cure for cancer .</s>

<s>he did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died , reconditioning them , and selling them at $185 each .</s>

<s>when authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license ( he got off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 77 ) , one of his victims was not around to testify : he was dead of cancer .</s>

<s>by no means are these isolated cases .</s>

<s>unfortunately , says Chief Postal Inspector David H. Stephens , who has prosecuted many device quacks , the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court .</s>

<s>death ]

<s>that's where device quackery can lead .</s>

<s>the evidence shows that fake therapeutic machines , substituted for valid medical cures , have hastened the deaths of thousands .</s>

<s>who are the victims of the device quacks ?</s>

<s>authorities say that oldsters are a prime target .</s>

<s>says Wallace F. Jannsen , director of the J Division of Public Information : quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people , or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis , rheumatism , diabetes , and cancer .</s>

<s>people who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in by quacks .</s>

<s>the victims of the quacks are frequently poor people , like Mr. A. , who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to Doctor Fraud's avarice .</s>

<s>they are often ignorant as well as underprivileged .</s>

<s>ten-year-old Richard Stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year .</s>

<s>his grades had gone steadily downhill , and he had stopped bringing friends and classmates home from school .</s>

<s>Mr. and Mrs. Stewart were puzzled and concerned .</s>

<s>then one day Dick's classmate Jimmy , from next door , let the cat out of the bag .</s>

<s>the youngsters in the boys' class had nicknamed Dick Bugs Bunny because his teeth protruded .</s>

<s>when Richard's parents told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist -- a dentist who specializes in realigning teeth and jaws -- their young son was interested .</s>

<s>during the year that followed , Dick co-operated whole-heartedly with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved -- an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his facial appearance .</s>

<s>Richard Stewart is no special case .</s>

<s>the majority of children in the United States could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment , says Dr. Allan G. Brodie , professor and head of the department of orthodontics at the University of Illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field .</s>

<s>what do parents need to know about those years of the braces in order not to waste a child's time and their money ?</s>

<s>how can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment ?</s>

<s>why and when should tooth-straightening be undertaken ?</s>

<s>what is it likely to cost ?</s>

<s>tooth fit explained
occlusion is the dentist's expression for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed .</s>

<s>malocclusion , or a bad fit , is what parents need to look out for .</s>

<s>one main type of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper front teeth .</s>

<s>a chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face , a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth , an overdeveloped lower jawbone , and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion .</s>

<s>these two basic malformations have , of course , many variations .</s>

<s>a child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions : a noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw .</s>

<s>crooked , overlapping , twisted , or widely spaced teeth .</s>

<s>front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close .</s>

<s>upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back teeth close .</s>

<s>the eyeteeth ( third from the middle on top , counting each front tooth as the first ) beginning to protrude like fangs .</s>

<s>second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out , making a double row .</s>

<s>contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago , when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate habit , recent studies show that most tooth irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition .</s>

<s>however , this does not mean that a child's teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family .</s>

<s>tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb- or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking -- but it's important to remember that there's a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits .</s>

<s>it's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old .</s>

<s>occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect a youngster's teeth ;
but after that , if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent , it will have an effect .</s>

<s>malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long .</s>

<s>if a child loses a molar at the age of two , the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space , thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble .</s>

<s>if baby teeth are retained too long , the incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or may have to erupt in the wrong place .</s>

<s>correction can save teeth
every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by their malformed teeth .</s>

<s>some such youngsters rarely smile , or they try to speak with the mouth closed .</s>

<s>in certain cases , as in Dick Stewart's , a child's personality is affected .</s>

<s>yet from the dentist's point of view , bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons .</s>

<s>bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots .</s>

<s>this serious condition , popularly known as pyorrhea , is one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults .</s>

<s>then , too , misplaced or jammed-together teeth are prone to trapping food particles , increasing the likelihood of rapid decay .</s>

<s>for these and other reasons , says Dr. Brodie , orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth .</s>

<s>the failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal chewing , so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive system .</s>

<s>because of these chewing troubles , a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition .</s>

<s>badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping .</s>

<s>the when and how of straightening
most orthodontic work is done on children between the ages of 10 and 14 , though there have been patients as young as two and as old as 55 , says Dr. Brodie .</s>

<s>in the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed , yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy .</s>

<s>orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly , by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network , to the bone in the jaw ;
they are not anchored directly to the bone .</s>

<s>abnormal pressure , applied over a period of time , produces a change in the bony deposit , so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided .</s>

<s>what can 10-year-old Susan expect when she enters the orthodontist's office ?</s>

<s>on her first visit the orthodontist will take x-rays , photographs , tooth measurements , and tooth prints -- an impression of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws .</s>

<s>if he decides to proceed , he will custom-make for Susie an appliance consisting of bands , plastic plates , fine wires , and tiny springs .</s>

<s>this appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone .</s>

<s>as the tooth moves , bone cells on the pressure side of it will dissolve , and new ones will form on the side from which the tooth has moved .</s>

<s>this must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows , and no faster .</s>

<s>if teeth are moved too rapidly , serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place , explains Dr. Brodie .</s>

<s>moving one or two teeth can affect the whole system , and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child's face .</s>

<s>during the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment , Susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness , but after a short time this will disappear .</s>

<s>parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay .</s>

<s>when in place , a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth that is covered .</s>

<s>next Susie will enter the treatment stage and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month , depending on the severity of her condition .</s>

<s>during these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth .</s>

<s>last comes the retention stage .</s>

<s>Susie's teeth have now been guided into a desirable new position .</s>

<s>but because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position , a retaining appliance is used to lock them in place .</s>

<s>usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth .</s>

<s>Susie may wear this only at night or for a few hours during the day .</s>

<s>then comes the time when the last wire is removed and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist .</s>

<s>how long will this take ?</s>

<s>straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months .</s>

<s>aligning all the teeth may take a year or more .</s>

<s>an added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct .</s>

<s>what is the cost ?</s>

<s>the charge for a complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country .</s>

<s>work that might cost $500 to $750 in the South could cost $750 to $1,200 in New York City or Chicago .</s>

<s>an average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1,000 .</s>

<s>factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the practitioner , says Dr. Brodie .</s>

<s>to become an orthodontist , a man must first be licensed by his state as a dentist , then he must spend at least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist .</s>

<s>costs may seem high , but they used to be even higher , says Dr. Brodie .</s>

<s>fees are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago .</s>

<s>the reason ?</s>

<s>people today are aware of the value of orthodontics , and as a result there are more practitioners in the field .</s>

<s>most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances , but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years .</s>

<s>in many cities in the United States clinics associated with dental schools will take patients at a nominal fee .</s>

<s>some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents .</s>

<s>research helps families
growth studies have been carried on consistently by orthodontists .</s>

<s>Dr. Brodie has 30-year records of head growth , started 20 minutes after children's births .</s>

<s>in the past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was scoffed at ;
now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent , he says .</s>

<s>fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does , and that helps us know what we can do .</s>

<s>this knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis and treatment .</s>

<s>for example , a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another .</s>

<s>in the past an orthodontist might have tried , over four or five years , to straighten and fit the boy's large teeth into a jaw that , despite some growth , would never accommodate them .</s>

<s>now a dentist can recommend extraction immediately .</s>

<s>in other cases , in view of present-day knowledge of head growth , orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment .</s>

<s>the child is kept on call , and the orthodontist watches the growth .</s>

<s>nature often takes care of the problem , says Dr. Brodie .</s>

<s>a child with a certain type of head and teeth will outgrow tooth deformity .</s>

<s>that is why Dr. Brodie asks parents not to insist , against their dentist's advice , that their child have orthodontic work done too early .</s>

<s>both because of our culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions , some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it is wise to do so .</s>

<s>let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment , he urges .</s>

<s>superior new material for orthodontic work is another result of research .</s>

<s>plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used , and they save time and money .</s>

<s>plaster of Paris , once utilized in making impressions of teeth , has been replaced by alginates ( gelatin-like material ) that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child .</s>

<s>prevention is best
as a rule , the earlier general dental treatment is started , the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be .</s>

<s>after your child's baby teeth are all in -- usually at the age of two and one half to three -- it's time for that first dental appointment , Dr. Brodie advises .</s>

<s>then see that your youngster has a routine checkup once a year .</s>

<s>to help prevent orthodontic problems from arising , your dentist can do these things : he can correct decay , thus preventing early loss of teeth .</s>

<s>if a child does lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay -- and if no preventive steps are taken -- the other teeth may shift out of position , become overcrowded and malformed .</s>

<s>in turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them .</s>

<s>from time to time the medium mentions other people around him , who were on the other side , and reports what they are saying .</s>

<s>after a while there come initials and names , and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames .</s>

<s>as the hour progresses , the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements .</s>

<s>there are a few prognoses of coming events .</s>

<s>another medium , another sitter , would produce a somewhat different content , but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading .</s>

<s>some mediums speak in practical , down-to-earth terms , while others may stress the spiritual .</s>

<s>not all , as a matter of fact , consider themselves mediums in the sense of receiving messages from the deceased .</s>

<s>in fact , some sensitives rule this out , preferring to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception ( ESP ) , on this side of the veil .</s>

<s>however that may be , people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons .</s>

<s>perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort , to feel in touch with the deceased , or seek indications for future plans .</s>

<s>they may , of course , be curiosity seekers -- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship .</s>

<s>the mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state , so that the sitter can make comments , ask and answer questions , instead of talking with a control who speaks through an entranced sensitive .</s>

<s>what we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation .</s>

<s>but it is not really only a conversation .</s>

<s>many a sitter ( in a personal sitting ) has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind .</s>

<s>he himself might not have been really aware of his own mood ;
it had been latent , unspecified , semi-conscious and only partly realized -- until she described it to him ]
most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability to put a finger on pre-conscious moods and to clarify them .</s>

<s>however , in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium , he did not receive a personal reading .</s>

<s>instead he brought with him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing .</s>

<s>for this was to be a proxy sitting .</s>

<s>as was noted earlier , it is important that in valid , objective study of this sort of communication , the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive .</s>

<s>Dr. Karlis Osis , Director of Research at the Parapsychology Foundation , described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article , ( New Research On Survival After Death , Spring 1958 ) .</s>

<s>he remarked : it has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter .</s>

<s>the possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's J may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated .</s>

<s>one way to do this is by proxy sittings , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter .</s>

<s>if the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name ( given by the experimenter ) , he cannot possibly give any clues , conscious or unconscious , far less ask leading questions .</s>

<s>all he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner , seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions .</s>

<s>sometimes in these experiments appointment sittings are used .</s>

<s>here the absent sitter makes a date with a communicator ( someone close to him who is deceased ) , asking him to come in at a certain hour , when a channel will be open for him .</s>

<s>in this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator , nothing else .</s>

<s>he gives this to the medium at the appointed time , and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the communicator .</s>

<s>as always , a tape recording or detailed notes are made , and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter .</s>

<s>so this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier between the medium's J and the absent sitter's mind .</s>

<s>it is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements -- though research still does not know how far afield J can range .</s>

<s>now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him .</s>

<s>here again laboratory approaches are being evolved , for it is recognized how elastic these readings can be , how they can apply to many people , and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case .</s>

<s>if you look at a reading meant for someone else , you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you , even when you were not in the picture at all ]
an interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a hit , describing something accurately for him , but can he really be sure that another sitter , hearing the same statement , would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances ?</s>

<s>it is , of course , easy to see how J will mean Uncle Jack to one person and little Jane to another .</s>

<s>a journey , a little white house , a change of outlook , can apply to many people .</s>

<s>and even more complex items can be interpreted to conform to one's own point of view , which is by nature so personal .</s>

<s>one sitter may think a leather couch identifies a reading as surely directed to him ;
to another , it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase , atta boy ]
to get around this quite difficult corner , there is one first aid to objectiveness : prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him .</s>

<s>if he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him , he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame : does that statement really sound as if it were for me , significant in my particular life ?</s>

<s>or am I taking something that could really apply to almost anybody , and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar experience ?</s>

<s>conversely , experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following , which , if they turned out to be hits , are so unusual as to be really significant : he had four children , two sets of twins .</s>

<s>after being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying for the ministry .</s>

<s>part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road .</s>

<s>he died of typhoid in 1921 .</s>

<s>methods have been developed of assigning weights to statements ;
that is , it is known empirically that names beginning with J are more common than those beginning with J ;
that fewer women are named Miranda than Elizabeth ;
that in the United States more people die of heart disease than of smallpox .</s>

<s>so each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these weights .</s>

<s>specific dates would be important , as would double names .</s>

<s>various categories have been explored to find out about these empirical probabilities against which to measure the readings .</s>

<s>in the parapsychology foundation's long-range experiment , readings are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating sitters , trying to throw light on this question of the significance of mediumistic statements .</s>

<s>it is very important indeed , in the field of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis , to know whether the statements are actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself .</s>

<s>or , on the other hand , are unlikely facts being stated , facts which are in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody ?</s>

<s>that is one thing the experiments are designed to find out .</s>

<s>so , after the sitting has been held , several readings at one time are mailed , and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose communicator's name was given to the medium ) must mark each little item as Correct ( Hit ) , Incorrect ( Miss ) , Doubtful , or Especially Significant ( applying to him and , he feels , not to anyone else ) .</s>

<s>he is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his .</s>

<s>all these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated , by adding up the Hits and Significants , with the weight placed on those in the sitter's own reading .</s>

<s>that is , if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him , the total experimental score falls .</s>

<s>conversely , if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading , and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others , a point is chalked up for the intrinsic , objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material .</s>

<s>and there are some positive results , though the final findings will not be known for a long time -- and then further research can be formulated .</s>

<s>in another approach to the same procedure , the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to slant her statements .</s>

<s>does she often speak of locations , of cause of death ?</s>

<s>does she accurately give dates , ages , kind of occupation ?</s>

<s>it is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall , and where she makes most of her hits .</s>

<s>now when , so to speak , the cream has been skimmed off , and the items in the successful categories separated out , the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated cream , where the sensitive is at her best .</s>

<s>mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses .</s>

<s>I feel cold , the medium says , or my leg aches , my head is heavy .</s>

<s>or perhaps she hears words or sounds : there's such a noise of loud machinery , or I hear a child crying , or he says we're all here and glad to see you .</s>

<s>maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness , with action and motion , or a static view : a house under a pine tree , with a little stone path going up to the door .</s>

<s>the sensitive often seems to smell definite odors , too , or subjectively feels emotions .</s>

<s>sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective , as if the scene were actually there .</s>

<s>if pressed by the sitter for more detail , she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply , almost as if she were physically going closer .</s>

<s>if asked how she gets her impressions , she probably can only say that she just gets them -- some more vividly than others .</s>

<s>perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all .</s>

<s>even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how -- of atmosphere , of one another's personalities , moods , intentions .</s>

<s>of course , there is an element of training here : these gifted people , by concentration , study , guidance , have learned to develop their power .</s>

<s>simply using it increases its intensity , I was told by one sensitive .</s>

<s>nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her imagery .</s>

<s>impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value .</s>

<s>it is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious , and the medium has to translate these into meaning .</s>

<s>if communication with an entity on the other side is taking place , this too may assume the form of clairvoyant symbolism .</s>

<s>during one reading an image appeared of a prisoner in irons .</s>

<s>but this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail ;
taken with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement .</s>

<s>in this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained .</s>

<s>though they are often heard clairaudiently , as if a voice were speaking them , in other cases they are apprehended visually as symbols : a slope to signify the name Hill , for instance .</s>

<s>one medium saw two sheets flapping on a line and found that the name Shietz was significant to the sitter .</s>

<s>farming is confining .</s>

<s>the farmer's life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock .</s>

<s>livestock must be tended every day , routinely .</s>

<s>a slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens .</s>

<s>even if there are no livestock , the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing season .</s>

<s>the worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily .</s>

<s>he cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice ;
such a move may mean a loss of capital .</s>

<s>hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life .</s>

<s>the farmer must get up early , and , at times , work late at night .</s>

<s>frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain .</s>

<s>no matter how well work is planned , bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up .</s>

<s>it may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably .</s>

<s>production may fall far below expectations .</s>

<s>drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops .</s>

<s>sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner's earnings , even into his capital .</s>

<s>returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year .</s>

<s>the high cost of land , supplies , and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis .</s>

<s>land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has subdivision possibilities .</s>

<s>part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities .</s>

<s>if the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high , farm labor costs will also be high .</s>

<s>a part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen , per cow , or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer .</s>

<s>it will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment .</s>

<s>he may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations , such as spraying or threshing , and for these , he may have to wait his turn .</s>

<s>there will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off-farm job .</s>

<s>the farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost .</s>

<s>this may be true whether the farm is owned or rented .</s>

<s>if the farm is rented , the rent must be paid .</s>

<s>if it is owned , taxes must be paid , and if the place is not free of mortgage , there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of .</s>

<s>advantages
a farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children .</s>

<s>it gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air .</s>

<s>the children can do chores adapted to their age and ability .</s>

<s>caring for a calf , a pig , or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work .</s>

<s>part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost , provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs .</s>

<s>for some retired persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income .</s>

<s>it is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health .</s>

<s>generally , the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city .</s>

<s>the savings are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed .</s>

<s>usually , the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more .</s>

<s>where schools , fire and police protection , and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country , real estate taxes are usually about the same .</s>

<s>a part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably .</s>

<s>some persons consider the work on a farm recreational .</s>

<s>for some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job , and a physical conditioner .</s>

<s>land , labor , and equipment needed
part-time farming can take comparatively little land , labor , and equipment -- or a great deal .</s>

<s>it depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation .</s>

<s>general requirements for land , labor , and equipment are discussed below .</s>

<s>specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 .</s>

<s>land
three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use , and for a small flock of chickens , a cow , and two pigs .</s>

<s>you could not , of course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small .</s>

<s>if you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale , you'll need more land .</s>

<s>in deciding how much land you want , take into account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect .</s>

<s>but consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work .</s>

<s>the cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision .</s>

<s>some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development .</s>

<s>this is a highly speculative venture .</s>

<s>sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract .</s>

<s>when surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up , it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm .</s>

<s>labor
if you have a year-round , full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your family uses -- unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help .</s>

<s>as a rule , part-time farmers hire little help .</s>

<s>in deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 .</s>

<s>list the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month .</s>

<s>you may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one .</s>

<s>do not include all your spare time or all your family's spare time -- only what you are willing to use for farm work .</s>

<s>equipment
if you are going to produce for home use only , you will need only hand tools .</s>

<s>you will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing , however .</s>

<s>for larger plantings , you'll need some kind of power for plowing , harrowing , disking , and cultivating .</s>

<s>if you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor ( available for $300 to $500 with attachments , 1960 prices ) .</s>

<s>these tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing , particularly on heavier soils , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing .</s>

<s>cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer .</s>

<s>if you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises .</s>

<s>you can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery , by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs .</s>

<s>if an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed -- such as a spray rig , a combine , or a binder -- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work .</s>

<s>selecting a farm
before you look for a farm you'll need to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake ;
and ( 2 ) whether you want to buy or rent .</s>

<s>information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture .</s>

<s>if you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate , or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming , usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy .</s>

<s>discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm .</s>

<s>location nearness to work .</s>

<s>--
choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities .</s>

<s>then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell the farm .</s>

<s>the presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable .</s>

<s>obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road .</s>

<s>nearness to markets .</s>

<s>--
if you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby .</s>

<s>if you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk , for example , you should be close to a town or city .</s>

<s>kind of neighborhood .</s>

<s>--
look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes .</s>

<s>there are slums in the country as well as in the city .</s>

<s>few rural areas are protected by zoning .</s>

<s>a tavern , filling station , junk yard , rendering plant , or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value .</s>

<s>facilities in the area .</s>

<s>--
check on the schools in the area , the quality of teaching , and the provision for transportation to and from them .</s>

<s>find out whether fire protection , sewage system , gas , water mains , and electrical lines are available in the locality .</s>

<s>if these facilities are not at the door , getting them may cost more than you expect .</s>

<s>you may have to provide them yourself or get along without them .</s>

<s>you cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water .</s>

<s>if you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well , find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled .</s>

<s>a pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden .</s>

<s>pond water can be filtered for human use , but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble .</s>

<s>the following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses .</s>

<s>topography and soil
is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise ?</s>

<s>if you can't tell , get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist .</s>

<s>soil type , drainage , or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones .</s>

<s>small areas that aren't right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop .</s>

<s>the house
will the house on any part-time farm you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence ?</s>

<s>how much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating ?</s>

<s>if the house is not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating system must be installed , check into the cost of making these improvements .</s>

<s>buying a farm
the value of the farm to you will depend on -- its worth as a place to live .</s>

<s>the value of the products you can raise on it .</s>

<s>the possibilities of selling the property later on for suburban subdivision .</s>

<s>decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town .</s>

<s>take into account the difference in city and county taxes , insurance rates , utility rates , and the cost of travel to work .</s>

<s>next , estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm .</s>

<s>to do this , set up a plan on paper for operating the farm .</s>

<s>list the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year .</s>

<s>estimate the value of the produce at normal prices .</s>

<s>the total is the probably gross income from farming .</s>

<s>to find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming .</s>

<s>include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment .</s>

<s>also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family .</s>

<s>it may be hard to decide what this labor is worth , but charge something for it .</s>

<s>otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor .</s>

<s>to figure the value of the farm in terms of investment income , divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way .</s>

<s>everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge .</s>

<s>for almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned .</s>

<s>one who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers .</s>

<s>the gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten -- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star of David -- nor the gratuitous sadism of J officers .</s>

<s>public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out : too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect .</s>

<s>and still another witness , one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses , had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot .</s>

<s>most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant's Department of Jewish Affairs .</s>

<s>counsel for the defense , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections , rarely raised an objection .</s>

<s>would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming , if not exhausting , effect likely to improve his client's chances ?</s>

<s>those who feared emotionalism at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr. Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies .</s>

<s>interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the Attorney General for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke off the flow .</s>

<s>but there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem and those in Moscow and New York .</s>

<s>in each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course : in Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin's dictatorship ;
in the United States the initiation of militant anti-Communism , with the repentant ex-Communist in the vanguard .</s>

<s>these trials were properly termed political cases in that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences .</s>

<s>but what could the Eichmann Trial initiate ?</s>

<s>of what new course could it mark the beginning ?</s>

<s>the Eichmann case looked to the past , not to the future .</s>

<s>it was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refining the recollection , that will last as long as there are Jews .</s>

<s>as such , it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a message .</s>

<s>it is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial -- said Ben Gurion , and not the Nazi regime alone -- but anti-Semitism throughout history .</s>

<s>how could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism ?</s>

<s>and if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the Trial , as we shall observe later , all but scuttled in the attempt to prove Eichmann a fiend ?</s>

<s>these questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution's case .</s>

<s>it might be contended , of course , that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism .</s>

<s>but in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment .</s>

<s>in such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument .</s>

<s>one who could be linked to anti-Semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages .</s>

<s>shout at Eichmann though he might , the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-Semitism .</s>

<s>yes , he believed that the Jews were enemies of the Reich , and such a belief is , of course , typical of patriotic anti-Semites ;
but he believed in the Jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract , theological way , like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things .</s>

<s>the real question was how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder , and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself .</s>

<s>in regard to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent .</s>

<s>perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could , as Eichmann declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer .</s>

<s>not through fear of disobeying orders , as Eichmann kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler's victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal , and the more outrageous the better , well , let's try it .</s>

<s>at any rate , the substance of Eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the J , and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews , his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to that extent .</s>

<s>but if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it .</s>

<s>if anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann's Department of Jewish Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as well as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ?</s>

<s>the infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942 , to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe , was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state , including the Reich Minister of the Interior , the State Secretary in charge of the Four Year Plan , the Reich Minister of Justice , the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs .</s>

<s>the measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government .</s>

<s>Heydrich , in opening the Conference , followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as a complement to previous solutions for eliminating the Jews from German living space through violence , economic strangulation , forced emigration , and evacuation .</s>

<s>in other words , the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life , and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective , as a readiness for murder .</s>

<s>this , in fact , it turned out to be .</s>

<s>since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons controlling German industries , social institutions , and armed forces became , through their anti-Semitism or their tolerance of it , conscious accomplices of Hitler's crimes ;
whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually .</s>

<s>what more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable Anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ?</s>

<s>not in Eichmann's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial .</s>

<s>no doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had conceived their anti-Semitism as an innocent dislike of Jews , as do others like them today .</s>

<s>the Final Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others .</s>

<s>ought not an edifying Trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of mere anti-Semites were drawn step by step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings ?</s>

<s>the Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to the germ of anti-Semitism among the Germans which Hitler stimulated and transformed .</s>

<s>but if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann's head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it .</s>

<s>nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states .</s>

<s>certainly , one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon .</s>

<s>Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors .</s>

<s>do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations , splitting apart individuals and groups , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses , pulverizing trust and personal dignity , and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes ?</s>

<s>the career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew , he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ;
clinging to the enemy-Jew idea , he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ;
once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him .</s>

<s>is this the type of citizen you desire ?</s>

<s>the Trial should have asked the nations .</s>

<s>but though this characterization in no way diminished Eichmann's guilt , the Prosecutor , more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one , would have none of it .</s>

<s>finally , if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism , how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters -- i.e.</s>

<s>, Germany , Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia -- and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity -- Denmark , Holland , Italy , Bulgaria , France ?</s>

<s>should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ?</s>

<s>wasn't this meaning of Eichmann's experience in various countries worth highlighting ?</s>

<s>as the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage , the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps , a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ) .</s>

<s>only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin .</s>

<s>it is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe .</s>

<s>it is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable ;
most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and investigating commissions , and by reports , memoirs , and survivors' accounts .</s>

<s>in Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , in 1952 , a Roman Catholic hospital presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff .</s>

<s>three agreed , but four declined and were suspended .</s>

<s>after a flood of protests , they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953 .</s>

<s>the peace of the community was badly disturbed , and people across the nation , reading of the incident , felt uneasy .</s>

<s>in New York City in 1958 , the city's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device .</s>

<s>he thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants , Jews and Roman Catholics that continued for two months , until the city's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy .</s>

<s>a year later in Albany , N.Y. , a Roman Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood Association .</s>

<s>immediately , the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's right to freedom of religious belief and conscience .</s>

<s>these incidents , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension , rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue .</s>

<s>it has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies .</s>

<s>it has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries .</s>

<s>where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano , ready to explode at any moment .</s>

<s>the time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation .</s>

<s>the first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level .</s>

<s>instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached .</s>

<s>all too frequently , points out James O'Gara , managing editor of Commonweal , Catholics run roughshod over Protestant sensibilities in this matter , by failure to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position and , particularly , by their jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades .</s>

<s>all too often our language is unduly harsh .</s>

<s>the second step is to recognize the substantial agreement -- frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting -- already existing between Catholics and Non-Catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family planning .</s>

<s>instead of Catholics' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many Non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed .</s>

<s>family planning is encouraged , so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring .</s>

<s>Pope Pius 12 declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the whole duration of married life , if there are serious reasons , such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social indications .</s>

<s>this means that such factors as the health of the parents , particularly the mother , their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life , the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring .</s>

<s>these are substantially the same factors considered by Non-Catholics in family planning .</s>

<s>the laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons .</s>

<s>the Roman Catholic Church , however , sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning .</s>

<s>Catholics , Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning , but disagree over the methods to be used .</s>

<s>the Roman Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method , also known as the use of the infertile or safe period .</s>

<s>the Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author : it involves no frustration of nature's laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them .</s>

<s>with the exception of the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , allowing the couple free choice .</s>

<s>there is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement .</s>

<s>the grounds for the Church's position are Scriptural ( Old Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law .</s>

<s>the latter plays a prominent role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture , in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods .</s>

<s>the Roman Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end .</s>

<s>this conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain given physical arrangements .</s>

<s>thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race .</s>

<s>moreover , man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by God , who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception .</s>

<s>believing that God is the Author of this law and of all laws of nature , Roman Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws , not frustrate or mock them .</s>

<s>let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable .</s>

<s>but people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines , without taking up arms against those who disagree with them .</s>

<s>why is it so different in regard to birth control ?</s>

<s>it is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief , or at least the practical consequences thereof upon others .</s>

<s>it is always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others .</s>

<s>both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past .</s>

<s>consider what happened during World War 1 , when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law through Congress .</s>

<s>many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful .</s>

<s>with over four million American men away at war , Protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public .</s>

<s>with the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens .</s>

<s>the attempt to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers , racketeers , hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history .</s>

<s>the so-called noble experiment came to an inglorious end .</s>

<s>that tumultuous , painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society .</s>

<s>that experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today .</s>

<s>up to the turn of the century , contraception was condemned by all Christian churches as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine law .</s>

<s>this was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian countries .</s>

<s>today , the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction .</s>

<s>the various Lambeth Conferences , expressing the Anglican viewpoint , mirror the gradual change that has taken place among Protestants generally .</s>

<s>in 1920 , the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception , together with the grave dangers -- physical , moral , and religious -- thereby incurred , and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race .</s>

<s>denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself , the Conference declared : we steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of Christian marriage .</s>

<s>one is the primary purpose for which marriage exists , namely , the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children ;
the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control .</s>

<s>the Conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives .</s>

<s>in 1930 , the Lambeth Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances , contraception might be morally legitimate .</s>

<s>in 1958 , the Conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere .</s>

<s>many other Protestant denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action .</s>

<s>in March , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of Churches ratified artificial methods of birth control .</s>

<s>as to the necessity , the committee declared , for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children , and consequently of control of conception , there can be no question .</s>

<s>there is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right .</s>

<s>since then , many Protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not only approved birth control , but declared it at times to be a religious duty .</s>

<s>what determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive in general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical .</s>

<s>this development is reflected in the action taken in February , 1961 , by the general board of the National Council of Churches , the largest Protestant organization in the J .</s>

<s>the board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning .</s>

<s>it called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives .</s>

<s>the general board declared : most of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right .</s>

<s>the general Protestant conviction is that motives , rather than methods , form the primary moral issue , provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception .</s>

<s>an action once universally condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant denominations , but also deemed , at certain times , to be a positive religious duty .</s>

<s>this viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country .</s>

<s>repeated polls have disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control .</s>

<s>for all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far-reaching .</s>

<s>to try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment .</s>

<s>this brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : they are moral judgments and matters of theological belief .</s>

<s>conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : the civil law is concerned with public crimes .</s>

<s>only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin .</s>

<s>among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion itself .</s>

<s>on April 17 , 1610 , the sturdy little three-masted bark , Discovery , weighed anchor in St. Katherine's Pool , London , and floated down the Thames toward the sea .</s>

<s>she carried , besides her captain , a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic waters of North America .</s>

<s>seventeen months later , on September 6 , 1611 , an Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway Bay .</s>

<s>when she reached port , she was found to have on board only eight men , all near starvation .</s>

<s>the captain was gone , and the mate was gone .</s>

<s>the man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman .</s>

<s>what disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months ?</s>

<s>what happened to the fourteen missing men ?</s>

<s>these questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time .</s>

<s>for hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted of ( 1 ) the captain's fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man's desk on board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports .</s>

<s>all told , they offered a highly confused picture .</s>

<s>but since 1927 , researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information .</s>

<s>not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage .</s>

<s>historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations .</s>

<s>first , they wanted to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma .</s>

<s>second , they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain -- a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps , on American towns and counties , on a great American river , and on half a million square miles of Arctic seas .</s>

<s>the name : Henry Hudson .</s>

<s>this is the story of his last tragic voyage , as nearly as we are able -- or ever , probably , will be able -- to determine : the sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years .</s>

<s>each time his objective had been the same -- a direct water passage from Western Europe to the Far East .</s>

<s>in 1607 and 1608 , the English Muscovy Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole or across the top of Russia .</s>

<s>twice he had failed , and the Muscovy Company indicated it would not back him again .</s>

<s>in 1609 , the Dutch East India Company hired Hudson , gave him two learned geographers , fitted him out with a ship called the Half Moon , and supplied him with Dutch sailors .</s>

<s>this time he turned westward , to the middle Atlantic coast of North America .</s>

<s>his chief discovery was important -- the Great North ( later , the Hudson ) River -- but it produced no northwest passage .</s>

<s>when the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth , England , in the fall of 1609 , word of Hudson's findings leaked out , and English interest in him revived .</s>

<s>the government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship .</s>

<s>he thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth .</s>

<s>by springtime , he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry , Prince of Wales .</s>

<s>he had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one , the largest he had ever commanded .</s>

<s>the purpose of this fourth voyage was clear .</s>

<s>a century of exploration had established that a great land mass , North and South America , lay between Europe and the Indies .</s>

<s>one by one , the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded .</s>

<s>in fact , Hudson's sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes .</s>

<s>but there remained one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to the north .</s>

<s>nearly twenty-five years before , Captain John Davis had noted , as he sailed near the Arctic Circle , a very great gulf , the water whirling and roaring , as it were the meeting of tides .</s>

<s>he named this opening , between Baffin Island and Labrador , the Furious Overfall .</s>

<s>( later , it was to be called Hudson Strait .
)</s>

<s>in 1602 , George Waymouth , in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded , had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back .</s>

<s>Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway .</s>

<s>even Hudson , experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he was , must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames .</s>

<s>ahead were perilous , ice-filled waters .</s>

<s>on previous voyages , it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain .</s>

<s>on the second voyage , he had turned back at the frozen island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will -- which was obviously not the case .</s>

<s>on the third voyage , a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch and English crew members on the Half Moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam in Mid-Atlantic .</s>

<s>worse , his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before .</s>

<s>of only one could he be sure -- young John Hudson , his second son .</s>

<s>the mate , Robert Juet , who had kept the journal on the Half Moon , was experienced -- but he was a bitter old man , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity .</s>

<s>Philip Staffe , the ship's carpenter , was a good worker , but perversely independent .</s>

<s>Arnold Lodley and Michael Perse were like the rest -- lukewarm , ready to swing against Hudson in a crisis .</s>

<s>but men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find .</s>

<s>Hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer .</s>

<s>and he refused to be anything else .</s>

<s>it is believed that Hudson was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was trained on company ships .</s>

<s>he was a Londoner , married , with three sons .</s>

<s>( the common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage .
)</s>

<s>in 1610 , Hudson was probably in his early forties , a good navigator , a stubborn voyager , but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession .</s>

<s>Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the Thames .</s>

<s>there at the river's edge waited one Henry Greene , whom Hudson listed as a clerk .</s>

<s>Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent , who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred -- pimps , panders and whores .</s>

<s>he was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had Greene wait at Gravesend , where the Discovery picked him up .</s>

<s>for the first three weeks , the ship skirted up the east coast of Great Britain , then turned westward .</s>

<s>on May 11 , she reached Iceland .</s>

<s>poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called Lousie Bay .</s>

<s>the subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome .</s>

<s>with Hudson looking on , his protege Greene picked a fight with the ship's surgeon , Edward Wilson .</s>

<s>the issue was settled on shore , Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore , determined to catch the next fishing boat back to England .</s>

<s>with difficulty , Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship , and they sailed from Iceland .</s>

<s>early in June , the Discovery passed Desolation ( southern Greenland ) and in mid-June entered the Furious Overfall .</s>

<s>floating ice bore down from the north and west .</s>

<s>fog hung over the route constantly .</s>

<s>turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet .</s>

<s>the ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic North Pole .</s>

<s>as the bergs grew larger , Hudson was forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay , an inlet of the Great Strait .</s>

<s>after finding that its coasts led nowhere , however , he turned north again , toward the main , ice-filled passageway -- and the crew , at first uneasy , then frightened , rebelled .</s>

<s>the trouble was at least partly Juet's doing .</s>

<s>for weeks he had been saying that Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd .</s>

<s>the great , crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason .</s>

<s>a group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther .</s>

<s>instead of quelling the dissension , as many captains of the era would have done ( Sir Francis Drake lopped a man's head off under similar circumstances ) , Hudson decided to be reasonable .</s>

<s>he went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart , which he set up in view of the crew .</s>

<s>patiently , he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives .</s>

<s>when Hudson had finished , the town meeting broke down into a general , wordy argument .</s>

<s>one man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds , he would give ninety of them to be back in England .</s>

<s>up spoke carpenter Staffe , who said he wouldn't give ten pounds to be home .</s>

<s>the statement was effective .</s>

<s>the meeting broke up .</s>

<s>Hudson was free to sail on .</s>

<s>all through July the Discovery picked her way along the 450-mile-long strait , avoiding ice and rocky islands .</s>

<s>on August 3 , two massive headlands reared out of the mists -- great gateways never before , so far as Hudson knew , seen by Europeans .</s>

<s>to starboard was a cape a thousand feet high , patched with ice and snow , populated by thousands of screaming sea birds .</s>

<s>to port was a point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of 2,000 feet .</s>

<s>Hudson named the capes Digges and Wolstenholme , for two of his backers .</s>

<s>Hudson pointed the Discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea ( now called Hudson Bay ) , confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the Pacific .</s>

<s>after three weeks' swift sailing , however , the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas .</s>

<s>the ship halted .</s>

<s>the great sea to the westwards was a dead end .</s>

<s>this must have been Hudson's blackest discovery .</s>

<s>for he seemed to sense at once that before him was no South Sea , but the solid bulk of the North American continent .</s>

<s>this was the bitter end , and Hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure .</s>

<s>feverishly , he tried to brush away this intuition .</s>

<s>north and south , east and west , back and forth he sailed in the land-locked bay , plowing furiously forward until land appeared , then turning to repeat the process , day after day , week after week .</s>

<s>hundreds of miles to the north , the route back to England through the Furious Overfall was again filling with ice .</s>

<s>the men were at first puzzled , then angered by the aimless tacking .</s>

<s>once more , Juet's complaints were the loudest .</s>

<s>Hudson's reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty .</s>

<s>Juet demanded that Hudson prove his charges in an open trial .</s>

<s>the trial was held September 10 .</s>

<s>Hudson , presiding , heard Juet's defense , then called for testimony from crew members .</s>

<s>Juet had made plentiful enemies , several men stepped forward .</s>

<s>hands on Bible , seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins .</s>

<s>cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship .</s>

<s>others added that Juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward .</s>

<s>Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay .</s>

<s>the new mate was Robert Bylot , talented but inexperienced .</s>

<s>there were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves .</s>

<s>the important result , however , was that Juet and Francis Clemens , the deposed boatswain , became Hudson's sworn enemies .</s>

<s>as Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay , every incident lessened the crew's respect for him .</s>

<s>once , after the Discovery lay for a week in rough weather , Hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed .</s>

<s>just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea hit the ship .</s>

<s>Michael Butt and Adame Moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured .</s>

<s>the anchor cable would have been lost overboard , but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe .</s>

<s>Thomas Douglas , fifth Earl of Selkirk , a noble humanitarian Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River of the North .</s>

<s>since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson's Bay Company , he purchased great blocks of the Comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies .</s>

<s>having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers .</s>

<s>the grant , which stretched southward to Lake Traverse -- the headwaters of the Red -- was made in May , 1811 , and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay .</s>

<s>thus at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe , Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier .</s>

<s>seven hundred miles south of York Factory , at the Forks of the Red and the Assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in August 1812 .</s>

<s>by October the little colony about Fort Douglas ( present-day Winnipeg ) numbered 100 .</s>

<s>within a few years the Scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called Meurons .</s>

<s>the latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War of 1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 .</s>

<s>Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire .</s>

<s>the mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 .</s>

<s>it was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward .</s>

<s>when late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the Scots , Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river .</s>

<s>here they built huts and a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland .</s>

<s>the new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food .</s>

<s>the Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by British fur traders .</s>

<s>for many years the Northwest Company had its southern headquarters at Prairie Du Chien on the Mississippi River , some 300 miles southeast of present-day St. Paul , Minnesota .</s>

<s>when in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm out of the United States , its British-born employees , now become American citizens -- Joseph Rolette , Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly -- continued in the fur business .</s>

<s>on Big Stone Lake near the headwaters of the Red River , Robert Dickson , Superintendent of the Western Indian Department of Canada , had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces .</s>

<s>his trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of Red River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south in carts .</s>

<s>these carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days of Alexander Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk colony was begun .</s>

<s>in 1802 Henry referred to our new carts as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as a horse could pack .</s>

<s>they were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills .</s>

<s>it was Dickson who suggested to Lord Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United States .</s>

<s>in September 1817 at Fort Daer ( Pembina ) Dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of Sioux , he escorted to Prairie Du Chien .</s>

<s>during the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England .</s>

<s>upon arriving at Baltimore , Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams , Secretary of State at Washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with Missouri and Illinois Territories .</s>

<s>this traffic , he declared prophetically , tho' it might be of small account at first , would increase with the progress of our Settlements .</s>

<s>the route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected .</s>

<s>in 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at the Forks ( Fort Douglas ) and in December 1819 , twenty men left Fort Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie Du Chien .</s>

<s>it was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on Mackinac boats .</s>

<s>with these completed and ice gone from the St. Peter's River ( present-day Minnesota river ) their 250 bushels of wheat , 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the river to Big Stone Lake , across into Lake Traverse , and down the Red .</s>

<s>they reached Fort Douglas in June 1820 .</s>

<s>this epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk B1 , 040 .</s>

<s>nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food .</s>

<s>thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round .</s>

<s>activity by British traders and the presence of a colony on the Red prompted the United State War Department in 1819 to send Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of Prairie Du Chien , until then the most advanced United States post .</s>

<s>in September 1822 two companies of infantry arrived at the mouth of the St. Peter's River , the head of navigation on the Mississippi , and began construction of Fort St. Anthony which , upon completion , was renamed in honor of its commander , Colonel Josiah Snelling .</s>

<s>it was from the American outposts that Red River shortages of livestock were to be made good .</s>

<s>Hercules L. Dousman , fur trader and merchant at Prairie Du Chien , contracted to supply Selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle , and Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers .</s>

<s>Bailly , after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake Traverse in the Sieux Country and reached Fort Garry , as the Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called , late in the fall .</s>

<s>he set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward the United States .</s>

<s>observing their distressing condition , Colonel Snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation .</s>

<s>as these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota , Dousman of Michilimackinac , Michigan , and Prairie Du Chien was traveling to Red River to open a trade in merchandise .</s>

<s>early in 1822 he was at Fort Garry offering to bring in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco .</s>

<s>Alexander McDonnell , governor of Red River , and James Bird , a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company , ordered such sundry articles to a value of B4 , 500 .</s>

<s>for its part the Hudson's Bay Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement .</s>

<s>as the time drew near for the drawing of the British-American frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the Pembina colony -- its own post and Fort Daer -- was on American territory .</s>

<s>accordingly Selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by October , John Halkett had torn down both posts , floating the timber to the Forks in rafts .</s>

<s>I have done everything , he wrote , to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment .</s>

<s>despite Company threats , duly carried through , to cut off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village .</s>

<s>they would attempt to bring supplies from St. Louis or Prairie Du Chien at great expense as well as danger .</s>

<s>at Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided to cast their lot with the United States , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling .</s>

<s>the disasters of 1825-1826 caused more to leave .</s>

<s>after heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on October 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick .</s>

<s>in April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-June .</s>

<s>on June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip across the plains to the Mississippi .</s>

<s>by fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling , but most of them were sent on to Galena and St. Louis , with a few going as far as Vevay , Indiana , a notable Swiss center in the United States .</s>

<s>in 1837,157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at Fort Snelling .</s>

<s>below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi River .</s>

<s>at the point where they ended , another settlement grew up around a chapel built at the boat landing by Father Lucian Galtier in 1840 .</s>

<s>its people , including Pierre Bottineau and other American Fur Company employees and the refugees from Fort Garry , were joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major Joseph Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840 .</s>

<s>the resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father Galtier's mission , St. Paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained at Red River .</s>

<s>while population at Fort Garry increased rapidly , from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate .</s>

<s>accordingly , though the practice violated the no-trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the Hudson's Bay Company , some settlers went into trade .</s>

<s>the Company maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain from trading in furs .</s>

<s>despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs .</s>

<s>in June 1845 , the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were viewed as aimed at the very vitals of the Company's trade and power .</s>

<s>to reduce further the flow of goods from England , the Company's local officials asked that its London authorities refrain from forwarding any more trade goods to these men .</s>

<s>with their customary source of supply cut off , the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country .</s>

<s>others carried pemmican from the Forks to St. Paul and goods from St. Paul to Red River , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , Wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement .</s>

<s>this trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835 , but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the London committee .</s>

<s>the trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel .</s>

<s>the letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor .</s>

<s>indeed , no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray .</s>

<s>some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive .</s>

<s>a Confederate observed that the Yankees were : thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier .</s>

<s>another reported that his comrades were in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house .</s>

<s>a third wrote that it was raining like poring peas on a rawhide .</s>

<s>Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression .</s>

<s>one wrote : ( I am so hungry ) I could eat a rider off his horse & snap at the stirups .</s>

<s>a second reported that the dilapidated houses in Virginia look like the latter end of original sin and hard times .</s>

<s>a third remarked of slowness of Southerners : they moved about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god .</s>

<s>still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive , wrote : yore letter was short and sweet , jist like a roasted maget .</s>

<s>a Yankee sergeant gave the following description of his sweetheart : my girl is none of your one-horse girls .</s>

<s>she is a regular stub and twister , double geered .</s>

<s>she is well-educated and refined , all wildcat and fur , and Union from the muzzle to the crupper .</s>

<s>humor found many modes of expression .</s>

<s>a Texan wrote to a male companion at home : what has become of Halda and Laura ?</s>

<s>when you see them again give them my love -- not best respects now , but love by God .</s>

<s>William R. Stillwell , an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the Georgia Department of Archives and History , liked to tease his wife in his letters .</s>

<s>the soldiers who comprised the rank and file of the Civil War armies were an earthy people .</s>

<s>one of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea .</s>

<s>men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as looseness of the bowels ;
but a much more common designation was the sh-ts .</s>

<s>a Michigan soldier stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864 :

<s>Johnny Rebs from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering from the the Virginia quickstep .</s>

<s>a Michigan soldier wrote his brother : I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear and I hope thease few lines find you the same .</s>

<s>the letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances .</s>

<s>save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters , soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table .</s>

<s>most of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp , on stumps , pieces of bark , drum heads , or the knee .</s>

<s>in the South , after the first year of the war , paper and ink were very poor .</s>

<s>scarcity of paper caused many Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing , i.e.</s>

<s>, after writing from left to right of the page in the usual manner , they gave the sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously written .</s>

<s>sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads .</s>

<s>I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes , but we take no notice of them now .</s>

the most common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives .</s>

<s>but fathers often addressed communications to their small children ;

<s>Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro community .</s>

<s>occasionally they would write to the slaves .</s>

<s>early in the war it was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp Negro body servants to perform the menial chores such as cooking , foraging , cleaning the quarters , shining shoes , and laundering clothes .</s>

<s>sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members of their owners' families .</s>

<s>unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with sweethearts at home .</s>

<s>owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19th-century America , these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling .</s>

<s>occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in Richmond , Petersburg , Washington , or Nashville .</s>

<s>but these comments are hardly printable .</s>

<s>an Alabama soldier whose feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully of his achievements among the Virginia belles : they thout I was a saint .</s>

<s>I told them some sweet lies and they believed it all .</s>

<s>I would tell them I got a letter from home stating that five of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappy's .</s>

<s>but I wold say I recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk .</s>

<s>they brok & run and Arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches and we all let go at them .</s>

<s>thay may say what they please but godamit Pa it is fun .</s>

<s>some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers .</s>

<s>a Mississippi soldier wrote : our General Reub Davis is a vain , stuck-up , illiterate ass .</s>

<s>an Alabamian wrote : Col. Henry is ( an ignoramus ) fit for nothing higher than the cultivation of corn .</s>

<s>Jackson runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow their leader .</s>

<s>he is not worth shucks .</s>

<s>but he is a West Point graduate and therefore must be born to command .</s>

<s>similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers .</s>

<s>a Massachusetts soldier , who seems to have been a Civil War version of Bill Mauldin , wrote : the officers consider themselves as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks .</s>

<s>Private George Gray Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote : I am well convinced in my own mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended long ago .</s>

<s>another Yankee became so disgusted as to state : I wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against ( the other half ) .</s>

<s>one Federal soldier wrote : the docters is no aconte -- hell will be filde with do(c)ters and offersey when this war is over .</s>

<s>shortly after the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign , an ailing Yank wrote his homefolk : the surgeon insisted on sending me to the hospital for treatment .</s>

<s>I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed -- thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than ( by ) Union quackery .</s>

<s>the attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling , from friendliness to extreme hatred .</s>

<s>the popularity of folklore in America stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in America .</s>

<s>and the emphasis on nationalism in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence across the world .</s>

<s>thus , if we are to observe American folklore in the twentieth century , we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore , nationalism and imperialism at the outset .</s>

<s>historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence .</s>

<s>1 ) every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been , creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions .</s>

<s>what actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred .</s>

<s>2 ) as a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness .</s>

<s>its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account for group actions , to provide a focal point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification .</s>

<s>one can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United States in more recent years .</s>

<s>the popularity of local color literature before the Spanish-American War , the steady currency of the Lincoln myth , the increased emphasis on the frontier West in our mass media are cases in point .</s>

<s>nor is it an accident that baseball , growing into the national game in the last 75 years , has become a microcosm of American life , that learned societies such as the American Folklore Society and the American Historical Association were founded in the 1880s , or that courses in American literature , American civilization , American anything have swept our school and college curricula .</s>

<s>of course , nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours , and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth-century United States .</s>

<s>yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man in the street .</s>

<s>it is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine .</s>

<s>after all , the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal , economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control .</s>

<s>anyone's identification with an international struggle , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement .</s>

<s>such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes .</s>

<s>in America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose .</s>

<s>a heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land .</s>

<s>but we must never forget , most of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight , to answer immediate needs , almost always with conscious aims and ends .</s>

<s>Parson Weems's George Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of the uniting States .</s>

<s>Abraham Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national Constitution .</s>

<s>Robert E. Lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy .</s>

<s>and their roles are paralleled by those of Patrick Henry , Nathan Hale , Andrew Jackson , Davy Crockett , Theodore Roosevelt and many , many more .</s>

<s>therefore , the scholar , as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years , will be mindful of two facts .</s>

<s>1 ) most of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at all .</s>

<s>2 ) the concept that an American national folklore exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend .</s>

<s>folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission .</s>

<s>it has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression .</s>

<s>related to written literature , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form , it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence .</s>

<s>though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter .</s>

<s>in its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this .</s>

<s>enthusiastically , Americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul Bunyan tales , Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition .</s>

<s>nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi-isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material .</s>

<s>naturally , such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore .</s>

<s>that much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant .</s>

<s>as long as his material is Americana , can in some way be ascribed to the masses and appears democratic to his audience , he remains satisfied .</s>

<s>from all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth-century American folklore .</s>

<s>on the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make up this nation .</s>

<s>on the other we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , frontier western or colonial material willy-nilly .</s>

<s>unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways .</s>

<s>after all , the field is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates .</s>

<s>in addition , this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly , in an age of print and easy communication , within an ever-expanding and changing society .</s>

<s>the problems confuse even the experts .</s>

<s>for that matter , the experts themselves are a mixed breed .</s>

<s>anthropologists , housewives , historians and such by profession , they approach their discipline as amateurs , collectors , commercial propagandists , analysts or some combination of the four .</s>

<s>they have widely varying backgrounds and aims .</s>

<s>they have little esprit de corps .</s>

<s>the outlook for the amateur , for instance , is usually dependent on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque .</s>

<s>his love of folklore has romanticism in it , and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote .</s>

<s>folklore is his hobby , and he , all too rightly , wishes it to remain as such .</s>

<s>the amateur is closely related to the collector , who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field .</s>

<s>the collector enjoys the contact with rural life ;
he hunts folklore for the very field and stream reasons that many persons hunt game ;
and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located .</s>

<s>fundamentally , both these types , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material .</s>

<s>but there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts -- one dominated by money , the other by nineteenth-century German scholarship .</s>

<s>both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found .</s>

<s>both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines .</s>

<s>the commercial propagandist , who can't afford to be critical , gets along well with the amateur , from whom he feeds , but he frequently steps on the analyst's toes by refusing to keep his material genuine .</s>

<s>his standards are , of course , completely foreign to those of the analyst .</s>

<s>to both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications .</s>

<s>dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system , the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups , although he cannot deny his debt to the collector .</s>

<s>the knowledge that most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors .</s>

<s>the work done by the analysts , the men who really know what folklore is all about , has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited , learned audience .</s>

<s>publishers want books that will sell , recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music , grade and high schools want quaint , but moral , material .</s>

<s>the analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in .</s>

<s>as a result , most people don't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is ;
they see it as a potpourri of charming , moral legends and patriotic anecdotes , with a superstition or remedy thrown in here and there .</s>

<s>and so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the United States survive on sentiment and nationalism alone .</s>

<s>if one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American public .</s>

<s>and while every writer must be dealt with as a special case , the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each .</s>

<s>does the writer know the difference between an ersatz ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk ?</s>

<s>when the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure ?</s>

<s>is the writer propagandistic ?</s>

<s>is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America that was ?</s>

<s>or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of American attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be ?</s>

<s>when he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged .</s>

<s>in the first place , a good many writers who are said to use folklore , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale .</s>

<s>Robert Frost , for instance , writes about rural life in New England , but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems .</s>

<s>this has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a folk poet , simply because he is a rural one .</s>

<s>in the second place , a large number of writers , making a more direct claim than Frost to being folk writers of one sort or another , clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material .</s>

<s>Stephen Vincent Benet's John Brown's Body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath and Carl Sandburg's The People , Yes .</s>

<s>the last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works , and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon , see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass .</s>

<s>folklore , as used by such writers , really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it .</s>

<s>the folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to nation or political attitude .</s>

<s>in fact , there is much evidence to indicate they don't care a bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational limits .</s>

<s>nevertheless , with a reading public that longs for the good old days and with an awareness of our expanding international interests , it is easy for the Benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of Americana , real or fake , and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk .</s>

<s>as part of the same arrangement , Torrio had , in the spirit of peace and good will , and in exchange for armed support in the April election campaign , bestowed upon O'Banion a third share in the Hawthorne Smoke Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade .</s>

<s>the coalition was to prove inadvisable .</s>

<s>O'Banion was a complex and frightening man , whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour into others' .</s>

<s>he had a round , frank Irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone's body .</s>

<s>he carried three guns -- one in the right trouser pocket , one under his left armpit , one in the left outside coat pocket -- and was equally lethal with both hands .</s>

<s>he killed accurately , freely , and dispassionately .</s>

<s>the police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them .</s>

<s>like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol .</s>

<s>he was an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths .</s>

<s>he had no apparent comprehension of morality ;
he divided humanity into right guys and wrong guys , and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under .</s>

<s>he had what was described by a psychologist as a sunny brutality .</s>

<s>he walked with a heavy list to the right , as that leg was four inches shorter than the other , but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns .</s>

<s>Landesco thought him just a superior sort of plugugly but he was , in fact , with his aggression and hostility , and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain , a casebook psychopath .</s>

<s>he was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as Torrio and Capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld , the roughneck king .</s>

<s>O'Banion was born in poverty , the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer , in the North Side's Little Hell , close by the Sicilian quarter and Death Corner .</s>

<s>he had been a choir boy at the Holy Name Cathedral and also served as an acolyte to Father O'Brien .</s>

<s>the influence of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy houses , honkytonks , and sawdust saloons of his birthplace ;
he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood , and went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving , police-dodging , and housebreaking .</s>

<s>at the age of ten , when he was working as a newsboy in the Loop , he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg .</s>

<s>because of this he was known as Gimpy ( but , as with Capone and his nickname of Scarface , never in his presence ) .</s>

<s>in his teens O'Banion was enrolled in the vicious Market Street gang and he became a singing waiter in McGovern's Cafe , a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North Clark Street , where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown out .</s>

<s>he then got a job with the Chicago Herald-Examiner as a circulation slugger , a rough fighter employed to see that his paper's news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors .</s>

<s>he was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman , and learning how to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene Geary , later committed to Chester Asylum as a homicidal maniac , but whose eyes misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor .</s>

<s>O'Banion's first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell Prison for three months for burglary ;
two years later he served another three months for assault .</s>

<s>those were his only interludes behind bars , although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary and one for robbery .</s>

<s>but by now O'Banion's political pull was beginning to be effective .</s>

<s>on the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10,000 bond was furnished by an alderman , and the charge was nolle prossed .</s>

<s>on one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a Detective Sergeant John J. Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the Postal Telegraph Building ;
the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted , at a cost of $30,000 in bribes , it was estimated .</s>

<s>as promptly as Torrio , O'Banion jumped into bootlegging .</s>

<s>he conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the Sicilians , but he had his huge North Side portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money .</s>

<s>unlike the Sicilians , he additionally conducted holdups , robberies , and safe-cracking expeditions , and refused to touch prostitution .</s>

<s>he was also personally active in ward politics , and by 1924 O'Banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state : I always deliver my borough as per requirements .</s>

<s>but whose requirements ?</s>

<s>until 1924 O'Banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his North Side domain solidly Democratic .</s>

<s>there was a question-and-answer gag that went around at that time : Q. who'll carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards ?</s>

<s>A. O'Banion , in his pistol pocket .</s>

<s>but as November 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O'Banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans .</s>

<s>to forestall any change of allegiance , the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O'Banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay .</s>

<s>the reception was held in a private dining room of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West .</s>

<s>it was an interesting fraternisation of ex-convicts , union racketeers , ward heelers , sold-out officials , and gunmen .</s>

<s>the guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time .</s>

<s>it included the top O'Banion men and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes .</s>

<s>when Mayor Dever heard of the banquet he summoned Hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department by consorting with these felons and fixers .</s>

<s>Hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry O'Connor , the proprieter of a Loop gambling house .</s>

<s>but when I arrived and recognised a number of notorious characters I had thrown into the detective bureau basement half a dozen times , I knew I had been framed , and withdrew almost at once .</s>

<s>in fact , O'Connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin .</s>

<s>there was a brief interruption while one of O'Banion's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip .</s>

<s>then O'Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds .</s>

<s>this dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley , had been maintained with more or less stealth , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings , denounced by a clergyman as Belshazzar feasts , at which politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters , openly , in the big downtown hotels .</s>

<s>Pasley continued : they became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928-29 .</s>

<s>however , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever .</s>

<s>O'Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal .</s>

<s>on Election Day -- November 4 -- he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes .</s>

<s>the result was a landslide for the Republican candidates .</s>

<s>this further demonstration of O'Banion's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone .</s>

<s>in the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking .</s>

<s>he behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine Latin minds , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness .</s>

<s>they were disturbed by his idiotic bravado -- as , when his bodyguard , Yankee Schwartz , complained that he had been snubbed by Dave Miller , a prize-fight referee , chieftain of a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were Hirschey , a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with Torrio and O'Banion , Frank , a policeman , and Max , the youngest .</s>

<s>to settle this slight , O'Banion went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop , where , he had learned , Dave Miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy .</s>

<s>at the end of the performance , Dave and Max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters .</s>

<s>O'Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave , severely wounding him in the stomach .</s>

<s>a second bullet ricocheted off Max's belt buckle , leaving him unhurt but in some distress .</s>

<s>O'Banion tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre ;
he was neither prosecuted nor even arrested .</s>

<s>that sort of braggadocio , for that sort of reason , in the view of Torrio and Capone , was a nonsense .</s>

<s>a further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held up a Torrio beer convoy on a West Side street and demanded $300 to let it through .</s>

<s>one of the beer-runners telephoned O'Banion -- on a line tapped by the detective bureau -- and reported the situation .</s>

<s>O'Banion's reaction was : three hundred dollars ]
to them bums ?</s>

<s>why , I can get them knocked off for half that much .</s>

<s>upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if O'Banion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen .</s>

<s>but in the meantime the beer-runner , unhappy with this solution , telephoned Torrio and returned to O'Banion with the message : say , Dionie , I just been talking to Johnny , and he said to let them cops have the three hundred .</s>

<s>he says he don't want no trouble .</s>

<s>but Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman .</s>

<s>for three years , since the liquor territorial conference , Torrio had , with his elastic patience , and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business , tolerated O'Banion's impudent double-crossing .</s>

<s>they had suffered , in sulky silence , the sight of his sharp practice in Cicero .</s>

<s>when , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election , Torrio had given O'Banion a slice of Cicero , the profits from that district had been $20,000 a month .</s>

<s>in six months O'Banion had boosted the profits to $100,000 a month -- mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb .</s>

<s>these booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon , Saltis-McErlane , and Druggan-Lake gangs , and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons ;
once again O'Banion's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will .</s>

<s>the revenue from O'Banion's Cicero territory went up still higher , until the yield was more than the Torrio-Capone takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago's South and West Sides .</s>

<s>but he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate .</s>

<s>at last , even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that O'Banion should take a percentage in the Stickney brothels in return for one from his Cicero beer concession .</s>

<s>O'Banion's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal .</s>

<s>still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the O'Banion gang's seizure from a West Side marshalling yard of a freight-car load of Canadian whisky worth $100,000 and by one of the biggest coups of the Prohibition era -- the Sibley warehouse robbery , which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation .</s>

<s>here was stored $1,000,000 worth of bonded whisky .</s>

<s>a tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide , an earthquake or a volcanic eruption .</s>

<s>the most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of Krakatoa in 1883 ;
it raced across the Pacific at 300 miles an hour , devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high , and pounded the shore as far away as San Francisco .</s>

<s>the ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves .</s>

<s>whether or not Plato's tale of the lost continent of Atlantis is true , skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times .</s>

<s>indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood .</s>

<s>one of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 1 , 1755 ;
its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the English coast .</s>

<s>tsunami are rare , however , in the Atlantic Ocean ;
they are far more common in the Pacific .</s>

<s>Japan has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 .</s>

<s>the Hawaiian Islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years .</s>

<s>in 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the Inland Sea ;
one wave swamped more than 1,000 ships and boats in Osaka Bay .</s>

<s>a tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869 washed away an entire town ( Ponoluu ) , leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been .</s>

<s>in 1896 a Japanese tsunami killed 27,000 people and swept away 10,000 homes .</s>

<s>the dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement .</s>

<s>an ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest -- no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1,000 feet in the Pacific .</s>

<s>but a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest .</s>

<s>while a wind wave never travels at more than 60 miles per hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour .</s>

<s>the greater the depth of the water , the greater is the speed of the wave ;
Lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity .</s>

<s>in the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles per hour .</s>

<s>tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable .</s>

<s>their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest .</s>

<s>usually it is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to their terrifying heights .</s>

<s>on the fateful day in 1896 when the great waves approached Japan , fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells .</s>

<s>not until they sailed home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses , were they aware of what had happened .</s>

<s>the seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers , drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore .</s>

<s>the giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones .</s>

<s>they usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height , but when they pour into a J inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions .</s>

<s>generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell , not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers .</s>

<s>this is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrives .</s>

<s>reefs are left high and dry , and the beaches are covered with stranded fish .</s>

<s>at Hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach .</s>

<s>many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives , for some minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore .</s>

<s>after an earthquake in Japan in 1793 people on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground .</s>

<s>when a second quake came , they dashed back to the beach , fearing that they might be buried under landslides .</s>

<s>just as they reached the shore , the first huge wave crashed upon them .</s>

<s>a tsunami is not a single wave but a series .</s>

<s>the waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ) , and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over .</s>

<s>the waves may keep coming for many hours .</s>

<s>usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest .</s>

<s>among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo was Francis P. Shepard of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , one of the world's foremost marine geologists .</s>

<s>he was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves .</s>

<s>their onrush and retreat , he reported , was accompanied by a great hissing , roaring and rattling .</s>

<s>the third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest .</s>

<s>on some of the islands' beaches the waves came in gently ;
they were steepest on the shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come .</s>

<s>in Hilo Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high .</s>

<s>the highest waves , 55 feet , occurred at Pololu Valley .</s>

<s>scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon .</s>

<s>during a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night .</s>

<s>the luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism Noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea .</s>

<s>Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs ;
the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms , raised to the surface by the disturbance .</s>

<s>the waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3,000 feet .</s>

<s>gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands .</s>

<s>the tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by Commander C. K. Green of the Coast and Geodetic Survey staff .</s>

<s>it consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface .</s>

<s>ordinary water tides are disregarded .</s>

<s>but when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean , they set in motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit .</s>

<s>this in turn sets off an alarm , notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress .</s>

<s>such equipment has been installed at Hilo , Midway , Attu and Dutch Harbor .</s>

<s>the moment the alarm goes off , information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu , which is the center of the warning system .</s>

<s>this center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast Survey stations in the Pacific which are equipped with seismographs .</s>

<s>its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami .</s>

<s>by means of charts showing wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the Pacific .</s>

<s>the civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger , and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps .</s>

<s>all of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly .</s>

<s>since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific , but only one was of any consequence .</s>

<s>on November 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula .</s>

<s>at 17:07 that afternoon ( Greenwich time ) the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu .</s>

<s>the warning system immediately went into action .</s>

<s>within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in Alaska , Arizona and California , the quake's epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude .</s>

<s>while accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the Pacific ( Midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the Hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time .</s>

<s>it turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 .</s>

<s>they hurled a cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu Harbor , knocked down telephone lines , marooned automobiles , flooded lawns , killed six cows .</s>

<s>but not a single human life was lost , and property damage in the Hawaiian Islands did not exceed $800,000 .</s>

<s>there is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage .</s>

<s>but it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough .</s>

<s>in the vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts , or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves .</s>

<s>the key to the world of geology is change ;
nothing remains the same .</s>

<s>life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man .</s>

<s>the land , too , is changing , and earthquakes are daily reminders of this .</s>

<s>earthquakes result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break .</s>

<s>sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface ;
often the shifts cannot be seen , but they are there ;
and everywhere can be found scars of earlier breaks once deeply buried .</s>

<s>today's earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated , but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them .</s>

<s>the effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized , even overemphasized .</s>

<s>the role of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously frightening , but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster .</s>

<s>superstition has often blended with fact to color reports .</s>

<s>we have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earth's interior , for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled .</s>

<s>these waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins , and that it , in turn , has a solid inner core .</s>

<s>earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface , but they do not occur at greater depths .</s>

<s>two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts .</s>

<s>( 1 ) as far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks do .</s>

<s>( 2 ) if earthquakes do occur at such depths , why not deeper ?</s>

<s>knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields .</s>

<s>in the search for oil and gas , we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources .</s>

<s>we have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate .</s>

<s>the following discussion of this subject has been adapted from the book Causes Of Catastrophe by L. Don Leet .</s>

<s>the restless earth and its interior
at twelve minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday , April 18 , 1906 , San Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake .</s>

<s>a sharp tremor was followed by a jerky roll .</s>

<s>in Ireland's County Limerick , near the River Shannon , there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen , which means Garden of Owen .</s>

<s>undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on American military history , or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name .</s>

<s>the cry Garryowen ]
bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes , Sioux and Apaches , Mexican banditos under Pancho Villa , Japanese in the South Pacific , and Chinese and North Korean Communists in Korea .</s>

<s>Garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment , The Fighting Seventh .</s>

<s>today a battle cry may seem an anachronism , for in the modern Army , esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables .</s>

<s>but don't tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh , especially in a saloon on Saturday night .</s>

<s>of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7th Cav , perhaps no one knows its spirit better than Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C. Chandler .</s>

<s>wiry and burr-headed , with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals , Chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper .</s>

<s>the truth is , however , that when Mel Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil .</s>

<s>Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical Service Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas City Medical Depot when he decided that if he was going to make the Army his career , he wanted to be in the fighting part of it .</s>

<s>though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces .</s>

<s>the next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer of Troop J , 7th Cavalry , in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan .</s>

<s>outside of combat , he couldn't have landed in a tougher spot .</s>

<s>first of all , no unit likes to have a new J brought in from the outside , especially when he's an armchair trooper .</s>

<s>second , if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him , it's on maneuvers .</s>

<s>in combat , helping your J make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed .</s>

<s>but in maneuvers , with the top brass watching him all the time , it's easy .</s>

<s>Chandler understood this and expected the worst .</s>

<s>but his first few days with Troop J were full of surprises , beginning with First Sergeant Robert Early .</s>

<s>Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice .</s>

<s>instead Sergeant Early was quiet , sharp and confident .</s>

<s>he had enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade .</s>

<s>there was no weapon Early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded .</s>

<s>he could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work .</s>

<s>further , he had taken full advantage of the Army's correspondence courses .</s>

<s>he not only knew soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as well .</s>

<s>but for all his erudite confidence , Sergeant Early was right out of the Garryowen mold .</s>

<s>he was filled with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh .</s>

<s>that saved Mel Chandler .</s>

<s>Sergeant Early let the new J know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the United States Army .</s>

<s>he fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment .</s>

<s>for example , it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the Battle of The Little Big Horn .</s>

<s>it didn't take Captain Chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of Troop J .</s>

<s>but what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer , non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it , for the good of the troop and the regiment .</s>

<s>maneuvers over , the 7th returned to garrison duty in Tokyo , Captain Chandler still with them .</s>

<s>it was the 7th Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial Palace of the Emperor .</s>

<s>but still Mel Chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word , Garryowen .</s>

<s>the final proof was a small incident .</s>

<s>it happened at the St. Patrick's Day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains of an Irish march .</s>

<s>in the middle of the party Chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him , each beaming above the biggest , greenest shamrock he had ever seen .</s>

<s>the faces belonged to Lieutenant Marvin Goulding , his wife and their two children .</s>

<s>and when the singing began , it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish songs the best .</s>

<s>though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle about Marvin Goulding , the Jewish officer from Chicago , singing tearfully about the ould sod , no one really thought it was strange .</s>

<s>for Marvin Goulding , like Giovanni Martini , the bugler boy who carried Custer's last message , or Margarito Lopez , the one-man Army on Leyte , was a Garryowen , through and through .</s>

<s>it was no coincidence that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment .</s>

<s>and so Mel Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen .</s>

<s>he set out to keep Troop J the best troop in the best regiment .</s>

<s>one of his innovations was to see to it that every man -- cook and clerk as well as rifleman -- qualified with every weapon in the troop .</s>

<s>even the mess sergeant , Bill Brown , a dapper , cocky transfer from an airborne division , went out on the range .</s>

<s>the troop received a new leader , Lieutenant Robert M. Carroll , fresh out of J and bucking for Regular Army status .</s>

<s>Carroll was sharp and military , but he was up against tough competition for that J berth , and he wanted to play it cool .</s>

<s>so Mel Chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of Garryowen , just as he himself had been sold a short time before .</s>

<s>when the Korean war began , on June 25 , 1950 , the anniversary of the day Custer had gone down fighting at the Little Big Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of Leyte during World War 2 , the 7th Cavalry was not in the best fighting condition .</s>

<s>its entire complement of non-commissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit , and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World War 2 .</s>

<s>just a month after the Korean War broke out , the 7th Cavalry was moving into the lines , ready for combat .</s>

<s>from then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in Korea .</s>

<s>one night on the Naktong River , Mel Chandler called on that fabled esprit de corps .</s>

<s>the regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the North Koreans were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side .</s>

<s>the troopers knew an attack was coming , but they didn't know when , and they didn't know where .</s>

<s>at 6 o'clock on the morning of August 12 , they were in doubt no longer .</s>

<s>then it came , against Troop J .</s>

<s>the enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men , armed with Russian machine guns , attacked the position held by Chandler's men .</s>

<s>they came in waves .</s>

<s>first came the cannon fodder , white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering ram .</s>

<s>they were followed by crack North Korean troops , who mounted one charge after another .</s>

<s>they overran the 7th Cav's forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers , over piles of their own dead .</s>

<s>another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear .</s>

<s>Captain Chandler saw that it was building up strength .</s>

<s>he assembled a group of 25 men , composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation , the company clerk , supply men , cooks and drivers , and led them to the hill .</s>

<s>one of the more seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll , the young officer bucking for the Regular Army .</s>

<s>Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight .</s>

<s>then Mel Chandler started up the hill .</s>

<s>he took one step , two , broke into a trot and then into a run .</s>

<s>the first thing he knew the words Garryowen ]
burst from his throat .</s>

<s>his followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill , firing as they ran .</s>

<s>the Koreans fell back , but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire .</s>

<s>Chandler , looking to right and left to see how his men were faring , suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill , hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry as he ran .</s>

<s>it was Bob Carroll , who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of Garryowen .</s>

<s>he had formed his own task force of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a Fighting Seventh charge .</s>

<s>because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again .</s>

<s>but an enemy grenade hit Carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously .</s>

<s>he went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire .</s>

<s>enemy reinforcements came pouring down , seeking a soft spot .</s>

<s>they found it at the junction between Troops J and J , and prepared to counterattack .</s>

<s>Marvin Goulding saw what was happening .</s>

<s>he turned to his platoon .</s>

<s>okay , men , he said .</s>

<s>follow me .</s>

<s>Goulding leaped to his feet and started forward , Garryowen ]
on his lips , his men following .</s>

<s>but the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding fell dead .</s>

<s>for an instant his men hesitated , unable to believe that their lieutenant , the most popular officer in the regiment , was dead .</s>

<s>then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and , cursing , screaming and hollering Garryowen ]
they charged into the enemy like wild men .</s>

<s>that finished the job that Captain Chandler and Lieutenant Carroll had begun .</s>

<s>Goulding's platoon pushed back the enemy soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack .</s>

<s>reinforcements came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding's platoon .</s>

<s>the North Koreans threw away their guns and fled across the rice paddies .</s>

<s>artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds .</s>

<s>though Bob Carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade , he lived .</s>

<s>today he is a major -- in the Regular Army .</s>

<s>so filled was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was over , he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment .</s>

<s>after years of digging , nights and weekends , he put together the big , profusely illustrated book , Of Garryowen And Glory , which is probably the most complete history of any military unit .</s>

<s>the battle of the Naktong River is just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of The Fighting Seventh have paid off .</s>

<s>for nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment .</s>

<s>take the case of Major Marcus A. Reno , who survived the Battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876 .</s>

<s>from the enlisted men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape , a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus Reno .</s>

<s>many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him .</s>

<s>but when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice made against him , the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the Sioux , refused to say a harsh word against him .</s>

<s>he was a member of The Fighting Seventh .</s>

<s>although it was at the Battle of The Little Horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in American history , that the 7th Cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then .</s>

<s>Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer was the regiment's first permanent commander and , like such generals as George S. Patton and Terry De La Mesa Allen in their rise to military prominence , Custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare .</s>

<s>during the Civil War , Custer , who achieved a brilliant record , was made brigadier general at the age of 23 .</s>

<s>he finished the war as a major general , commanding a full division , and at 25 was the youngest major general in the history of the U.S. Army .</s>

<s>I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident , in the sense that everyone agrees with them .</s>

<s>if they were , Walter Lippmann would be writing the same columns as George Sokolsky , and Herb Lock would have nothing to draw cartoons about .</s>

<s>I do mean , however , that I take them for granted , and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions .</s>

<s>assumption 1 .</s>

<s>the ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity ;
and in particular -- since this is our special responsibility -- that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United States .</s>

<s>I speak of the largest possible measure because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved -- ever -- reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings , and is therefore a dangerous man to have around .</s>

<s>assumption 2 .</s>

<s>these conditions are unobtainable -- are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated -- without the prior defeat of world Communism .</s>

<s>this is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally , and in practice , antithetical to these conditions ;
and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization .</s>

<s>moreover , as Communist power increases , the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote .</s>

<s>assumption 3 .</s>

<s>it follows that victory over Communism is the dominant , proximate goal of American policy .</s>

<s>proximate in the sense that there are more distant , more positive ends we seek , to which victory over Communism is but a means .</s>

<s>but dominant in the sense that every other objective , no matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it .</s>

<s>peace is a worthy objective ;
but if we must choose between peace and keeping the Communists out of Berlin , then we must fight .</s>

<s>freedom , in the sense of self-determination , is a worthy objective ;
but if granting self-determination to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-Soviet orbit , then Algerian freedom must be postponed .</s>

<s>justice is a worthy objective ;
but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union of South Africa away from the West , then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer .</s>

<s>prosperity is a worthy objective ;
but if providing higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made .</s>

<s>it may be , of course , that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism ;
my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world -- the absence of Soviet Communist power .</s>

<s>the uses of power
this much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do -- defeat Communism -- and , if so , how those resources ought to be used .</s>

<s>this brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power .</s>

<s>I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be .</s>

<s>and I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers , ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945 , to deal with this problem realistically and seriously .</s>

<s>in the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus .</s>

<s>one was demonstrably false ;
the other , for the most part , true .</s>

<s>the first was that America had become -- or was in danger of becoming -- a second-rate military power .</s>

<s>I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention .</s>

<s>you may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment -- I certainly do -- but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States not only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U.S.-Soviet relations for the foreseeable future .</s>

<s>I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts , and I think Mr. Jameson Campaigne has done it well in his new book American Might And Soviet Myth .</s>

<s>suppose , he says , that the tables were turned , and we were in the Soviets' position : there would be more than 2,000 modern Soviet fighters , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases in Mexico and the Caribbean .</s>

<s>overwhelming Russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast .</s>

<s>half of the population of the U.S. would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people .</s>

<s>add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity .</s>

<s>add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength .</s>

<s>if we look at the situation this way , we can get an idea of Khrushchev's nightmarish worries -- or , at least , of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage .</s>

<s>U.S. prestige
the other charge was that America's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years .</s>

<s>the contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign , but once that has been done , I fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it .</s>

<s>the argument was typically advanced in terms of U.S. prestige .</s>

<s>prestige , however , is only a minor part of the problem ;
and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading .</s>

<s>prestige is a measure of how other people think of you , well or ill .</s>

<s>but contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake .</s>

<s>only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be .</s>

<s>the thing to lose sleep over is what people , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it .</s>

<s>the evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead .</s>

<s>this ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ;
but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do -- namely , by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side .</s>

<s>to the extent , then , that declining U.S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern .</s>

<s>still , these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the Soviet Union and ourselves .</s>

<s>here I do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power -- of influence , if you will -- about which the relevant questions are : is Soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago ?</s>

<s>and is Western influence greater or less than it used to be ?</s>

<s>Communist gains
in answering these questions , we need to ask not merely whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded : the success of Communism's war against the West does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests .</s>

<s>success may mean merely the displacement of Western influence .</s>

<s>Communist political warfare , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages .</s>

<s>fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win , the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the United Nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level .</s>

<s>the Soviets understand , moreover , that the first step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West .</s>

<s>thus , typically , the first stage of a Communist takeover is to neutralize a country .</s>

<s>the second stage is to retain the nominal classification of neutralist , while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy .</s>

<s>and this may be as far as the process will go .</s>

<s>the Kremlin's goal is the isolation and capture , not of Ghana , but of the United States -- and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a neutralist mask , yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries of the Soviet Foreign Office .</s>

<s>to recite the particulars of recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring .</s>

<s>six years ago French Indochina , though in troubie , was in the Western camp .</s>

<s>today Northern Vietnam is overtly Communist ;
Laos is teetering between Communism and pro-Communist neutralism ;
Cambodia is , for all practical purposes , neutralist .</s>

<s>Indonesia , in the early days of the Republic , leaned toward the West .</s>

<s>today Sukarno's government is heavily besieged by avowed Communists , and for all of its neutralist pretensions , it is a firm ally of Soviet policy .</s>

<s>Ceylon has moved from a pro-Western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the West .</s>

<s>in the Middle East , Iraq , Syria and Egypt were , a short while ago , in the Western camp .</s>

<s>today the Nasser and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West , are dependent for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel ;
in almost every particular follow the Kremlin's foreign policy line .</s>

<s>a short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve .</s>

<s>never mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination : the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the West .</s>

<s>today , Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging , it would seem , into the Soviet orbit .</s>

<s>Latin America was once an area as safe for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon .</s>

<s>today it is up for grabs .</s>

<s>one Latin American country , Cuba , has become a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast .</s>

<s>in some countries the trend has gone further than others : Mexico , Panama , and Venezuela are displaying open sympathy for Castroism , and there is no country -- save the Dominican Republic whose funeral services we recently arranged -- where Castroism and Anti-Americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause .</s>

<s>only in Europe have our lines remained firm -- and there only on the surface .</s>

<s>the strains of neutralism are running strong , notably in England , and even in Germany .</s>

<s>opportunities missed
what have we to show by way of counter-successes ?</s>

<s>we have had opportunities -- clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the Iron Curtain .</s>

<s>there was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised and mourned , but did nothing about .</s>

<s>there was the Polish Revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to Soviet interests .</s>

<s>there was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended did not exist .</s>

<s>only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power : in Guatemala .</s>

<s>and contrary to what has been said recently , we did not wait for outside pressures and world opinion to bring down that Communist government ;
we moved decisively to effect an Anti-Communist coup d'etat .</s>

<s>we served our national interests , and by so doing we saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery .</s>

<s>the first rattle of the machine guns , at 7:10 in the evening , roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear .</s>

<s>sounds exactly like last time .</s>

<s>the young man spoke steadily enough , but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven .</s>

<s>the middle-aged man said over and over , why did I come here , why did I come here .</s>

<s>then he was sick .</s>

<s>amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons , I heard the thumping of mortars .</s>

<s>then the lights went out .</s>

<s>this was my second day in Vientiane , the administrative capital of Laos , and my thoughts were none too brave .</s>

<s>where was my flashlight ?</s>

<s>where should I go ?</s>

<s>to my room ?</s>

<s>better stay in the hotel lobby , where the walls looked good and thick .</s>

<s>Chinese and Indian merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters .</s>

<s>hotel attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby .</s>

<s>a woman with a small boy slipped in between them .</s>

<s>please , she said , please .</s>

<s>she held out her hand to show that she had money .</s>

<s>the American newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office .</s>

<s>but what was the story ?</s>

<s>had the Communist-led Pathet Lao finally come this far ?</s>

<s>or was it another revolt inside Vientiane ?</s>

<s>let's play hero , I said .</s>

<s>let's go to the roof and see .</s>

<s>gunfire saves the moon
by 7:50 the answer was plain .</s>

<s>there had been an eclipse of the moon .</s>

<s>a traditional Lao explanation is that the moon was being swallowed by a toad , and the remedy was to make all possible noise , ideally with firearms .</s>

<s>the din was successful , too , for just before the moon disappeared , the frightened toad had begun to spit it out again , which meant good luck all around .</s>

<s>how quaint it all seemed the next day .</s>

<s>a restaurant posted a reminder to patrons who became excited and left without paying their checks .</s>

<s>but everyone I met had sought cover first and asked questions later .</s>

<s>and no wonder , for Vientiane , the old City of Sandalwood , had become the City of Bullet Holes .</s>

<s>I saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets .</s>

<s>along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered .</s>

<s>in place of the police headquarters was a new square filled with rubble .</s>

<s>mortars had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next door .</s>

<s>what had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick .</s>

<s>this damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane , fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( December 9-11 , 1960 ) .</s>

<s>and now , in March , all Laos suffered a state of siege .</s>

<s>the Pathet Lao forces held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more .</s>

<s>throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death .</s>

<s>and it's all the more tragic because it's so little deserved , said Mr. J. J.</s>

<s>A. Frans , a Belgian official of the United Nations Educational , Scientific , and Cultural Organization .</s>

<s>we talked after I hailed his Jeep marked with the U.N. flag .</s>

<s>practically all the people of Laos , he explained -- about two million of them -- are rice farmers , and the means and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel plows .</s>

<s>they look after their fields and children and water buffaloes in ten or eleven thousand villages , with an average of 200 souls .</s>

<s>nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are .</s>

<s>they spread over an area no larger than Oregon ;
yet they include peoples as different from one another as Oregonians are from Patagonians .</s>

<s>life must be kept in harmony .</s>

<s>what matters here is family loyalty ;
faith in the Buddha and staying at peace with the phis , the spirits ;
and to live in harmony with nature .</s>

<s>harmony in Laos ?</s>

<s>precisely , said Mr. Frans .</s>

<s>he spoke of the season of dryness and dust , brought by the monsoon from the northeast , in harmony with the season of rain and mud , brought by the monsoon from the southwest .</s>

<s>the slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering Mekong River .</s>

<s>shy , slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with the frangipani by the wayside .</s>

<s>even life in harmony with death .</s>

<s>for so long as death was not violent , it was natural and to be welcomed , making a funeral a feast .</s>

<s>to many a Frenchman -- they came 95 years ago , colonized , and stayed until Laos became independent in 1953 -- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than Tahiti .</s>

<s>yet Laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen around the globe .</s>

<s>the Pathet Lao , stiffened by Communist Veterans from neighboring North Viet Nam , were supplied by Soviet aircraft .</s>

<s>the Royal Lao Army , on the other hand , was paid and equipped with American funds .</s>

<s>in six years , U.S. aid had amounted to more than $1.60 for each American -- a total of three hundred million dollars .</s>

<s>we were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened to ignite another war among the world's giants .</s>

<s>even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine guns ?</s>

<s>to find out , we traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled , in the daytime at least , by the Royal Lao Army : from Attopeu , the City of Buffalo Dung in the southeast , to Muong Sing , the City of Lions in the northwest , close to Communist China ( map , page 250 ) .</s>

<s>we rode over roads so rough that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts , all four wheels spinning uselessly .</s>

<s>we flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't crash .</s>

<s>in the end we ran into Communist artillery fire .</s>

<s>we were Bill Garrett of the National Geographic Illustrations Staff , whose three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any fighting man we met ;
Boun My , our interpreter ;
and myself .</s>

<s>Boun My -- the name means one who has a boun , a celebration , and is therefore lucky -- was born in Savannakhet , the Border of Paradise .</s>

<s>he had attended three universities in the United States .</s>

<s>but he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of Vientiane , including the royal capital , Luang Prabang .</s>

<s>before the airplanes came , he said , travel in Laos was just about impossible .</s>

<s>prime minister moves fast
alas , so it almost proved for us , too .</s>

<s>to go outside the few cities required permits .</s>

<s>and getting them seemed a life's work .</s>

<s>nobody wanted Americans to be hurt or captured , and few soldiers could be spared as escorts .</s>

<s>we were told that to the Pathet Lao , a kidnaped American was worth at least $750 , a fortune in Laos .</s>

<s>everyone had heard of the American contractor who had spurned an escort .</s>

<s>now Pathet Lao propagandists were reported marching him barefoot from village to village , as evidence of evil American intervention .</s>

<s>although we enjoyed our rounds of the government offices in Vientiane , with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation in French , we were getting nowhere .</s>

<s>we had nearly decided that all the tales of Lao lethargy must be true , when we were invited to take a trip with the Prime Minister .</s>

<s>could we be ready in 15 minutes ?</s>

<s>his Highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of town , and he was eager to be off .</s>

<s>Prince wears ten-gallon hat
and so , after a flight southeast to Savannakhet , we found ourselves bouncing along in a Jeep right behind the Land-Rover of Prince Boun Oum of Champassak , a tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush jacket and a ten-gallon hat from Texas .</s>

<s>from his shoulder bag peeked the seven-inch barrel of a Luger .</s>

<s>the temperature rose to 105-degrees .</s>

<s>with our company of soldiers , we made one long column of reddish dust .</s>

<s>in Keng Kok , the City of Silkworms , the Prime Minister bought fried chickens and fried cicadas , and two notebooks for me .</s>

<s>then we drove on , until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice fields , bouncing across their squat earth walls .</s>

<s>it was a spleen-crushing day .</s>

<s>an hour of bouncing , a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary .</s>

<s>more bouncing , another stop , a new house for teachers , a new well .</s>

<s>then off again , rushing to keep up .</s>

<s>we were miserable .</s>

<s>but our two Jeep mates -- Keo Viphakone from Luang Prabang and John Cool from Beaver , Pennsylvania -- were beaming under their coatings of dust .</s>

<s>together they had probably done more than any other men to help push Laos toward the 20th century -- constructively .</s>

<s>Mr. Keo , once a diplomat in Paris and Washington , was Commissioner of Rural Affairs .</s>

<s>John , an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the London School of Economics , headed the rural development division of J , the United States Operations Mission administering U.S. aid .</s>

<s>what you see are self-help projects , John said .</s>

<s>we ask the people what they want , and they supply the labor .</s>

<s>we send shovels , cement , nails , and corrugated iron for roofs .</s>

<s>that way they have an infirmary for $400 .</s>

<s>we have 2,500 such projects , and they add up to a lot more than just roads and wells and schools .</s>

<s>ask Mr. Keo .</s>

<s>Mr. Keo agreed .</s>

<s>our people have been used to accepting things as they found them , he said .</s>

<s>where there was no road , they lived without one .</s>

<s>now they learn that men can change their surroundings , through their traditional village elders , without violence .</s>

<s>that's a big step toward a modern state .</s>

<s>you might say we are in the nation-building business .</s>

<s>in the villages people lined up to give us flowers .</s>

<s>then came coconuts , eggs , and rice wine .</s>

<s>the Prime Minister paid his respects to the Buddhist monks , strode rapidly among the houses , joked with the local soldiery , and made a speech .</s>

<s>the soldiers are fighting and the Americans are helping , he said , but in the fight against the Pathet Lao the key factor is the villager himself .</s>

<s>then we were off again .</s>

<s>we did it for three days .</s>

<s>but our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery .</s>

<s>crossing the 4,000-foot width of the Mekong at Champassak , on a raft with an outboard motor , we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean breeze .</s>

<s>then we hung overboard in the water .</s>

<s>briefly we rolled over a paved road up to Pak Song , on the cool Bolovens Plateau .</s>

<s>the Prince visited the hospital of Operation Brotherhood , supported by the Junior Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines , and fed rice to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at Pak Song .</s>

<s>strings keep souls in place
in the village of Soukhouma , which means Peaceful , we had a baci .</s>

<s>this is the most endearing of Lao ceremonies .</s>

<s>it takes place in the household , a rite of well-wishing for myriad occasions -- for the traveler , a wedding , a newborn child , the sick , the New Year , for any good purpose .</s>

<s>the preparations were elaborate : flowers , candles , incense sticks , rice wine , dozens of delicacies , and pieces of white cotton string .</s>

<s>the strings were draped around flowers in tall silver bowls ( page 261 ) .</s>

<s>the candles were lighted , and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village notables .</s>

<s>I was careful to keep my feet , the seat of the least worthy spirits , from pointing at anyone's head , where the worthiest spirits reside .</s>

<s>now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to come and join us .</s>

<s>next he addressed himself to our souls .</s>

<s>a man has 32 souls , one for each part of the body .</s>

<s>those souls like to wander off , and must be called back .</s>

<s>with the divinities present and our souls in place , we were wished health , happiness , and power .</s>

<s>then , one after another , the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists .</s>

<s>these were to be kept on , to hold in the 32 souls .</s>

<s>as we stepped out into the sunlight , a man came up to John Cool and silently showed him his hand .</s>

<s>it had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar .</s>

<s>we could see maggots moving .</s>

<s>John said : I have some antiseptic salve with me , but it's too late for that .</s>

<s>my interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds .</s>

<s>Jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings .</s>

<s>being Jewish gives you tremendous drive , a boy remarked .</s>

<s>it means that you have to get ahead .</s>

<s>when I pressed for a purely religious definition , I encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety , interfaith good will , and a small residue of ethnic loyalty .</s>

<s>I like the tradition , a girl said .</s>

<s>I like to follow the holidays when they come along .</s>

<s>but you don't have to worship in the traditional way .</s>

<s>you can communicate in your own way .</s>

<s>as I see it , there's no real difference between being Jewish , Catholic , or Protestant .</s>

<s>another teen-ager remarked : most Jews don't believe in God , but they believe in people -- in helping people .</s>

<s>still another boy asserted : to be a good Jew is to do no wrong ;
it's to be a good person .</s>

<s>when asked how this was different from being a good Protestant , the boy answered , it's the same thing .</s>

<s>this accords with the study by Maier and Spinrad .</s>

<s>they discovered that , although 42 per cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion , only 8 per cent of the Jewish students had this conviction .</s>

<s>the most important aims of the Jewish students were as follows : to make the world a better place to live in -- 30 per cent ;
to get happiness for yourself -- 28 per cent ;
and financial independence -- 21 per cent .</s>

<s>nevertheless , most of the teen-agers I interviewed believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple .</s>

<s>however , they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy , professing to believe in Judaism but in a moderate way .</s>

<s>one boy said querulously about Orthodox Jews : it's the twentieth century , and they don't have to wear beards .</s>

<s>the reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers' minds .</s>

<s>we were brought up that way was one statement which won general assent .</s>

<s>I want to show respect for my parents' religion was the way in which a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism .</s>

<s>still another suggested that he would join a temple for social reasons , since I'll be living in a suburb .</s>

<s>intermarriage , which is generally regarded as a threat to Jewish survival , was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild , clinical disapproval .</s>

<s>most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds .</s>

<s>when you marry , you want to have things in common , a girl said , and it's hard when you don't marry someone with your own background .</s>

<s>a fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle West observed wryly that , in her community , religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities -- at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class Jews now regard as religious .</s>

<s>it appears that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would not travel on Saturday and , in addition , required kosher food .</s>

<s>another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as the only Orthodox girl in town .</s>

<s>this is , no doubt , inaccurate , but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the nonobservant .</s>

<s>the older teens
one of the significant things about Jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented .</s>

<s>sixty-five per cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning .</s>

<s>this is substantially higher than the figures for the American population at large -- 45.6 per cent for males and 29.2 per cent for females .</s>

<s>this may help explain a phenomenon described by a small-town Jewish boy .</s>

<s>in their first two years in high school , Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams .</s>

<s>however , in their junior and senior years , they generally forego their athletic pursuits , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement .</s>

<s>it is significant , too , that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed , unlike the younger ones , that Jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts .</s>

<s>the percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys .</s>

<s>the motivations for both sexes , to be sure , are different .</s>

<s>the vocational motive is the dominant one for boys , while Jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed .</s>

<s>one of the significant developments in American-Jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women .</s>

<s>it is they who read -- and make -- Jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them .</s>

<s>in upper teen Jewish life , the non-college group tends to have a sense of marginality .</s>

<s>people automatically assume that I'm in college , a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably .</s>

<s>however , among the girls , there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going to college .</s>

<s>the Jewish working girl almost invariably works in an office -- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers -- and , buttressed by a respectable income , she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college student .</s>

<s>she is even prone to regard the college girl as immature .</s>

<s>the lower-middle class college student
one of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost .</s>

<s>this is particularly true in large centers of Jewish population like New York , Chicago , and Philadelphia .</s>

<s>what is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-Jewish world .</s>

<s>perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn College -- constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session -- can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower-middle class Jewish student .</s>

<s>there is , to begin , an important sex difference .</s>

<s>typically , in a lower-middle class Jewish family , a son will be sent to an out-of-town school , if financial resources warrant it , while the daughter will attend the local college .</s>

<s>there are two reasons for this .</s>

<s>first , the girl's education has a lower priority than the son's .</s>

<s>second , the attitude in Jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son .</s>

<s>most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by keeping them home .</s>

<s>the consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically .</s>

<s>one can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town .</s>

<s>Brooklyn College students have an ambivalent attitude toward their school .</s>

<s>on the one hand , there is a sense of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high school .</s>

<s>this is particularly acute for those who attended Midwood High School directly across the street from Brooklyn College .</s>

<s>they have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status , the out-of-town school .</s>

<s>at the same time , there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good college -- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues -- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates .</s>

<s>it's people of your own kind , a girl remarked .</s>

<s>you don't have to watch what you say .</s>

<s>of course , I would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds of people , but I would want lots of Jewish kids there .</s>

<s>for most Brooklyn College students , college is at once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family .</s>

<s>Brooklyn College is unequivocally Jewish in tone , and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing .</s>

<s>however , a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents .</s>

<s>and the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but , rather , a protest against a culture that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping .</s>

<s>as long as I'm home , I'll never grow up , a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly .</s>

<s>they don't like it if I do anything away from home .</s>

<s>it's so much trouble , I don't usually bother .</s>

<s>for girls , the overprotection is far more pervasive .</s>

<s>parents will drive on Friday night to pick up their daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting .</s>

<s>a freshman girl's father not too long ago called a dean at Brooklyn College and demanded the low-down on a boy who was going out with his daughter .</s>

<s>the domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field .</s>

<s>under pressure from parents , the majority of Brooklyn College girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with marriage plans -- limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours .</s>

<s>this means that a great many academically talented girls are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature .</s>

<s>a kind of double standard exists here for Jewish boys and girls as it does in the realm of sex .</s>

<s>the breaking away from the prison house of Brooklyn is gradual .</s>

<s>first , the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights .</s>

<s>then , with the new affluence , there is actually a sallying forth into the wide , wide world beyond the precincts of New York .</s>

<s>it is significant that the Catskills , which used to be the summer playground for older teen-agers , a kind of summer suburb of New York , no longer attracts them in great numbers -- except for those who work there as waiters , bus boys , or counselors in the day camps .</s>

<s>the great world beyond beckons .</s>

<s>but it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places -- Fire Island , Nantucket , Westhampton , Long Island , for example -- tend to be homogeneously Jewish .</s>

<s>although Brooklyn College does not yet have a junior-year-abroad program , a good number of students spend summers in Europe .</s>

<s>in general , however , the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at Harvard or Smith .</s>

<s>and acculturation into the world at large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn College student after college rather than during the four school years .</s>

<s>Brooklyn College is Marjorie Morningstar territory , as much as the Bronx or Central Park West .</s>

<s>there are hordes of nubile young women there who , prodded by their impatient mothers , are determined to marry .</s>

<s>it is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere -- about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class -- the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate .</s>

<s>almost everybody in the senior class is married , students say dogmatically .</s>

<s>and the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities , sororities , and houses ( in the House Plan Association ) that have good news to impart .</s>

<s>these announcements are , in effect , advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage marts .</s>

<s>there are boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings , pinnings , ringings , engagements , and marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity .</s>

<s>Witt House happily announces the engagement of Fran Horowitz to Erwin Schwartz of Fife House .</s>

<s>the Brooklyn College student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models .</s>

<s>the Ivy League enjoys no easy dominion here , and the boys are as likely to dress in rather foppish Continental fashion , or even in nondescript working class manner , as they are in the restrained , button-down Ivy way .</s>

<s>the girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts out of town , and eye shadow , mascara , and elaborate bouffant hairdos -- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel -- are not unknown even in early morning classes .</s>

<s>among the boys , there is very little bravado about drinking .</s>

<s>Brooklyn College is distinctive for not having an official drinking place .</s>

<s>the Fort Lauderdale encampment for drinking is foreign to most Brooklyn College boys .</s>

<s>this should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ) .</s>

<s>for galled breasts , the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste .</s>

<s>this could also be used for any other skin irritation .</s>

<s>or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts .</s>

<s>female troubles of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier ;
at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection , one for hastening delayed menstruation .</s>

<s>the sufferer drinks tansy tea .</s>

<s>bruises , burns , cuts , etc.</s>

<s>, occurred frequently on the frontier , and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too .</s>

<s>bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak .</s>

<s>( doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of the applications which relieved the pain .
)</s>

<s>salted butter was another cure for bruises .</s>

<s>many people agreed that burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard , but one informant told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water ;
the burn oozed watery fluid for many days , and finally the healing was completed by bathing it with epsom salts .</s>

<s>another swore by vinegar baths for burns , and still another recommended salted butter .</s>

<s>butter salve or butter ointment was used for burns , and for bruises as well .</s>

<s>this was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil ;
when it was cool , the fat was skimmed off and bottled .</s>

<s>cow's milk was another cure for burns , and burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed quickly .</s>

<s>one man , badly burned about the face and eyes by an arc welding torch , was blinded and could not find a doctor at the time .</s>

<s>a sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings , which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the heat .</s>

<s>later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns .</s>

<s>the results were good , but which treatment helped is still not known .</s>

<s>to stop bleeding , cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds .</s>

<s>one old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut , even when on a knuckle , if it was made by a rusty tool ;
this would stop the flow and also prevent infection .</s>

<s>my lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and wounds ;
she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth , over which she poured turpentine .</s>

<s>he showed me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated and which his mother had treated ;
there is scarcely a scar showing .</s>

<s>tobacco was common first aid .</s>

<s>a chaw of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing .</s>

<s>or a thin slice of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing .</s>

<s>one old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his head .</s>

<s>his brother ran a mile to get the father ;
when they reached the boy , the father sliced a new plug of tobacco , put the scalp back in place , and covered the raw edges with the slices .</s>

<s>then he put a rag around the dressing to keep it in place .</s>

<s>there was no cleaning or further care , but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no scar .</s>

<s>veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding , and rue was an antiseptic .</s>

<s>until quite recently , sterile maggots could be bought to apply to a wound ;
they would feed on its surface , leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated .</s>

<s>tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound .</s>

<s>one family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips , or , if these were not handy , plain lard .</s>

<s>another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the wounded foot or hand in the smoke .</s>

<s>rabies were cured or prevented by madstones which the pioneer wore or carried .</s>

<s>in 1872 there were known to be twenty-two in Norton County , and one had been in the family for 200 years .</s>

<s>another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds , then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker .</s>

<s>while nowadays we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at the nose , not long ago a nosebleed was simply that , and treatment had little variation .</s>

<s>since a fall or blow might have caused it , a cold pack was usually first aid .</s>

<s>this might be applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck , pressed on the upper lip , or inserted into the nostril ( cotton was usually used in this last ) .</s>

<s>nosebleed could be stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient's neck and tying it in a knot for each year of his life .</s>

<s>or the victim could chew hard on a piece of paper , meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in his ears .</s>

<s>old sores could be healed by the constant application of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water .</s>

<s>blood blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous substance .</s>

<s>felons were cured by taking common salt and drying it in the oven , pounding it fine , and mixing it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine ;
this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the affected part .</s>

<s>this was used also for bruises .</s>

<s>yellow clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings ;
not long ago Denver Mud was most popular .</s>

<s>chiggers were a common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived ;

<s>bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief and also killed the pests .</s>

<s>ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing .</s>

<s>for mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half a glass of soda was made .</s>

<s>for wasp stings onion juice , obtained by scraping an onion , gave quick relief .</s>

<s>a handier remedy was to bathe the painful part in strong soapy water ;
mud was sometimes used as well as soap .</s>

<s>just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve wasp or bee stings .</s>

<s>bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days ;
to keep them out of homes , even in the 1900's , was a chore .</s>

<s>bed slats were washed in alum water , legs of beds were placed in cups of kerosene , and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate , applied with a feather .</s>

<s>kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer homes of the pests .</s>

<s>at times pioneer children got lice in their hair .</s>

<s>a kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment , but it did the job .</s>

<s>to remove an insect from one's ear warm water should be inserted .</s>

<s>a cinder or other small object could be removed from the eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye .</s>

<s>as the seed swelled its glutinous covering protected the eyeball from irritation , and both the cinder and the seed could soon be washed out .</s>

<s>another way to remove small objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed ;
the particle would then move toward the nose , where it could be wiped out with a wisp of cotton .</s>

<s>shingles were cured by gentian , an old drug , used in combinations .</s>

<s>for erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth .</s>

<s>itching skin , considered just nerves , was eased by treating with whiskey and salt .</s>

<s>winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped .</s>

<s>to cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in a quart of water .</s>

<s>they drank half a cup of this morning and night , and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same solution .</s>

<s>six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and had defied other remedies .</s>

<s>frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow .</s>

<s>now one hears that heat and hot water are used instead .</s>

<s>another remedy was oil of eucalyptus , used as well for chilblains .</s>

<s>chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves .</s>

<s>boils have always been a source of much trouble .</s>

<s>a German informant gave me a sure cure made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice .</s>

<s>another poultice was made from the inner bark of the elm tree , steeped in water until it formed a sticky , gummy solution .</s>

<s>this was also used for sores .</s>

<s>another frequent pioneer difficulty , caused by wearing rough and heavy shoes and boots , was corns .</s>

<s>one veracious woman tells me she has used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or fire .</s>

<s>another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water , then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight .</s>

<s>this softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on .</s>

<s>there were many cures for warts .</s>

<s>one young girl told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several times .</s>

<s>another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the house for seven days .</s>

<s>saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's sleep was considered poisonous ;
wetting a wart with this saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few treatments , and strangely enough many warts did just that .</s>

<s>one wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy .</s>

<s>another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours , tie it on the wart , and wear it for a week .</s>

<s>a simpler method was to tie a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way .</s>

<s>I know this worked .</s>

<s>one person recommended to me washing the wart with sulphur water ;
another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato three times daily .</s>

<s>another common method was to cut an onion in two and place each half on the wart for a moment ;
the onion was then fastened together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave .</s>

<s>as the onion decayed , so did the wart .</s>

<s>sore muscles were relieved by an arnica rub ;
sore feet by calf's-foot , an herb from the pioneer's ubiquitous herb garden , or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water in which two cups of salt had been dissolved .</s>

<s>leg cramps , one person tells me , were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the body on the heel and pressing down hard .</s>

<s>this does give relief , as I can testify .</s>

<s>one doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy before each meal for leg cramps .</s>

<s>pains in the back of the leg and in the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope about the patient's waist .</s>

<s>for sprains and swellings , one pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief .</s>

<s>except for the wine waiter in a restaurant -- always an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself , the genii with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world are one's dealer , and the foreign shipper or negociant who in turn supplies him .</s>

<s>in instances where both of these are persons or firms with integrity , the situation is ideal .</s>

<s>it may , on occasion , be anything but that .</s>

<s>however , by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice , one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines ( as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and promoters ) and , better yet , whether he has a taste for wine .</s>

<s>again , by spreading one's purchases over several wine dealers , one becomes familiar with the names and specialties of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad .</s>

<s>this is important because , despite all the efforts of the French government , an appreciable segment of France's export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty , and there are many too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a creditable reputation overseas .</s>

<s>a good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the best vineyards , or the best parts of them ;
he may also be the one who makes and bottles the best blends -- sound wines from vineyards generally in his own district .</s>

<s>these are the wines the French themselves use for everyday drinking , for even in France virtually no one drinks the Grands Crus on a meal-to-meal basis .</s>

<s>the Grands Crus are expensive , and even doting palates tire of them .</s>

<s>and certainly , in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker , the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the Grands Crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse to crus of less renown .</s>

<s>there is nothing infra dig about a good blend from a good shipper .</s>

<s>some of them are very delicious indeed , and there are many good ones exported -- unfortunately , along with others not so good , and worse .</s>

<s>consultation with a reputable wine dealer and constant experimentation -- steering ever from the known to the unknown -- are the requisites .</s>

<s>wine waiters are something else again ;
especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal , their importance mounts .</s>

<s>most of them , the world over , operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in France and some other Latin countries : the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise , with the burden of proof on the customer himself .</s>

<s>now the drinking of wine ( and happily so ]
) is for the most part a recondite affair , for manifestly , if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them , the supply would dry up in no time at all .</s>

<s>this is the only valid , and extenuating , argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter .</s>

<s>a really good wine waiter is , paradoxically , the guardian ( and not the purveyor ) of his cellar against the Visigoths .</s>

<s>faced , on the one hand , with an always exhaustible supply of his best wines , and on the other by a clientele usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks , it is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence .</s>

<s>the one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money .</s>

<s>only then , perhaps , will he reveal his jewels and his bargains .</s>

<s>wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served .</s>

<s>this is especially true of red wines , and a practice which , though not always practicable , is well worth the effort .</s>

<s>it does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days , but in terms of months and years it is fatal .</s>

<s>wine stored for a long time should be on its side ;
otherwise , the cork dries and air enters to spoil it .</s>

<s>when stacking wine on its side in a bin , care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next to the cork .</s>

<s>fat bottles , such as Burgundies , have a way of rolling around in the bin and often need little props , such as a bit of cardboard or a chip of wood , to hold them in the proper reclining posture .</s>

<s>too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks , again with ill effects .</s>

<s>the best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine ( provided the eye has not already spotted it ) is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling it : if it smells of wine , the bottle is probably all right ;
if it smells of cork , one has grounds for suspicion .</s>

<s>seasonal rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine : they age it prematurely .</s>

<s>the ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five degrees , with an allowable range of five degrees above or below this , provided there are no sudden or frequent changes .</s>

<s>prolonged vibration is also undesirable ;
consequently , one's wine closet or cellar should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces .</s>

<s>if one lives near a subway or an express parkway , the solution is to have one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time .</s>

<s>light , especially daylight , is always bad for wine .</s>

<s>all in all , though , there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking ;
many people go to extreme lengths in decanting , chilling or warming , or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork .</s>

<s>no one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ]
but the fact remains that in most restaurants , including some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon , the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal .</s>

<s>a white wine , already at cool cellar temperature , may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator ( the former is far preferable ) in about fifteen minutes ;
for those who live in a winter climate , there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow .</s>

<s>though by no means an ideal procedure , a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time .</s>

<s>it may be a bit cold when poured ;
but again , as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt , wine should be served in a large , tulip-shaped glass , which is never filled more than half full .</s>

<s>in this way , red wine warms of itself quite rapidly -- and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal ( or the course ) , in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages .</s>

<s>the only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire .</s>

<s>this invariably effaces any wine's character , and drives its fragrance underground .</s>

<s>it should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest in half-bottles , less fast in full bottles , slowly in Magnums -- and slower yet in Tregnums , double Magnums , Jeroboams , Methuselahs , and Imperiales , respectively .</s>

<s>very old red wines often require several hours of aeration , and any red wine , brought from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime , should be uncorked and allowed some air .</s>

<s>but white wines never ]
white wines should be opened when served , having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness .</s>

<s>thus , Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold ;
a Pouilly-Fuisse or a Chablis somewhat less cold .</s>

<s>over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine , especially a dry wine -- and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive .</s>

<s>the fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air .</s>

<s>to quote Professor Saintsbury : the last glass of claret or Burgundy is as good as the first ;
but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last ]
this does not mean , though , that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration : there is a reasonable limit -- and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day , after they have once been opened , are never as good .</s>

<s>if this must be done , they should always be corked and kept in a cool place ;
it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those of milk .</s>

<s>a few red wines , notably those of the Beaujolais , are better consumed at cellar temperature .</s>

<s>by tradition , a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature -- if anything a little cooler -- and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well .</s>

<s>thus , red wine must , if possible , never be disturbed or shaken ;
very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering , bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself .</s>

<s>a tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea .</s>

<s>the cork should be pulled gradually and smoothly , and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward .</s>

<s>many people use wicker cradles for old red wine , lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table , without disturbing the sediment .</s>

<s>another school frowns on such a shortcut , and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom , after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle .</s>

<s>in France , when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines , one visits the restaurant well ahead of time , chooses the wines and , with the advice of the manager and his chef , builds the menu around them .</s>

<s>the wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate , preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and , perhaps in the case of very old wines , be decanted .</s>

<s>decanting old wine aerates it fully ;
it may also be -- practically speaking -- a matter of good economy .</s>

<s>for , in the process of decanting , the bottle is only tilted once instead of several or more times at the table : hence , a minimum of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs .</s>

<s>though there are many exceptions , which we have noted in preceding pages , white wine is as a rule best consumed between two and six years old , and red wines , nowadays , between three and ten .</s>

<s>red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer ;
the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite number , red Burgundy .</s>

<s>some clarets do not come into their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age , or even more .</s>

<s>if a red Bordeaux of a good name and year is bitter or acid , or cloying and muddy-tasting , leave it alone for a while .</s>

<s>most of the wines of Beaujolais , on the other hand , should be drunk while very young ;
and Alsatians may be .</s>

<s>Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically : rest assured that your accompanying Letter of Instructions shall be in the Letter and Spirit strictly complied with and most particularly in regard to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane views .</s>

<s>Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation .</s>

<s>the slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under John Palfrey's overseer .</s>

<s>an excellent crop was expected that year .</s>

<s>William , who lived in neighboring St. Mary's parish , had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year .</s>

<s>Giffen advised acceptance of this plan , citing the depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions at the plantation .</s>

<s>if sold then , the land and improvements might bring only $5,000 .</s>

<s>early in January , 1844 he had a conference with Henry and William in New Orleans , and upon learning of Gorham's intention , Henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother .</s>

<s>the emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs , he contended , but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless Negroes .</s>

<s>they were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation , and Louisiana law required their removal from the state .</s>

<s>Gorham refused to accept money for slave property , but did he realize how much expense and trouble the transportation of his Negroes to the North involved ?</s>

<s>the suggestion that Giffen hire out the slaves was not realistic , since no planter would take the risk of having Negroes who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves .</s>

<s>Henry hid his annoyance , although both he and William were furious with their Yankee brother .</s>

<s>William , who did not write to Gorham , told Giffen that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year , he would sue amicably to protect his interests .</s>

<s>Palfrey was determined that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers during the transition period before emancipation .</s>

<s>if William wished to continue operations for a year , why not simply leave the Negroes undisturbed and pay them as high wages to remain there as are ever paid the labor of persons of their sex & age .</s>

<s>a disposition to exert themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them to come into the scheme .</s>

<s>their having family ties on our plantation & the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement .</s>

<s>when he heard of his brothers' anger , Palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages .</s>

<s>if not , he was willing to accede to William's wishes in any way that did not block his ultimate aim .</s>

<s>William was adamant on one point : under no circumstances would he allow the Negroes to remain on the plantation with his and Henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom .</s>

<s>knowing the antipathy that existed in Louisiana against increasing the number of free Negroes , Giffen suggested that Palfrey bring them to Boston at once , and then send them on to Liberia .</s>

<s>lacking specific instructions , he agreed to William's condition .</s>

<s>in March there was a division of the slaves , and Giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible .</s>

<s>of the fifty-two slaves , Giffen succeeded in getting a lot of twenty , twelve of whom were females .</s>

<s>I considered that your views would be best carried out , he explained , by taking women whose progeny will of course be free & more fully extend the philantrophy of Emancipation .</s>

<s>I have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of Conscience & Justice .</s>

<s>the ages of the slaves ranged from sixty-five , for an old house servant , to an unnamed newborn child .</s>

<s>if Palfrey ever had any doubts about the wickedness of slavery , they were put aside after he received an inventory of the slave property he had inherited .</s>

<s>this cold reckoning of human worth in a legal paper , devoid of compassion or humanity , was all he needed .</s>

<s>each human being , known only by a given name , had a cash value .</s>

<s>old Sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150 ;
;
Rose , a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential , was worth $400 .</s>

<s>in rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property , Palfrey was giving up close to $7,000 .</s>

<s>Palfrey's brothers each received lots of sixteen Negroes , and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed that all lots were to be valued at $6,666.66 .</s>

<s>thus twenty black souls were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land of free men .</s>

<s>Giffen extracted one concession from William : the house servants could be free at any time Gorham thought expedient .</s>

<s>despite Giffen's warning , Palfrey still had plans for freeing his slaves in Louisiana .</s>

<s>yet even if he could get the necessary approval , fourteen of his Negroes could not be manumitted without special permission .</s>

<s>according to state law a slave had to be at least thirty years old before he could be freed .</s>

<s>Palfrey petitioned the state legislature to waive the requirement .</s>

<s>otherwise , freedom would mean removal from the state in which as the place of their past residence from birth , or for many years , it would be materially for their advantage to be at liberty to remain .</s>

<s>on March 11 the Louisiana legislature voted unanimously to table the petition .</s>

<s>news of the legislative veto appeared in the New Orleans papers , and Henry and William became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt in advance .</s>

<s>Henry stormed into Giffen's office waving a copy of the New Orleans Courier , shouting that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair , and that it would reach the Ears of the People on the Plantation , and make them restless & unhappy .</s>

<s>his brothers' anger caused Palfrey genuine concern , for he had imposed a dual mission upon himself : to free his slaves , and to keep the family from falling apart over the issue .</s>

<s>when Giffen decided to charge him interest on the loan from John Palfrey , Gorham readily assented , vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents , his brothers would never have any cause to complain of him .</s>

<s>in view of these difficulties , Palfrey decided to go to Louisiana .</s>

<s>Giffen had already urged him to journey south , if only for a few days to clear up matters .</s>

<s>his duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-April .</s>

<s>Palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time , and left for New Orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of Providence that he might be allowed to see his family again .</s>

<s>during his journey Palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists .</s>

<s>in both cases he desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived in the North .</s>

<s>in New York , Lydia Maria Child welcomed him enthusiastically : I have lately heard of you from the Legislature of Louisiana , and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood of man .</s>

<s>Mrs. Child , who had once apologized for sending editor Palfrey a book on slavery , now confided that she had helped one of Henry Palfrey's slaves escape to Canada some years before , but asked him not to advertise the fact in Louisiana .</s>

<s>she agreed to take charge of five or six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send them north immediately .</s>

<s>at Lexington , Kentucky , Palfrey consulted with Cassius M. Clay on the same subject , but with no apparent result .</s>

<s>despite his apprehensions about his personal safety , Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial .</s>

<s>instead of the expected annoyances due to the nature of his mission , he received many calling cards and invitations from gentlemen of mark , on whom I had no sort of claim , & have had many more invitations than I could accept .</s>

<s>he later told abolitionist Edmund Quincy of the marked attention and civility with which the New Orleans gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him .</s>

<s>the memory of this southern hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years and Civil War .</s>

<s>Palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic account of two perilous days spent among the planters of Attakapas , many of whom were coarse & passionate people , much excited by what they heard of my plans .</s>

<s>he proceeded with his task bravely -- in his memoirs , at least -- before the passions of my neighbors should have time to boil too high .</s>

<s>Palfrey had already made up his mind that he would allow the men , but not the women , to choose freely whether or not to go North for freedom .</s>

<s>the women by remaining behind condemned their children , born and unborn , to bondage .</s>

<s>he had a short private talk with each adult slave .</s>

<s>only one objected , but Palfrey soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others .</s>

<s>all the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure until the end of the planting season , so that they could get in their own little produce .</s>

<s>Palfrey agreed ;
the slaves were to remain as wage laborers for his account .</s>

<s>William's threat that under no conditions would he allow freedom-conscious slaves to mix with his own was not carried out , for the plantation continued in operation as before .</s>

<s>Palfrey returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement so satisfactory to my judgment & my conscience .</s>

<s>from Cambridge , Palfrey maintained a close interest in the welfare of his slaves .</s>

<s>in fact , as the time for their departure approached , his solicitousness increased .</s>

<s>should any slave change his mind and request to leave earlier , Giffen was to provide passage at once .</s>

<s>when a sailing date of March , 1845 was finally established , Palfrey made sure that the Negroes would have comfortable quarters in New Orleans and aboard ship .</s>

<s>Giffen assured him that the captain and his mate had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration .</s>

<s>Palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage to pay for their labor throughout 1844 .</s>

<s>the plantation was sold in January , 1845 , and Palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people two months' wages .</s>

<s>Giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation for a year's work ;
the new owner at Attakapas declined to enter into any philanthropic arrangement .</s>

<s>on March 21 , 1845 the bark Bashaw weighed anchor at New Orleans , while on the levee Henry and William Palfrey waved farewell to their father's former chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled regret and jubilation .</s>

<s>not all of Palfrey's slaves were aboard the Bashaw .</s>

<s>Giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants .</s>

<s>two of these were included in Palfrey's lot .</s>

<s>Giffen filed a petition for permission to emancipate four slaves ( all more than fifty years old ) with the St. Martin's Parish Police Jury .</s>

<s>after an initial rejection , which he attributed to a general Excitement against Abolition and Emancipation , Giffen bribed the right individuals on the jury , and got the permission without further delay .</s>

<s>when the Negroes landed at Boston a month later they were , of course , no longer slaves .</s>

<s>slavery was prohibited in Massachusetts by the terms of the constitution of 1780 , which declared all men are born free and equal .</s>

<s>nevertheless , Palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at King's Chapel to formalize the emancipation .</s>

<s>an eyewitness recalled how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed in the church doorway , and the diffidence the former slaves displayed while they listened to the few words that declared them free .</s>

<s>once the question of emancipation was settled to Palfrey's satisfaction , he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes as servants .</s>

<s>Palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a Negro boy in the Hopedale Community , but he had better luck in his other attempts .</s>

<s>Mrs. Child , true to her word , helped place Anna and her four children with a Quaker family named Hathaway near Canandaigua , New York .</s>

<s>this group had been Palfrey's greatest worry since Anna was in bad health , and her children were too young to work for their keep .</s>

<s>but certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington a group more varied in background and interest .</s>

<s>Secretary of State Dean Rusk , a former Rhodes Scholar and Mills College dean , has headed the Rockefeller Foundation and in that role expended large sums for international cultural exchange .</s>

<s>Walton , who soon made a break from journalism to become one of the capital's leading semi-abstract painters , vows that he and Kennedy never once discussed art in those days .</s>

<s>a man of great talent , he will continue to serve as a sort of Presidential trouble-shooter , strictly ex officio , for culture .</s>

<s>a more official representative is the Secretary of the Interior .</s>

<s>Udall , who comes from one of the Mormon first-families of Arizona , is a bluff , plain-spoken man with a lust for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight .</s>

<s>but even while sparring furiously with Republican politicians , he displays a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments .</s>

<s>his private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals such as C. P. Snow , Arnold Toynbee , and Aaron Copland .</s>

<s>Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover a great deal more than dams and wildlife preserves .</s>

<s>after promoting Frost's appearance at the Inauguration , he persuaded the poet to return several months later to give a reading to a select audience of Cabinet members , members of Congress , and other Washington notables gathered in the State Department auditorium .</s>

<s>the event was so successful that the Interior Secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar ones from time to time , hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment of the Administration .</s>

<s>his ideas in this respect , however , sometimes arouse critical response .</s>

<s>one tempest was stirred up last March when Udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue of William Jennings Bryan , sculpted by the late Gutzon Borglum , would be sent on indefinite loan to Salem , Illinois , Bryan's birthplace .</s>

<s>spokesmen for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors promptly claimed that Udall was exiling the statue because of his own hostility to this art form .</s>

<s>they dug up a speech he had made two years earlier as a Congressman , decrying the more than two hundred statues , monuments , and memorials which dot the Washington landscape as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching new plans .</s>

<s>hoping to cut down on such works , Udall had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized .</s>

<s>he is not likely to win this battle easily .</s>

<s>in the case of the Borglum statue an Interior aide was obliged to announce that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Secretary had no desire to hustle it out of Washington .</s>

<s>the last Congress adopted seven bills for memorials , including one to Taras Shevchenko , the Ukrainian poet laureate ;
eleven others were introduced .</s>

<s>active warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first Roosevelt on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac , and TR.</s>

<s>'s own living children , who wish to preserve the island as a wildlife sanctuary .</s>

<s>the hotly debated plan for the capital's Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial , a circle of huge tablets engraved with his speeches ( and promptly dubbed by one of its critics , Instant Stonehenge ) , is another of Udall's headaches , since as supervisor of the National Parks Commission he will share in the responsibility for building it .</s>

<s>Washington , President Kennedy has been heard to remark ironically , is a city of southern efficiency and northern charm .</s>

<s>there have been indications that he hopes to redress that situation , commencing with the White House .</s>

<s>one of Mrs. Kennedy's initial concerns as First Lady was the sad state of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national shrine .</s>

<s>ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture assembled by President Thomas Jefferson , the White House has collected a hodgepodge of period pieces , few of them authentic or aesthetic .</s>

<s>Mrs. Kennedy shows a determination to change all this .</s>

<s>not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk , hewed from the timbers of the British ship H.M.S.</s>

<s>Resolute and presented to President Hayes by Queen Victoria .</s>

<s>it now serves the President in his oval office .</s>

<s>later , browsing in an old issue of the Gazette Des Beaux-Arts , she found a description of a handsome gilt pier-table purchased in 1817 by President James Monroe .</s>

<s>she traced it to a storage room .</s>

<s>with its coating of gold radiator paint removed -- a gaucherie of some earlier tenant -- it will now occupy its rightful place in the oval Blue Room on the first floor of the White House .</s>

<s>but it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century furniture ( which Mrs. Kennedy feels is the proper period for the White House ) must be pursued in places other than government storage rooms .</s>

<s>the First Lady appointed a Fine Arts Advisory Committee for the White House , to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange ways to acquire them .</s>

<s>her effort to put the home of living Presidents on the same basis as Mount Vernon and Monticello recognizes no party lines .</s>

<s>by rough estimate her Committee , headed by Henry Francis Du Pont , contains three times as many Republicans as Democrats .</s>

<s>the press releases emanating from the White House give a clue to the activity within .</s>

<s>a curator has been appointed .</s>

<s>a valuable pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Honore Fragonard has been donated by the art dealer Georges Wildenstein and now hangs in the Blue Room .</s>

<s>the American Institute of Interior Designers is redecorating the White House library .</s>

<s>secretary and Mrs. Dillon have contributed enough pieces of Empire furniture , including Dolley Madison's own sofa , to furnish a room in that style .</s>

<s>and part of a fabulous collection of vermeil hollowware , bequeathed to the White House by the late Mrs. Margaret Thompson Biddle , has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display in the State dining room .</s>

<s>woman's place is in the home : man must attend to matters of the yard .</s>

<s>one of the vexatious problems to first confront President Kennedy was the property lying just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House .</s>

<s>Congress had already appropriated money , and plans were well along to tear down the buildings flanking Lafayette Square and replace them with what one critic calls the marble monumentality of government office buildings .</s>

<s>while a Senator , Kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to preserve the Belasco Theater , as well as the Dolley Madison and the Benjamin Taylor houses , all scheduled for razing .</s>

<s>what to do about it now that he was President ?</s>

<s>only a few days after moving into the White House .</s>

<s>Kennedy made a midnight inspection of the Square .</s>

<s>then he called in his friend Walton and turned over the problem to him , with instructions to work out what was best -- provided it didn't pile unnecessary burdens on the President .</s>

<s>the situation involved some political perils .</s>

<s>one of the offices slated for reconstruction is the aged Court of Claims , diagonally across the street from the White House .</s>

<s>logically , it should be moved downtown .</s>

<s>but Judge Marvin Jones , senior member of the Court , is an elderly gentleman who lives at the nearby Metropolitan Club and desires to walk to work .</s>

<s>more importantly , he also happens to be the brother-in-law of Sam Rayburn , Speaker of the House .</s>

<s>there were aesthetic problems as well as political .</s>

<s>on delving deeper , Walton discovered that most of the buildings fronting the Square could be classified as early nondescript .</s>

<s>the old Belasco Theater , over which many people had grown sentimental , was only a shell of its former self after arduous years as a J Center .</s>

<s>the Dolley Madison House , Walton concluded , was scarcely worth preserving .</s>

<s>the attempt to save the Square's historic value , he declares , came half a century too late .</s>

<s>surrounded by ancient elms , the campus is spacious and beautiful .</s>

<s>the buildings are mostly Georgian .</s>

<s>the Dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion , as he once did .</s>

<s>but his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence , and he must go far , even though he may go fast , for sophisticated pleasures .</s>

<s>he is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence , if he chooses to be .</s>

<s>he is by no means the country boy he might have been in the last century , down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning in his heart .</s>

<s>the men's shops on Hanover's Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven .</s>

<s>and the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each weekend , toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke , are no less rakish than those leaving Cambridge or West Philadelphia .</s>

<s>but there has always been an outdoor air to Dartmouth .</s>

<s>the would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment .</s>

<s>no one here pokes fun at manly virtues .</s>

<s>and this gives rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League .</s>

<s>it even affects the faculty .</s>

<s>thus , when Dartmouth's Winter Carnival -- widely recognized as the greatest , wildest , roaringest college weekend anywhere , any time -- was broadcast over a national television hookup , Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter garb , topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been acquired from a Smith girl .</s>

<s>President Dickey's golden retriever , frolicking in the snow at his feet , added to the picture of masculine informality .</s>

<s>this carefree disdain for side cropped up again in the same television broadcast .</s>

<s>Dean Thaddeus Seymour , wearing ski clothes , was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the Carnival .</s>

<s>she must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head .</s>

<s>so he kissed her .</s>

<s>no Dartmouth man was surprised .</s>

<s>Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal sang-froid .</s>

<s>for example , groups regularly canoe down the Connecticut River .</s>

<s>this is in honor of John Ledyard , class of 1773 , who scooped a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in his own student days .</s>

<s>and these hardy travelers are not unappreciated today .</s>

<s>they are hailed by the nation's press , and Smith girls throng the riverbanks at Northampton and refresh the voyageurs with hot soup and kisses .</s>

<s>Dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic recreation is skiing .</s>

<s>since the days when their two thousand pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the United States , the students have stopped regarding the Olympic Ski Team as another name for their own .</s>

<s>yet Dartmouth still is the dominant member of the Intercollegiate Ski Union , which includes the winter sports colleges of Canada as well as those of this country .</s>

<s>Dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter , starting with their own front door .</s>

<s>they can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him , or move out to Oak Hill , where there's a lift .</s>

<s>the Dartmouth Skiway , at Holt's Ledge , ten miles north of the campus , has one of the best terrains in the East , ranging from novice to expert .</s>

<s>forty miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke , Dartmouth's own mountain .</s>

<s>here , at the Ravine Lodge , President Dickey acts as host every year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the Dartmouth Outing Club to life on the trails .</s>

<s>the Lodge , built of hand-hewn virgin spruce , can handle fifty people for dining , sleeping , or lounging in its huge living room .</s>

<s>the Outing Club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and several shelters , extending from the Vermont hills , just across the river from the college , through Hanover to the College Grant -- 27,000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in the logging country .</s>

<s>the cabins are equipped with bunks , blankets , and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips .</s>

<s>the club runs regular trips to the cabins , but many of the students prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting , fishing , climbing , or skiing .</s>

<s>under the auspices of the Outing Club , Dartmouth also has the Mountaineering Club , which takes on tough climbs like Mount McKinley , and Bait & Bullet , whose interests are self-evident , and even sports a Woodman's Team , which competes with other New England colleges in wood sawing and chopping , canoe races , and the like .</s>

<s>there is much to be said for a college that , while happily attuned to the sophisticated Ivies , still gives its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along back roads where a glimpse of small game , deer , or even bear is not uncommon .</s>

<s>city boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle or in the sharp tang of a sawmill , come upon suddenly in a backwoods logging camp .</s>

<s>and on the summit of Mount Washington , where thirty-five degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world , there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the Himalayas because it is there .</s>

<s>there is much to be said for such a college -- and Dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too loudly .</s>

<s>their affection for their college home has even caused President Dickey to comment on this place loyalty as something rather specially Hanoverian .</s>

<s>probably a lawyer once said it best for all time in the Supreme Court of the United States .</s>

<s>early in the nineteenth century the State of New Hampshire was casting about for a way to found its own state university .</s>

<s>it fixed on Dartmouth College , which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered .</s>

<s>the legislators decided to liberate Dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war with the college trustees over the control of classrooms , faculty , and chapel .</s>

<s>for a time there were two factions on the campus fighting for possession of the student body .</s>

<s>the struggle was resolved in 1819 in the Supreme Court in one of the most intriguing cases in our judicial history .</s>

<s>in 1817 the lawyers were generally debating the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters .</s>

<s>a lawyer , hired by the college , was arguing specifically for Dartmouth : Daniel Webster , class of 1801 , made her plight the dramatic focus of his whole plea .</s>

<s>in an age of oratory , he was the king of orators , and both he himself and Chief Justice Marshall were bathed in manly tears , as Uncle Dan'l reached his thundering climax : it is , sir , as I have said , a small college , and yet there are those who love it .</s>

<s>Dartmouth is today still a small college -- and still a private one , thanks to Webster's eloquence .</s>

<s>this is not out of keeping with its origins , probably the most humble of any in the Ivy group .</s>

<s>Eleazar Wheelock , a Presbyterian minister , founded the school in 1769 , naming it after the second earl of Dartmouth , its sponsor and benefactor .</s>

<s>Eleazar , pausing on the Hanover plain , found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands built the first College Hall , a log hut dedicated for the education & instruction of youth of the Indian Tribes in this land in reading , writing & all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing children of pagans as well as in all liberal arts and sciences ;
and also of English youth and any others .</s>

<s>it was a hardy undertaking , and Wheelock's was indeed a voice crying in the wilderness .</s>

<s>a road had to be hacked through trackless forests between Hanover and Portsmouth to permit Governor Wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first Dartmouth commencement in 1771 .</s>

<s>the governor and his retinue thoughtfully brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still one of the cherished possessions of the college .</s>

<s>the exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent Dartmouth gatherings .</s>

<s>a student orator produced tears from a great number of the learned even before the punch was served .</s>

<s>then from the branches of a near-by tree an Indian underclassman , disdaining both the platform and the English language , harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue .</s>

<s>Governor Wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green beneath the three-hundred-foot pines , and a barrel of rum was broached .</s>

<s>the cook got drunk , and President Wheelock proved to be a man of broad talents by carving the ox himself .</s>

<s>future commencements were more decorous perhaps , but the number of graduates increased from the original four at a relatively slow pace .</s>

<s>by the end of the nineteenth century , in 1893 , when the Big Three , Columbia , and Penn were populous centers of learning , Dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine .</s>

<s>the dormitories , including the beloved Dartmouth Hall , could barely house two hundred students in Spartan fashion .</s>

<s>then in 1893 Dr. William Jewett Tucker became president and the college's great awakening began .</s>

<s>he transformed Dartmouth from a small New Hampshire institution into a national college .</s>

<s>by 1907 the number of undergraduates had risen to 1,107 .</s>

<s>and at his last commencement , in that year , Dr. Tucker and Dartmouth were honored by the presence of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the college .</s>

<s>the presidents of Cornell , Wisconsin , C.C.N.Y.</s>

<s>, Bowdoin , Vermont , Brown , Columbia , Princeton , Yale , and Harvard and the presidents emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there .</s>

<s>Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today , with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates .</s>

<s>but it has achieved a cross-section of students from almost all the states , and two-thirds of its undergraduates come from outside New England .</s>

<s>over 450 different schools are usually represented in each entering class .</s>

<s>only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students , and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single delegation .</s>

<s>about two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools .</s>

<s>it is still a college only and not a university ;
it is , in fact , the only college in the Ivy group .</s>

<s>however , three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums -- the Dartmouth Medical School ( third oldest in the country and founded in 1797 ) , the Thayer School of Engineering , and the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration .</s>

<s>all three are purposely kept small , with a current total enrollment of about two hundred .</s>

<s>all three schools coordinate their educational programs with that of the undergraduate college and , like the college proper , place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation for specialized study .</s>

<s>students of the college who are candidates for the A.B.</s>

<s>degree and can satisfy the academic requirements of the medical and business schools , may enter either of these associated schools at the beginning of senior year , thus completing the two-year postgraduate course in one year .</s>

<s>the Thayer School offers a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way , after a boy wins a B.S.</s>

<s>in engineering .</s>

<s>so Dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the Ivy group .</s>

<s>it is still , however , the junior member of the League , if not in years at least in the catching up it has had to do .</s>

<s>it has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other Ivies have enjoyed .</s>

<s>however much football has been over-emphasized , the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by the scoreboard , so , while Yale need never give its record a thought again since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888 , Dartmouth had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national recognition .</s>

<s>it has come on with a rush in more significant areas .</s>

<s>today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking .</s>

<s>but Dartmouth preserves its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes , and , although some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage , they make for lively copy .</s>

<s>President Emeritus Hopkins once proposed to corral an aristocracy of brains in Hanover .</s>

<s>the person who left the buggy there has never been identified .</s>

<s>it was a busy street , conveniently near the shopping center , and unattended horses and wagons were often left at the curbside .</s>

<s>there are , of course , many weaknesses in any case against Emma .</s>

<s>she didn't like her stepmother , but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage .</s>

<s>she had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed .</s>

<s>she would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her travels .</s>

<s>if she avoided the train and hired a buggy , the stableman might have recognized her .</s>

<s>if police had checked on her more thoroughly than is indicated , she would be completely eliminated as a suspect .</s>

<s>Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate popular suspect .</s>

<s>his sudden unannounced appearance at the Borden home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him , although he clearly intended to stay overnight , if not longer .</s>

<s>Lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders , she had been disturbed by their voices and had closed her door , even though it was a very hot day .</s>

<s>it is evident that Lizzie did not tell everything she overheard between her father and her Uncle Morse .</s>

<s>at that time Jennings had a young law associate named Arthur S. Phillips .</s>

<s>a few years ago , not too long before his death , Phillips revealed in a newspaper story that he had always suspected Morse of the murders .</s>

<s>he said Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house that day , information which must have come from Lizzie .</s>

<s>it was obviously the sound of this argument that caused Lizzie to close her door .</s>

<s>the New Bedford Standard-Times has reported Knowlton as saying , long after the trial , that if he only knew what Borden said during his conversation with Morse , he would have convicted somebody .</s>

<s>notice , Knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a conviction in the trial of Lizzie Borden .</s>

<s>he said he would have convicted somebody .</s>

<s>it is known that Morse did associate with a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at Westport , a town not far from Fall River .</s>

<s>they were a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable characters .</s>

<s>Fall River police did go to Westport to see if they could get any information against Morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from among these men .</s>

<s>these officers found no incriminating information .</s>

<s>Morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed .</s>

<s>he said he returned from the visit to his niece on the 11:20 streetcar .</s>

<s>the woman in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner .</s>

<s>Fall River is not a fashionable town .</s>

<s>the dinner hour there was twelve noon .</s>

<s>if this woman had delayed until after 11:20 to start her shopping , she would have had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was eaten at dinner in those days .</s>

<s>it is possible that Morse told the woman it was 11:20 , but it could have been earlier , since she did serve dinner on time .</s>

<s>police did make an attempt to check on Morse's alibi .</s>

<s>they interviewed the conductor of the streetcar Morse said he had taken , but the man did not remember Morse as a passenger .</s>

<s>questioned further , Morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him .</s>

<s>the conductor did recall having priests as passengers and this satisfied police , although the conductor also pointed out that in heavily Catholic Fall River there were priests riding on almost every trip the streetcar made , so Morse's statement really proved nothing .</s>

<s>we do know that Morse left the house before nine o'clock .</s>

<s>Bridget testified she saw him leave through the side door .</s>

<s>Morse said Borden let him out and locked the screen door .</s>

<s>from that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked leisurely to where his niece was staying , more than a mile away .</s>

<s>he met nobody he knew on this walk .</s>

<s>there is no accounting of his movements in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when Mrs. Borden was killed .</s>

<s>Morse testified that while he was having breakfast in the dining room , Mrs. Borden told the servant , Bridget , I want you to wash these windows today .</s>

<s>Bridget's testimony was in direct contradiction .</s>

<s>she said it was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the back yard that Mrs. Borden told her to wash the windows .</s>

<s>this was long after Morse had left the house .</s>

<s>Morse's knowledge of what Mrs. Borden told Bridget could indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden there .</s>

<s>he knew the house fairly well , he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone .</s>

<s>and despite Knowlton's attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than a drum , this was not true .</s>

<s>the screen door was unlocked for some ten or fifteen minutes while Bridget was sick in the back .</s>

<s>it was unlocked all the time she was washing windows .</s>

<s>Morse could have returned openly while Bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room he had occupied .</s>

<s>Mrs. Borden would not have been alarmed if she saw Morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand .</s>

<s>he had been to the farm the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet at the farm .</s>

<s>Mrs. Borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she could cry out .</s>

<s>he could have left for Weybosset Street after her murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar .</s>

<s>if he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on his return , he could have arrived at the Borden house shortly after Mr. Borden came home .</s>

<s>with Lizzie in the barn , the screen door unlocked and Bridget upstairs in her attic room , he would have had free and easy access to the house .</s>

<s>with the second murder over , he could have left , hidden the weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood .</s>

<s>his unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree , with crowds already gathering in front of the building and Sawyer guarding the side door , was odd .</s>

<s>there was no close examination of his clothes for bloodstains , and certainly no scientific test was made of them .</s>

<s>and for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing , a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed .</s>

<s>the motive may have been the mysterious quarrel ;
there was no financial gain for Morse in the murders .</s>

<s>on the other side of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with whom she was staying .</s>

<s>the time would have been shortly after the murder of Mrs. Borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior .</s>

<s>he said he had promised Mrs. Borden to return in time for dinner and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the Borden house .</s>

<s>what did Pearson say about Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect in his trial-book essay ?</s>

<s>he wrote : the police soon ceased to look upon either Bridget or Mr. Morse as in possession of guilty knowledge .</s>

<s>neither had any interest in the deaths ;
indeed , it was probably to Mr. Morse's advantage to have Mr. and Mrs. Borden alive .</s>

<s>both he and Bridget were exonerated by Lizzie herself .</s>

<s>that was his complete discussion of Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect .</s>

<s>although Pearson disbelieved almost everything Lizzie said , and read a sinister purpose into almost everything she did , he happily accepted her statement about Bridget as the whole truth .</s>

<s>he felt nothing further need be said about the servant girl .</s>

<s>the exoneration Pearson speaks of is not an exoneration , but Lizzie's expression of her opinion , as reported in the testimony of Assistant Marshal Fleet .</s>

<s>this officer had asked Lizzie if she suspected her Uncle Morse , and she replied she didn't think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned after them .</s>

<s>Fleet asked the same question about Bridget , and Lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget had gone up to her room before her father's murder and came down when she called her .</s>

<s>Lizzie , actually , never named any suspect .</s>

<s>she told police about the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some weeks before the murders , but she said she thought he was from out of town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner .</s>

<s>and , much as she detested Hiram Harrington , she also did not accuse him .</s>

<s>at the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew anybody her father had bad feelings toward , or who had bad feelings toward her father .</s>

<s>she replied , I know of one man that has not been friendly with him .</s>

<s>they have not been friendly for years .</s>

<s>asked who this was , she named Harrington .</s>

<s>her statement certainly was true ;
the press reported the same facts in using Harrington's interview , but Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington was the killer .</s>

<s>when I interviewed Kirby , who as a boy picked up pears in the Borden yard , I asked if anybody else in the household besides Lizzie and Morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the murders .</s>

<s>he said he had not heard of anybody else .</s>

<s>how about Bridget Sullivan ?</s>

<s>I inquired .</s>

<s>oh , she was just the maid there , he replied , waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant she was .</s>

<s>Kirby was , of course , reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders .</s>

<s>everyone somehow manages to overlook completely the fact that , as far as we know , there were exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both murders : Lizzie Borden and Bridget Sullivan .</s>

<s>all the officials on the case seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as Bridget was concerned , although records in police files contain many reports of servants who have murdered their employers .</s>

<s>true , it is no longer cricket for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction , but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations .</s>

<s>the actions of Bridget should be examined , since she was there and opportunity did exist , if only to establish her innocence .</s>

<s>there are also other factors that require closer examination .</s>

<s>the legend as it exists in Fall River today always includes the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the trial with a big bundle of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut .</s>

<s>the people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points , always to the detriment of Lizzie .</s>

<s>if Bridget did get any bundles of cash , the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would have been Lizzie Borden .</s>

<s>Bridget was born in Ireland , one of fourteen children .</s>

<s>she was apparently the pioneer in her family because she had no close relatives in this country at that time .</s>

<s>she worked as a domestic , first in Newport for a year , and then in South Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , for another year .</s>

<s>she finally settled in Fall River and , after being employed for a time by a Mrs. Reed , was hired by the Bordens .</s>

<s>I have previously described how , during the week of the murder , Bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing and ironing clothes .</s>

<s>her father , James Upton , was the Upton mentioned by Hawthorne in the famous introduction to the Scarlet Letter as one of those who came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor of the port .</s>

<s>a gentleman of the old school , Mr. Upton possessed intellectual power , ample means , and withal , was a devoted Christian .</s>

<s>the daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical subjects .</s>

<s>her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad interests .</s>

<s>there is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood had an unusual mind .</s>

<s>she possessed an observant eye , a retentive memory , and a critical faculty .</s>

<s>when she was nine years old , she wrote a description of a store she had visited .</s>

<s>she named 48 items , and said there were many more things which it would take too long to write .</s>

<s>an essay on Freedom written at 10 years of age quoted the Declaration of Independence , the freedom given to slaves in Canada , and the views of George Washington .</s>

<s>Lucy Upton was graduated from the Salem High School when few colleges , only Oberlin and Elmira , were open to women ;
and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied .</s>

<s>a picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate , Albert S. Flint , friend of her brother Winslow , and later , like Winslow , a noted astronomer .</s>

<s>he recalled Lucy , as a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly through the boys' study hall to join the class in Greek in the little recitation room beyond .</s>

<s>the study of Greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college , and Lucy Upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men .</s>

<s>the death of her mother in 1865 prevented this .</s>

<s>with four younger children at home , Lucy stepped into her mother's role , and even after the brothers and sisters were grown , she was her father's comfort and stay until he died in 1879 .</s>

<s>but even so Lucy could not give up her intellectual pursuits .</s>

<s>when her brother Winslow became a student at Brown University in 1874 , she wrote him about a course in history he was taking under Professor Diman : what is Prof. Diman's definition of civilization , and take the world through , is its progress ever onward , or does it retrograde at times ?</s>

<s>do you think I might profitably study some of the history you do , perhaps two weeks behind you .</s>

<s>and that she proceeded to do .</s>

<s>many years later ( on August 3 , 1915 ) , Lucy Upton wrote Winslow's daughter soon to be graduated from Smith College : while I love botany which , after dabbling in for years , I studied according to the methods of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school , it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way you are doing .</s>

<s>whatever was the science in the high school course for the time being , that was my favorite study .</s>

<s>mathematics came next .</s>

<s>her study of history was persistently pursued .</s>

<s>she read Maitland's Dark Ages , which I enjoyed very much ;
La Croix on the Customs of the Middle Ages , 16 chapters of Bryce and liked it more and more ;
more chapters of Guizot ;
Lecky and Stanley's Eastern Church .</s>

<s>she discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone .</s>

<s>Lucy's correspondence with brother Winslow during his college days was not entirely taken up with academic studies .</s>

<s>she played chess with him by postcard .</s>

<s>also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in importunately .</s>

<s>who won is not revealed , but Winslow's daughter Eleanor says they got up to 1,212 words .</s>

<s>there was another family interest also .</s>

<s>Winslow had musical talents , as had his father before him .</s>

<s>at different times he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist .</s>

<s>and it was Lucy Upton who first started the idea of a regular course in Music at Spelman College .</s>

<s>Winslow Upton after graduation from Brown University and two years of graduate study , accepted a position at the Harvard Observatory .</s>

<s>for three years he was connected with the U.S.</s>

<s>Naval Observatory and with the U.S. Signal Corps ;
and after 1883 , was professor of astronomy at Brown University .</s>

<s>the six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun , of which he was a member , took him to Colorado , Virginia , and California as well as to the South Pacific and to Russia .</s>

<s>after her father's death , Lucy and her youngest sister lived for a few years with Winslow in Washington , D.C. .</s>

<s>their house , writes Albert S. Flint , was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer , especially grateful to one like myself far from home .</s>

<s>Lucy was a lively part of the household .</s>

<s>moreover , she had physical as well as mental vigor .</s>

<s>Winslow , as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall , used to characterize her as our iron sister .</s>

<s>there is reason to suppose that Lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about to enter college .</s>

<s>as a matter of fact , Albert S. Flint expressed his conviction that her physical strength , her mental power , her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings would have led her to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country .</s>

<s>while in Washington , D.C. , Lucy Upton held positions in the U.S. Census Office , and in the Pension Bureau .</s>

<s>they were not sufficiently challenging however , and she resigned in 1887 , to go to Germany with her brother Winslow and his family while he was there on study .</s>

<s>after the months in Europe , she returned to Boston and became active in church and community life .</s>

<s>what was called an accidental meeting with Miss Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman .</s>

<s>here was a cause she believed in .</s>

<s>after correspondence with Miss Packard and to the joy of Miss Packard and Miss Giles , she came to Atlanta , in the fall of 1888 , to help wherever needed , although there was then no money available to pay her a salary .</s>

<s>she served for a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance .</s>

<s>her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students ;
of her great power of discernment ;
of her exquisiteness of dress , her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts of the hearers ;
her great love of flowers and plants and birds ;
and her close knowledge of individual students .</s>

<s>she drew on all her resources of mind and heart to help them -- to make them at home in the world ;
and as graduates gratefully recall , she drew on her purse as well .</s>

<s>many a student was able to remain at Spelman , only because of her unobtrusive help .</s>

<s>under Miss Upton , the work of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption .</s>

<s>after all , she had come to Spelman Seminary in 1888 , and had been since 1891 except for one year , Associate Principal or Dean .</s>

<s>she had taught classes in botany , astronomy ( with the aid of a telescope ) , geometry , and psychology .</s>

<s>Miss Upton and Miss Packard , as a matter of fact , had many tastes in common .</s>

<s>both had eager and inquiring minds ;
and both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the development of sturdy character and Christian zeal .</s>

<s>both loved the out-of-doors , including mountain climbing and horseback riding .</s>

<s>in 1890 when the trip to Europe and the Holy Land was arranged for Miss Packard , it was Miss Upton who planned the trip , and with rare executive ability bore the brunt of the entire pilgrimage from beginning to end .</s>

<s>so strenuous it was physically , with its days of horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance for both Miss Packard and Miss Upton .</s>

<s>yet they thrived on it .</s>

<s>at the Fifteenth Anniversary ( 1896 ) as already quoted , Miss Upton projected with force and eloquence the Spelman of the Future as a college of first rank , with expanding and unlimited horizons .</s>

<s>when Dr. Wallace Buttrick , wise in his judgment of people , declined to have the Science Building named for him , he wrote Miss Tapley ( April 7 , 1923 ) if you had asked me , I think I would have suggested that you name the building for Miss Upton .</s>

<s>her services to the School for many years were of a very high character , and I have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her .</s>

<s>such were the qualities of the Acting-President of the Seminary after the death of Miss Giles .</s>

<s>at the meeting of the Board of Trustees , on March 3 , 1910 , Miss Upton presented the annual report of the President .</s>

<s>she noted that no student had been withdrawn through loss of confidence ;
that the enrollment showed an increase of boarding students as was desired ;
and that the year's work had gone forward smoothly .</s>

<s>she urged the importance of more thorough preparation for admission .</s>

<s>the raising of the $25,000 Improvement Fund two days before the time limit expired , and the spontaneous praise demonstration held afterward on the campus , were reported as events which had brought happiness to Miss Giles .</s>

<s>with the Fund in hand , the debt on the boilers had been paid ;
Rockefeller and Packard Halls had been renovated ;
walks laid ;
and ground had been broken for the superintendent's home .</s>

<s>Miss Upton spoke gratefully of the response of Spelman graduates and Negro friends in helping to raise the Fund , and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed current expenses .</s>

<s>she spoke also with deep thankfulness of the many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the years had made the work so fruitful in results .</s>

<s>two bequests were recorded : one of $200 under the will of Mrs. Harriet A. Copp of Los Angeles ;
and one of $2,000 under the will of Miss Celia L. Brett of Hamilton , New York , a friend from the early days .</s>

<s>Miss Upton told the Trustees that the death of Miss Giles was the sorest grief the Seminary had ever been called upon to bear .</s>

<s>the daughters of Spelman , she said , had never known or thought of Spelman without her .</s>

<s>the removal of Miss Packard 18 years earlier had caused them great sorrow , but they still had Miss Giles .</s>

<s>now the school was indeed bereft .</s>

<s>yet Spelman has strong , deep roots , and will live for the blessing of generations to come .</s>

<s>Miss Mary Jane Packard , Sophia's half-sister , became ill in March , 1910 ;
and when school closed , she was unable to travel to Massachusetts .</s>

<s>she remained in Atlanta through June and July ;
she died on August sixth .</s>

<s>before coming on a visit to Spelman in 1885 , Miss Mary had been a successful teacher in Worcester , and her position there was held open for her for a considerable period .</s>

<s>but she decided to stay at Spelman .</s>

<s>she helped with teaching as well as office work for a few years -- the catalogues show that she had classes in geography , rhetoric and bookkeeping .</s>

<s>soon the office work claimed all her time .</s>

<s>she was closely associated with the Founders in all their trials and hardships .</s>

<s>quiet and energetic , cheerful and calm , she too was a power in the development of the seminary .</s>

<s>Miss Giles always used to refer to her as Sister .</s>

<s>she served as secretary in the Seminary office for 25 years , and was in charge of correspondence , records , and bookkeeping .</s>

<s>the books of the school hold a memorial to her ;
and so do the hearts of students and of teachers .</s>

<s>Mary J. Packard , states a Messenger editorial , was efficient , pains-taking , self-effacing , loving , radiating the spirit of her Master .</s>

<s>with infinite patience she responded to every call , no matter at what cost to herself , and to her all went , for she was sure to have the needed information or word of cheer .</s>

<s>in a few school districts one finds a link between school and job .</s>

<s>in those vocational programs organized with Smith-Hughes money , there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other .</s>

<s>in these cases a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program , saving a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12 .</s>

<s>the apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis , usually at night , perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high school .</s>

<s>these opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such crafts as auto mechanics , carpentry , drafting , electrical work , tool-and-die work , and sheet-metal work .</s>

<s>formally organized vocational programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation .</s>

<s>the diversified occupations program is a part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employers .</s>

<s>the distributive education program operates in a similar way , with arrangements between the school and employers in merchandising fields .</s>

<s>in both cases the student attends school half-time and works in a regular job the other half .</s>

<s>he receives remuneration for his work .</s>

<s>in a few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student , while still in school , to develop skills which are immediately marketable upon graduation .</s>

<s>adult education courses , work-study programs of various sorts -- these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth .</s>

<s>in general , however , it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school , the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next .</s>

<s>if the student drops out of high school , the break with the school is even more complete .</s>

<s>when there is employment opportunity for youth , this arrangement -- or lack of arrangement -- works out quite well .</s>

<s>indeed , in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work .</s>

<s>statistically this has represented a loss to the nation , although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one .</s>

<s>I make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business which he entered .</s>

<s>he may or may not be better off than his classmate who went on to a college and professional school .</s>

<s>but in the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent .</s>

<s>in a later chapter dealing with the suburban school , I shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high school where he is found .</s>

<s>in the Negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation .</s>

<s>high motivation towards higher education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work .</s>

<s>undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools .</s>

<s>however , the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual .</s>

<s>and the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership .</s>

<s>this is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the Northern universities .</s>

<s>quite the contrary , as I can testify from personal experience as a former university president .</s>

<s>rather we see here another vicious circle .</s>

<s>the absence of successful Negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among Negro youth for academic careers .</s>

<s>I believe the situation is improving , but the success stories need to be heavily publicized .</s>

<s>here again we run into the roadblock that Negroes do not like to be designated as Negroes in the press .</s>

<s>how can the vicious circle be broken ?</s>

<s>this is a problem to which leaders of opinion , both Negro and white , should devote far more attention .</s>

<s>it is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the South .</s>

<s>vocational education
I should like to underline four points I made in my first report with respect to vocational education .</s>

<s>first and foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation .</s>

<s>second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the student's time in those years ;
however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to begin earlier .</s>

<s>third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ;
they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time .</s>

<s>fourth , the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality .</s>

<s>this last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears .</s>

<s>vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable skill becomes just another school chore for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter .</s>

<s>those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience .</s>

<s>I have been using the word vocational as a layman would at first sight think it should be used .</s>

<s>I intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls .</s>

<s>these courses develop skills other than those we think of when we use the adjective academic .</s>

<s>practically all of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill .</s>

<s>they are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high school .</s>

<s>to be sure , in tool-and-die work and in the building trades , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two years of half-time vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status .</s>

<s>similarly , a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community college or secretarial school .</s>

<s>of course , it can be argued that an ability to write English correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill .</s>

<s>so , too , is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics .</s>

<s>in a sense almost all high school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation ( which may be a profession ) will be called upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained .</s>

<s>in spite of the shading of one type of course into another , I believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses .</s>

<s>perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which proves the rule .</s>

<s>today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing , as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work in college and a professional school .</s>

<s>most of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools .</s>

<s>in this respect , public education in the large cities differs from education in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts .</s>

<s>the neighborhood high schools are not , strictly speaking , comprehensive schools , because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high school instead of the local school .</s>

<s>indeed , one school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city , because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs .</s>

<s>he prefers to designate such schools as high schools .</s>

<s>the suburban high school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational programs .</s>

<s>the reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community .</s>

<s>therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school described in my first report .</s>

<s>the separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions .</s>

<s>by and large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system .</s>

<s>it is not often realized to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment , except for a lucky few .</s>

<s>one has to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a boy cannot just say , I want to be a plumber , and then , by doing good work , find a job .</s>

<s>it is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation .</s>

<s>two stories will illustrate what I have in mind .</s>

<s>one vocational instructor in a city vocational school , speaking of his course in a certain field , said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city .</s>

<s>in the city , he said , the waiting list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside track he can't get in .</s>

<s>in a far distant part of the United States , I was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special work .</s>

<s>what does he have in mind to do when he graduates ?</s>

<s>oh , he'll be a plumber , came the answer .</s>

<s>but isn't it almost impossible to get into the union ?</s>

<s>I asked .</s>

<s>he'll have no difficulty , I was told .</s>

<s>he has very good connections .</s>

<s>in my view , there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city .</s>

<s>ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest .</s>

<s>an excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high school is the Dunbar Vocational High School in Chicago .</s>

<s>located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment , this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students .</s>

<s>hardly a window has been broken since Dunbar first was opened ( and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many slum areas ) .</s>

<s>I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were Negroes .</s>

<s>they were learning trades as diverse as shoe repairing , bricklaying , carpentry , cabinet making , auto mechanics , and airplane mechanics .</s>

<s>the physical facilities at Dunbar are impressive , but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils .</s>

<s>the soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the world .</s>

<s>in the United States , where half of the world crop is grown , soybeans are processed for their edible oil .</s>

<s>the residue from soybean processing goes mainly into animal feeds .</s>

<s>soybeans are extensively processed into a remarkable number of food products in the Orient .</s>

<s>American chemists , seeking to increase exports of soybeans , have adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their use in such traditional Japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh of Indonesia .</s>

<s>soybean flour , grits , flakes , milk , and curd can be bought in the United States .</s>

<s>peanuts are the world's second most important legume .</s>

<s>they are used mainly for their oil .</s>

<s>we produce peanut oil , but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed .</s>

<s>blanched peanuts , as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating as nuts , are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off .</s>

<s>cereal grains , supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans , comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of Asia and Africa .</s>

<s>in western Europe and North America , where the level of economic development is higher , grains and other seed products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed .</s>

<s>rather , meat and potatoes , sugar , and dairy products are the main sources of carbohydrate , protein , oils , and fats .</s>

<s>people depend less on seeds for foods in Australia , New Zealand , and Argentina , where extensive grazing lands support sheep or cattle , and the consumption of meat is high .</s>

<s>feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world's cereal crop in 1957-1958 .</s>

<s>most of the grain is fed to swine and dairy cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and poultry .</s>

<s>about 90 percent of the corn used in the United States is fed to animals .</s>

<s>the rest is used for human food and industrial products .</s>

<s>more than half of the sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock .</s>

<s>more than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products are fed to livestock annually in the United States .</s>

<s>the efficiency with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily in the United States since the 1930's and has paralleled the increased feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds are processed for oil .</s>

<s>the demand for food is so great in the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood crops .</s>

<s>seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor position .</s>

<s>chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial uses are the oil-bearing seeds -- flax , castor , tung ( nuts from the China wood-oil tree ) , perilla ( from an Oriental mint ) , and oiticica ( from a Brazilian tree ) .</s>

<s>oils , or liquid fats , from the seeds of flax and tung have long been the principal constituents of paints and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces of wood and metal .</s>

<s>these oils develop hard , smooth films when they dry and form resinlike substances .</s>

<s>the artist who paints in oil uses drying oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the ages .</s>

<s>one of the finest of artists' oils comes from poppy seeds .</s>

<s>seeds of soybean , cotton , corn , sesame , and rape yield semidrying oils .</s>

<s>some are used in paints along with drying oils .</s>

<s>palm oil protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin .</s>

<s>castor oil , made from castorbeans , has gone out of style as a medicine .</s>

<s>this nondrying oil , however , is now more in demand than ever before as a fine lubricant , as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically operated equipment , and as a source of chemicals to make plastics .</s>

<s>almond oil , another nondrying oil , was once used extensively in perfumery to extract flower fragrances .</s>

<s>it is still used in drugs and cosmetics , but it is rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with oils from peach and plum seeds .</s>

<s>liquid fats from all these oilseeds enter into the manufacture of soaps for industry and the household and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making explosives .</s>

<s>sizable amounts of soybean , coconut , and palm kernel oil -- seed oils that are produced primarily for food purposes -- also are used to make soaps , detergents , and paint resins .</s>

<s>solid fats from the seeds of the mahua tree , the shea tree , and the coconut palm are used to make candles in tropical countries .</s>

<s>seeds are a main source of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world .</s>

<s>corn and wheat supply most of the starch in the United States , Canada , and Australia .</s>

<s>in other countries where cereal grains are not among the principal crops of a region , starchy tubers or roots are processed for starch .</s>

<s>starch is used in the paper , textile , and food-processing industries and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations .</s>

<s>gums were extracted from quince , psyllium ( fleawort ) , flax , and locust ( carob ) seeds in ancient times .</s>

<s>today the yearly import into the United States of locust bean gum is more than 15 million pounds ;
of psyllium seed , more than 2.6 million .</s>

<s>the discovery during the Second World War that guar gum was similar to imported locust gum increased its cultivation in western Asia and initiated it in the United States .</s>

<s>water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs and in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners , stabilizers , or dispersing agents .</s>

<s>guar gum thickens salad dressings and stabilizes ice cream .</s>

<s>quince seed gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting lotions .</s>

<s>once regarded as an agricultural nuisance , psyllium was sold in the 1930's as a mechanical laxative under 117 different brands .</s>

<s>locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers in making paper .</s>

<s>the seeds of hard , fibrous , stony fruits , called nuts , provide highly concentrated foods , oils , and other materials of value .</s>

<s>most nuts consist of the richly packaged storage kernel and its thick , adherent , brown covering -- the seedcoat .</s>

<s>the kernels of brazil nuts , cashews , coconuts , filberts , hazelnuts , hickory nuts , pecans , walnuts , and pine nuts are predominantly oily .</s>

<s>almonds and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein .</s>

<s>chestnuts are starchy .</s>

<s>all nut kernels are rich in protein .</s>

<s>the world production of familiar seed nuts -- almonds , brazil nuts , filberts , and the English walnuts -- totals about 300 thousand tons annually .</s>

<s>coconuts , the fruit of the coconut palm , have the largest of all known seeds and are grown in South Pacific islands as a crop for domestic and export markets .</s>

<s>the oil palm of West Africa yields edible oil from both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit .</s>

<s>world production of copra , the oil-bearing flesh of the coconut , was a little more than 3 million tons in 1959 .</s>

<s>exports from producing countries in terms of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million tons , about half of which was palm kernels or oil from them and about half was palm oil .</s>

<s>other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include the spicy nutmeg ;
the soap nut , which owes its sudsing power to natural saponins ;
the marking nut , used for ink and varnish ;
the aromatic sassafras nut of South America ;
and the sweet-smelling cumara nut , which is suited for perfumes .</s>

<s>a forest crop that has not been extensively cultivated is ivory nuts from the tagua palm .</s>

<s>the so-called vegetable ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized seed .</s>

<s>it is used for making buttons and other small , hard objects of turnery .</s>

<s>seeds of the sago palm are used in Bermuda to make heads and faces of dolls sold to tourists .</s>

<s>the color and shape of seeds have long made them attractive for ornaments and decorations .</s>

<s>since Biblical times , rosaries have been made from jobs-tears -- the seeds of an Asiatic grass .</s>

<s>bead tree seeds are the necklaces of South Pacific islanders and the eyes of Buddha dolls in Cuba .</s>

<s>Victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry .</s>

<s>handmade Christmas wreaths and trees often contain a variety of seeds collected during the year .</s>

<s>tradition has assigned medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids , aromatic oils , and highly flavored components .</s>

<s>although science has given us more effective materials , preparations from anise , castorbean , colchicum , nux vomica , mustard , fennel , and stramonium are familiar to many for the relief of human ailments .</s>

<s>flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still are used by some persons .</s>

<s>peanut and sesame oils often are used as carriers or diluents for medicines administered by injection .</s>

<s>still another group of seeds ( sometimes tiny , dry , seed-bearing fruits ) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods , although the nutrients they supply are quite negligible .</s>

<s>the common spices , flavorings , and condiments make up this group .</s>

<s>each year millions of pounds of anise , caraway , mustard , celery , and coriander and the oils extracted from them are imported .</s>

<s>single-seeded dry fruits used for flavoring include several of the carrot family , such as cumin , dill , fennel , and angelica .</s>

<s>less common seeds used in cooking and beverages include fenugreek ( artificial maple flavor ) and cardamom .</s>

<s>white pepper is the ground seed of the common black pepper fruit .</s>

<s>sesame seed , which comes from the tall pods of a plant grown in Egypt , Brazil , and Central America , has a toasted-nut flavor and can be used in almost any dish calling for almonds .</s>

<s>it is a main flavoring for halvah , the candy of the Middle East .</s>

<s>sesame sticks , a snack dip , originated in the Southwest .</s>

<s>beverages are made from seeds the world over .</s>

<s>coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds of the coffee tree .</s>

<s>world production of coffee broke all previous records in 1959 and 1960 at more than 5 million tons .</s>

<s>per capita consumption remains around 16 pounds in the United States .</s>

<s>cocoa , chocolate , and cocoa butter come from the ground seeds of the cacao tree .</s>

<s>world production of about 1 million tons is divided primarily between Africa ( 63 percent ) and South America ( 27 percent ) .</s>

<s>several soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts , the seed of the kola tree cultivated in the West Indies and South America .</s>

<s>cereal grains have been used for centuries to prepare fermented beverages .</s>

<s>the Japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain .</s>

<s>arrack is distilled from fermented rice in India .</s>

<s>beer , generally fermented from barley , is an old alcoholic beverage .</s>

<s>beer was brewed by the Babylonians and Egyptians more than 6 thousand years ago .</s>

<s>brewers today use corn , rice , and malted barley .</s>

<s>distillers use corn , malt , wheat , grain sorghum , and rye in making beverage alcohol .</s>

<s>seed crops hold a prominent place in the agricultural economy of the United States .</s>

<s>the farm value of seeds produced in this country for all purposes , including the cereals , is nearly 10 billion dollars a year .</s>

<s>cereal grains , oilseeds , and dry beans and peas account for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised .</s>

<s>the economic importance of seed crops actually is even greater , because additional returns are obtained from most of the corn , oats , barley , and sorghum -- as well as the cake and meal from the processing of flaxseed , cottonseed , and soybeans -- through conversion to poultry , meat , and dairy products .</s>

<s>seeds furnish about 40 percent of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock .</s>

<s>hay and pasture are the other chief sources of livestock feed .</s>

<s>seeds are the essential raw materials for milling grain , baking , crushing oilseed , refining edible oil , brewing , distilling , and mixing feed .</s>

<s>more than 11 thousand business establishments in the United States were based on cereals and oilseeds in 1954 .</s>

<s>the value of products from these industries was 15.8 billion dollars , of which about one-third was created by manufacturing processes .</s>

<s>not included was the value of seed oil in paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries that are based on imported seed or seed products .</s>

<s>cereal grains furnish about one-fourth of the total food calories in the American diet and about one-third of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock and poultry .</s>

<s>to hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home was called locatin' 'em .</s>

<s>to keep 'em scattered somewhat and yet herd 'em was called loose herdin' .</s>

<s>to hold 'em in a compact mass was close herdin' .</s>

<s>cattle were inclined to remain in a territory with which they were acquainted .</s>

<s>that became their home range .</s>

<s>yet there were always some that moved farther and farther out , seekin' grass and water .</s>

<s>these became strays , the term bein' restricted to cattle , however , as hosses , under like circumstances , were spoken of as stray hosses , not merely strays .</s>

<s>cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it was over .</s>

<s>you couldn't stop 'em ;

<s>such marchin' in wholesale numbers was called a drift , or winter drift , and if the storm was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the range .</s>

<s>the cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number of them animals .</s>

<s>the single animal or a small bunch were referred to as strays ;
but when a large number were bunched up or banded up , and marched away from their home range , as long as they stayed together the group was said to be a drift .</s>

<s>drifts usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds , but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or grass because of a drought , or as an aftermath of a stampede .</s>

<s>drifts usually happened only with cattle , for hosses had 'nough sense to avoid 'em , and to find shelter for 'emselves .</s>

<s>the wholesale death of cattle as a result of blizzards , and sometimes droughts , over a wide range of territory was called a die-up .</s>

<s>followin' such an event there was usually a harvest of fallen hides , and the ranchers needed skinnin' knives instead of brandin' irons .</s>

<s>cattle were said to be potted when blizzard choked , that is , caught in a corner or a draw , or against a drift fence durin' a storm .</s>

<s>cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as the winter kill .</s>

<s>when cattle in winter stopped and humped their backs up they were said to bow up .</s>

<s>this term was also used by the cowboy in the sense of a human showin' fight , as one cowhand was heard to say , he arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm .</s>

<s>cattle drove to the northern ranges and held for two winters to mature 'em into prime beef were said to be double wintered .</s>

<s>cattle brought into a range from a distance were called immigrants .</s>

<s>them new to the country were referred to as pilgrims .</s>

<s>this word was first applied to the imported hot-blooded cattle , but later was more commonly used as reference to a human tenderfoot .</s>

<s>Hereford cattle were often called white faces , or open-face cattle , and the old-time cowman gave the name of hothouse stock to them newly introduced cattle .</s>

<s>because Holstein cattle weren't a beef breed , they were rarely seen on a ranch , though one might be found now and then for the milk supply .</s>

<s>the cowboy called this breed of cattle magpies .</s>

<s>a cattaloe was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and cattle .</s>

<s>dry stock denoted , regardless of age or sex , such bovines as were givin' no milk .</s>

<s>a wet herd was a herd of cattle made up entirely of cows , while wet stuff referred to cows givin' milk .</s>

<s>the cowboy's humorous name for a cow givin' milk was a milk pitcher .</s>

<s>cows givin' no milk were knowed as strippers .</s>

<s>the terminology of the range , in speakin' of dry stock and wet stock , was confusin' to the tenderfoot .</s>

<s>the most common reference to wet stock was with the meanin' that such animals had been smuggled across the Rio Grande after bein' stolen from their rightful owners .</s>

<s>the term soon became used and applied to all stolen animals .</s>

<s>Mixed herd meant a herd of mixed sexes , while a straight steer herd was one composed entirely of steers , and when the cowman spoke of mixed cattle , he meant cattle of various grades , ages , and sexes .</s>

<s>in the spring when penned cattle were turned out to grass , this was spoken of as turn-out time , or put to grass .</s>

<s>shootin' 'em out was gettin' cattle out of a corral onto the range .</s>

<s>when a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin' run she was said to come out a-stoopin' .</s>

<s>to stir cattle up and get 'em heated and excited was to mustard the cattle , and the act was called ginnin' 'em 'round , or chousin' 'em .</s>

<s>after a roundup the pushin' of stray cattle of outside brands toward their home range was called throwin' over .</s>

<s>a cow rose from the ground rear end first .</s>

<s>by the time her hindquarters were in a standin' position , her knees were on the ground in a prayin' attitude .</s>

<s>it was when she was in this position that the name prayin' cow was suggested to the cowboy .</s>

<s>they were said to be on their heads when grazin' .</s>

<s>on the hoof was a reference to live cattle and was also used in referrin' to cattle travelin' by trail under their own power as against goin' by rail .</s>

<s>shippin' cattle by train was called a stock run .</s>

<s>a general classification given grass-fed cattle was grassers .</s>

<s>when a cowboy spoke of dustin' a cow , he meant that he throwed dust into her eyes .</s>

<s>the cow , unlike a bull or steer , kept her eyes open and her mind on her business when chargin' , and a cow on the prod or on the peck was feared by the cowhand more than any of his other charges .</s>

<s>the Injun's name for beef was wohaw , and many of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the Injun on the trails .</s>

<s>the first cattle the Injuns saw under the white man's control were the ox teams of the early freighters .</s>

<s>listenin' with wonder at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted whoa , haw , and Gee , they thought them words the names of the animals , and began callin' cattle wohaws .</s>

<s>rarely did a trail herd pass through the Injun country on its march north that it wasn't stopped to receive demand for wohaw .</s>

<s>tailin' was the throwin' of an animal by the tail in lieu of a rope .</s>

<s>any animal could when travelin' fast , be sent heels over head by the simple process of overtakin' the brute , seizin' its tail , and givin' the latter a pull to one side .</s>

<s>this throwed the animal off balance , and over it'd crash onto its head and shoulders .</s>

<s>though the slightest yank was frequently capable of producin' results , many men assured success through a turn of the tail 'bout the saddle horn , supplemented sometimes , in the case of cattle , by a downward heave of the rider's leg upon the strainin' tail .</s>

<s>such tactics were resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns , and a thorough tailin' usually knocked the breath out of a steer , and so dazed 'im that he'd behave for the rest of the day .</s>

<s>it required both a quick and swift hoss and a darin' rider .</s>

<s>when cattle became more valuable , ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was discontinued , at least when the boss was 'round .</s>

<s>when the cowboy used the word tailin's , he meant stragglers .</s>

<s>bull tailin' was a game once pop'lar with the Mexican cowboys of Texas .</s>

<s>from a pen of wild bulls one would be released , and with much yellin' a cowhand'd take after 'im .</s>

<s>seizin' the bull by the tail , he rushed his hoss forward and a little to one side , throwin' the bull off balance , and bustin' 'im with terrific force .</s>

<s>rammin' one horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold 'im down was called peggin' .</s>

<s>colors of cattle came in for their special names .</s>

<s>an animal covered with splotches or spots of different colors was called a brindle or brockle .</s>

<s>a lineback was an animal with a stripe of different color from the rest of its body runnin' down its back , while a lobo stripe was the white , yeller , or brown stripe runnin' down the back , from neck to tail , a characteristic of many Spanish cattle .</s>

<s>a mealynose was a cow or steer of the longhorn type , with lines and dots of a color lighter'n the rest of its body 'round the eyes , face , and nose .</s>

<s>such an animal was said to be mealynosed .</s>

<s>sabinas was a Spanish word used to describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin' .</s>

<s>the northern cowboy called all the red Mexican cattle which went up the trail Sonora reds , while they called all cattle drove up from Mexico yaks , because they came from the Yaqui Injun country , or gave 'em the name of Mexican buckskins .</s>

<s>near the southern border , cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration was black with a lineback , with white speckles frequently appearin' on the sides and belly , were called zorrillas .</s>

<s>this word was from the Spanish , meanin' polecat .</s>

<s>yeller bellies were cattle of Mexican breed splotched on flank and belly with yellerish color .</s>

<s>an animal with distinct coloration , or other marks easily distinguished and remembered by the owner and his riders , was sometimes used as a marker .</s>

<s>such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the rustler .</s>

<s>countin' each grazin' bunch of cattle where it was found on the range and driftin' it back so that it didn't mix with the uncounted cattle was called a range count .</s>

<s>the countin' of cattle in a pasture without throwin' 'em together for the purpose was called a pasture count .</s>

<s>the counters rode through the pasture countin' each bunch of grazin' cattle , and drifted it back so that it didn't get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead .</s>

<s>this method of countin' was usually done at the request , and in the presence , of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the herd .</s>

<s>them notes and mortgages were spoken of as cattle paper .</s>

<s>a book count was the sellin' of cattle by the books , commonly resorted to in the early days , sometimes much to the profit of the seller .</s>

<s>this led to the famous sayin' in the Northwest of the books won't freeze .</s>

<s>this became a common byword durin' the boom days when Eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle interests .</s>

<s>the origin of this sayin' was credited to a saloonkeeper by the name of Luke Murrin .</s>

<s>his saloon was a meetin' place for influential Wyoming cattlemen , and one year durin' a severe blizzard , when his herd-owner customers were wearin' long faces , he said , cheer up , boys , whatever happens , the books won't freeze .</s>

<s>in this carefree sentence he summed up the essence of the prevailin' custom of buyin' by book count , and created a sayin' which has survived through the years .</s>

<s>range delivery meant that the buyer , after examinin' the seller's ranch records and considerin' his rep'tation for truthfulness , paid for what the seller claimed to own , then rode out and tried to find it .</s>

<s>when a cowhand said that a man had good cow sense , he meant to pay 'im a high compliment .</s>

<s>no matter by what name cattle were called , there was no denyin' that they not only saved Texas from financial ruin , but went far toward redeemin' from a wilderness vast territories of the Northwest .</s>

<s>21 swingin' a wide loop
the first use of the word rustler was as a synonym for hustler , becomin' an established term for any person who was active , pushin' , and bustlin' in any enterprise .</s>

<s>again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler , and when the order was given to go out and rustle the hosses , it meant for 'im to go out and herd 'em in .</s>

<s>eventually herdin' the hosses was spoken of as hoss rustlin' , and the wrangler was called the hoss rustler .</s>

<s>later , the word became almost exclusively applied to a cow thief , startin' from the days of the maverick when cowhands were paid by their employers to get out and rustle a few mavericks .</s>

<s>it was John who found the lion tracks .</s>

<s>he found them near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the night before , and he circled once , nose to the ground , hair shooting up along his back , as it did when he was after lion or bear , and then he lifted his head and bayed , and the pack joined in , all heads high , and Jones knew it was a hot trail .</s>

<s>he stifled the Comanche yell and let John lead him straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain .</s>

<s>this mountain was known as The Black Reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about two hundred feet , honeycombed with caves , top covered with dense scrub and creepers and tall grass .</s>

<s>on the south it ended sharply as though the lava had been cut off there suddenly .</s>

<s>Kearton and Ulyate had started the day together while Jones followed the dogs , and Means and Loveless had taken another route , and now , with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to him , Ulyate reined in , in the shadow of the Reef and pointed .</s>

<s>Kearton focussed his field glasses .</s>

<s>that's the Colonel , he said , but I can't see the dogs .</s>

<s>as they watched , Jones rode straight for the Reef .</s>

<s>then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front of him .</s>

<s>the dogs were working a trail -- lion ?</s>

<s>hyena ?</s>

<s>the pack had made a bend to the north , swinging back toward the Reef , and Kearton and Ulyate could hear them faintly .</s>

<s>Kearton got off and tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring Loveless and Means and the rest of the party .</s>

<s>not yet , cautioned Ulyate .</s>

<s>Jones came toward them fast , now , along the southern toe of the Reef , and the dogs could be heard plainly , Old John with his Grand Canyon voice outstanding above the others .</s>

<s>there was Sounder , too , also a veteran of the North Rim , and Rastus and the Rake from a pack of English fox-hounds , and a collie from a London pound , and Simba , a terrier .</s>

<s>a motley pack , chosen for effectiveness , not beauty .</s>

<s>Jones was galloping close behind them leaning down , cheering them on .</s>

<s>light it ]
Ulyate said , and Kearton touched a match to the pile of grass , blew on it and flame licked out .</s>

<s>he threw green stuff on it , and a thin blue column of smoke rose .</s>

<s>that will fetch the gang and tell the Colonel where we are .</s>

<s>two quick shots sounded .</s>

<s>then there was a chorus of wild barking and baying .</s>

<s>then the heavy roar of a lion .</s>

<s>Kearton and Ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound .</s>

<s>it came from the top of the Reef not half a mile away .</s>

<s>at the base of the rocky hillside , they left their horses and climbed on foot .</s>

<s>the route was choked with rugged lava-rocks , creepers and bushes , so thickly overgrown that when Kearton lost sight of Ulyate and called , Ulyate answered from ten feet away .</s>

<s>nice country to meet a lion in face to face .</s>

<s>Ulyate and Kearton climbed on toward the sound of the barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion , till they came , out of breath , to the crest , and peering through the branches of a bush , this is what Ulyate saw : Jones who had apparently ( and actually had ) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside , sitting calmly on his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness , who was crouched on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him , while the dogs whirled around her .</s>

<s>Ulyate drew back with a start , and put finger to lips , almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her off , the dogs have got her bayed .</s>

<s>she's just the other side of that bush ]
and when they had drawn back a step he added : Jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her .</s>

<s>why she doesn't charge him , I don't know .</s>

<s>and he hasn't even got a knife on him .</s>

<s>he couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground .</s>

<s>careful , don't disturb her .</s>

<s>Jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the Reef .</s>

<s>she was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when she saw him she rose to full height and roared , opening her mouth wide , lashing her tail , and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in irritation , as much as to say : how dare you disturb me in my sacred precinct ?</s>

<s>intuition told him , however , that she was tired and winded from the run up the Reef and would not charge , yet .</s>

<s>he moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her , being careful , because he knew the female is less predictable than the male .</s>

<s>( in the graveyard at Nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso .</s>

<s>of the thirty-four , seventeen had been killed by lions , and eleven out of the seventeen by lionesses .
)</s>

<s>she snarled terribly but intuition told him , again , that she was bluffing , and he could see that half her attention was distracted by the dogs .</s>

<s>he threw the lasso .</s>

<s>it was falling over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front of her on the rock .</s>

<s>even then , if she took one step forward he could catch her .</s>

<s>but John nipped her rear end -- one lion's rear end was as good as another to John , Africa , Arizona no matter -- and she changed ends and took a swipe at John , but he ducked back .</s>

<s>Jones then recoiled his rope and threw again , this time hitting her on the back but failing to encircle her .</s>

<s>she whirled and faced him , roaring terribly , and Ulyate , watching through the leaves , could not understand why she did not charge and obliterate him , because he wouldn't have much of a chance of getting away , in that thick growth , but she seemed just a trace uncertain ;
while Jones , on the other hand , appeared perfectly confident and Ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer .</s>

<s>from the lioness' point of view , this strange creature on the back of another creature , lashing out with its long thin paw , very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with .</s>

<s>but now she sank lower to the rock .</s>

<s>her roar changed to a growl .</s>

<s>her tail no longer lashed .</s>

<s>although she appeared more subdued and defeated , Jones knew she was growing more dangerous .</s>

<s>she was rested and could mount a charge .</s>

<s>just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched , and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet .</s>

<s>at this moment , Loveless and Means arrived , crashing through the undergrowth with their horses , and distracted her , and she ran off a short distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks .</s>

<s>the dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded Old John .</s>

<s>we've got to get her out of there ]
Jones yelled , or she'll kill 'em all .</s>

<s>bring me the firecrackers .</s>

<s>for such an emergency he had included Fourth-of-July cannon crackers as part of their equipment .</s>

<s>lighting one he pitched it into the crevice , and the lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed .</s>

<s>ain't she a beauty , though ?</s>

<s>called out Means as she ran .</s>

<s>don't you go a step nearer her than I do , Jones warned , and if you do , go at a run so you'll have momentum ]
for two hours they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of the Reef , trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get a good throw .</s>

<s>but she clung to the rocks and brush , and the day wore away .</s>

<s>it was hot .</s>

<s>the dogs were tired .</s>

<s>the men were tired too .</s>

<s>it was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again .</s>

<s>and the sun was beginning to go down .</s>

<s>if dark came they would lose her .</s>

<s>I'll get a pole , Jones said finally , and I'll poke a noose over her head ]
at this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture halfway down the Reef .</s>

<s>Ulyate made no comment but his face showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions' heads with poles , and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago , not the gentler ones of today , and this one was angry , with good reason .</s>

<s>Loveless , too , objected .</s>

<s>it won't work , Colonel .</s>

<s>just the same we'll try it .</s>

<s>but without waiting for them to try it , she scattered the dogs and shot down the Reef and out across the plain .</s>

<s>John led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out behind , many of them trailing blood .</s>

<s>John himself was bruised and clawed from head to tail , but he was in this fight to the finish , running almost as strongly now as in the morning .</s>

<s>she took refuge on a tongue of land extending into a gully , crouched at the base of a thorn tree , and waited for them to come up .</s>

<s>she had chosen the spot well .</s>

<s>with the gully on three sides , she could be approached only along the tongue of land .</s>

<s>careful , now , Jones warned .</s>

<s>Means tried her first .</s>

<s>very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding , edging closer , watching for a chance to throw , but ready to spin and run , rope whining about his head , horse edging tensely under him , but the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close proximity of the lion .</s>

<s>they tell you horses go crazy at the sight or smell of a bear or a lion , but these didn't .</s>

<s>Means edged closer .</s>

<s>she snarled warningly .</s>

<s>means spit and edged on .</s>

<s>again she snarled , and again he edged .</s>

<s>the pony was sidewise to her .</s>

<s>with a whirling jump , it could get into gear .</s>

<s>however nothing on four legs was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance , unless it was a cheetah .</s>

<s>she charged .</s>

<s>Means spun and spurred .</s>

<s>for thirty yards she gained rapidly .</s>

<s>she was closing and within one more bound would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay , but -- and here Jones and Loveless and Ulyate were holding breath for all they were worth -- she never quite caught up that last bound .</s>

<s>Means held steady one jump ahead of her .</s>

<s>then gradually he began to pull away .</s>

<s>a Western cowpony had outrun an African lion , from a standing start .</s>

<s>photos showed later that she'd been about six feet from Means .</s>

<s>of course the factor of head start made all the difference .</s>

<s>how much head start ?</s>

<s>no one knew exactly .</s>

<s>that was the whole question .</s>

<s>enough , was the answer .</s>

<s>the lioness quickly changed front , when she saw she couldn't catch Means , and made for Jones .</s>

<s>as she had done with Means , she gained rapidly at first , but then Baldy began to draw away .</s>

<s>somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the determining point .</s>

<s>when Jones too drew away , she returned to a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully , crouched low and waited as before .</s>

<s>this new position , however , gave the ropers a better chance .</s>

<s>there was room to make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went .</s>

<s>so : Means edged around on the north side of her , Jones moved in from the south .</s>

<s>tossing his rope and shouting he attracted her attention .</s>

<s>he succeeded almost too well , because once she rose as if to charge , and he half wheeled his horse -- he was within fifty feet -- but she sank back .</s>

<s>from behind her Means shot forward at a run .</s>

<s>Kearton began shouting , wait , wait -- the camera's jammed ]
but Means kept on .</s>

<s>he raced by within twenty feet of her , roped her around the neck , but a lioness' neck is short and thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off .</s>

<s>the missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies .</s>

<s>but the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life .</s>

<s>the Christian education of children , too , was once hardly more than a sideshow , but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty .</s>

<s>the most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives .</s>

<s>most pastors and laymen , even though they believe it to be important , assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes .</s>

<s>they may even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the ecclesiastical Rover Boys , as someone has dubbed them , who like to go to national and international assemblies , and have expense accounts that permit them to do so .</s>

<s>as long as this point of view prevails , the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt .</s>

<s>the next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community .</s>

<s>progress will take place far less through what is done in any summit conference of the National Council or the World Council , or even in offices of the denominational boards , than through what happens in the communities where Christian people live together as neighbors .</s>

<s>the front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping congregations of different traditions exist side by side .</s>

<s>until they see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes , programs , and relationships , it will have an inevitable aspect of unreality .</s>

<s>as things now stand , there is a grievous disparity between the unity in Christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any Main Street in the nation .</s>

<s>the ecumenical congregation
the crux of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation between congregations in the same community .</s>

<s>the decisive question is what happens within each congregation and , finally , in the minds and hearts of the individual members .</s>

<s>it is here that the local and ecumenical must meet .</s>

<s>it is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical .</s>

<s>it has become almost trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be carried down to the grass roots .</s>

<s>this way of describing the matter is unfortunate .</s>

<s>it implies two misconceptions .</s>

<s>one is that whatever is ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization at the top and needs only to be understood at the so-called lower levels .</s>

<s>the truth , however , is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole People of God throughout the world .</s>

<s>the other misconception is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its interdenominational connections , now comprehended by many national leaders , can be communicated to all congregations .</s>

<s>however needed this may be , the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of Christ in the world .</s>

<s>the basic unit in the church , of whatever denominational polity , is always the congregation .</s>

<s>it is hardly possible to emphasize this too much .</s>

<s>most people do not realize that the congregation , as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face , personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another , is unique .</s>

<s>the idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken .</s>

<s>the Jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the Christian congregation , but Hinduism , Buddhism , Islam , Confucianism , Taoism , Shintoism , although they have sacred scriptures , priests , spiritual disciplines , and places of prayer , do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love .</s>

<s>their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship .</s>

<s>how far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the New Testament means by koinonia ]
what is now called Christian fellowship is often little more than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind of people one likes .</s>

<s>the koinonia of Acts and of the Epistles means sharing in a common relation to Christ .</s>

<s>it is an experience of a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate indwelling of Christ in His people .</s>

<s>as Dietrich Bonhoffer puts it , our community with one another consists solely in what Christ has done to both of us .</s>

<s>this may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom , on the level of merely human agreeableness , we might prefer not to have any association at all .</s>

<s>there is a vast difference between the community of reconciliation which the New Testament describes and the community of congeniality found in the average church building .</s>

<s>whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal Church , in vital relation with the whole Body of Christ and participating in His mission to the world , a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid .</s>

<s>the antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists .</s>

<s>the local and the ecumenical are one .</s>

<s>of course , the perspective of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the People of God will always be different from the perspective of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a particular place .</s>

<s>each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other .</s>

<s>neither is adequate if it stands alone .</s>

<s>our difficulty arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other .</s>

<s>and this is what all too often happens .</s>

<s>divergent perspectives
a little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by Professor Bela Vasady at the end of the Second World War .</s>

<s>with great difficulty he made his way from his native Hungary to Geneva to renew his contacts as a member of the Provisional Committee for the World Council of Churches .</s>

<s>when he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles , his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones .</s>

<s>they were bifocals .</s>

<s>he often spoke of them as his ecumenical glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is required in the church .</s>

<s>it is , he said , a bifocal vision , which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a Christian in right relation to both .</s>

<s>as things stand now , the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other .</s>

<s>on the one hand , there are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town .</s>

<s>they do not escape the pitfall into which Charles Dickens pictured Mrs. Jellyby as falling .</s>

<s>her concern for the natives of Borrioboola-Gha was so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her son Peepy ]
likewise , the ecumenist may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in East Germany , the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary China , and the anguish of the church over apartheid in South Africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship , pastoral service and counseling , and Christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals .</s>

<s>on the other hand , many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering to the intimate , personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission .</s>

<s>as a result , they go on thinking of the church , with introverted and self-centered satisfaction , only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families .</s>

<s>it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches -- whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern -- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the members .</s>

<s>the parish lives for itself rather than for the community or the world .</s>

<s>the gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs .</s>

<s>it is eminently successful according to all conventional standards .</s>

<s>it is growing in numbers .</s>

<s>its people are agreeable friends .</s>

<s>it has a beautiful edifice .</s>

<s>its preaching and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain .</s>

<s>it provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled .</s>

<s>it helps children grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the Bible .</s>

<s>it draws young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation .</s>

<s>and it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is .</s>

<s>but what is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as Christians in the world ?</s>

<s>all too often its conception of parish ministry and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind .</s>

<s>it is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with the mind of Christ .</s>

<s>it is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy .</s>

<s>it is not making them sensitive to the sub-Christian level of much of our economic and industrial life .</s>

<s>it is raising no disturbing question as to what Christian stewardship means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world to economically underdeveloped peoples .</s>

<s>it is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in Asia and Africa .</s>

<s>to put it bluntly , many a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want .</s>

<s>it is not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian responsibility in relation to the world .</s>

<s>we shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of Christian witness and mission to the world .</s>

<s>there is a humorous but revealing story about a rancher who owned a large slice of Texas and who wanted to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant community .</s>

<s>he built a school and a library , then a recreation center and an inn .</s>

<s>desiring to fill the only remaining lack , he selected the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting it .</s>

<s>a visitor to the beautiful little building inquired , do you belong to this church , Mr. Rancher ?</s>

<s>why , no , ma'am , he replied , this church belongs to me ]
the story reflects the way too many people feel .</s>

<s>as long as the congregation regards the church as our church , or the minister thinks of it as my church , just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance .</s>

<s>there must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs not to us but to Christ , and that it is His purpose , not our own interests and preferences , that determines what it is to be and do .</s>

<s>local embodiment of the whole
a local church which conceives its function to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra , not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church .</s>

<s>it would doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really failing to be the Church of Christ .</s>

<s>Babe Ruth , as he always did in the Stadium , played right field to avoid having the sun in his eyes , and Tommy Thevenow , a rather mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals , knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers , where Ruth could not reach it .</s>

<s>the ordinary man and woman , however , saw little of the great professional games of those Golden Days , or of any other sporting event for that matter .</s>

<s>promoters always hastened to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators , and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance .</s>

<s>radio broadcasts , however -- now that even plain people could afford loud speakers on their sets -- held old fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones , chiefly women , who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition , became first inured , then attracted , then addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park .</s>

<s>in some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced , and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring .</s>

<s>this had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies , some of which began to offer special excursion rates , including seats at the park , just as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new .</s>

<s>while women had always attended ball games in small numbers ( it was the part of a dead game sport in the early years of the twentieth century to be taken out to the ball park and to root , root , root for the home team ) , they had often sat in patient martyrdom , unable even to read the scoreboard , which sometimes seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty-one .</s>

<s>the questions women asked at baseball games were standard grist for amateur comedy , as were the doings of women automobile drivers ;

<s>and women were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball .</s>

<s>radio , however , so increased the interest of women in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have Ladies' Days any longer to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home .</s>

<s>women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands , where they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears .</s>

<s>the radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative , despite the baseball jargon , that girls and women could begin to store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their lessons in school .</s>

<s>this conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the ideal , and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for preserving the ideal .</s>

<s>our discussion of this involves using Erik Erikson's schema of identity vs. identity diffusion as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted earlier .</s>

<s>our discussion does not utilize all the identity crises postulated by Erikson , but is intended to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying unwed mothers .</s>

<s>we hope thereby to emphasize that , from a psychological standpoint , the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy through adolescence .</s>

<s>hypothesizing a series of developmental stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old age , Erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series of identity crises .</s>

<s>the successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle -- during adolescence , the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity crisis depend , to a considerable degree , on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy , childhood , and early adolescence .</s>

<s>within Erikson's schema , the adolescent's delinquent behavior -- in this case , her unwed motherhood -- reflects her identity diffusion , or her inability to resolve these various identity crises positively .</s>

<s>the adolescent experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs. time diffusion .</s>

<s>time perspective -- the ability to plan for the future and to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range objectives -- is more easily developed if , from infancy on , the individual has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which she lives .</s>

<s>Erikson has noted that , unless this trust developed early , the time ambivalence experienced , in varying degree and temporarily , by all adolescents ( as a result of their remembering the more immediate gratification of wants during childhood , while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood ) may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion .</s>

<s>experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to act immediately .</s>

<s>these polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters .</s>

<s>some of these mothers , apparently feeling a desperate urgency , made , on the spur of the moment , commitments , in love and sex , that would have life-long consequences .</s>

<s>others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future .</s>

<s>for many of these unwed mothers , the data on their family life and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources of their basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in general .</s>

<s>however , as Erickson has noted , the individual's failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his ( or her ) adolescence .</s>

<s>and , as shown in Chapter 6 , some J females originally developed such trust only during their adolescence , through the aid of , and their identification with , alter-parents .</s>

<s>in the specific case of time diffusion , we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most ( if not all ) adolescents in our society , and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust .</s>

<s>the adolescent experiences two closely related crises : self-certainty vs. an identity consciousness ;
and role-experimentation vs. negative identity .</s>

<s>a sense of self-certainty and the freedom to experiment with different roles , or confidence in one's own unique behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity , is more easily developed during adolescence if , during early childhood , the individual was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some autonomy .</s>

<s>however , if the child has been constantly surrounded , during nursery and early school age , by peer groups ;
inculcated with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards ;
and allowed little initiative in early play and work patterns -- then in adolescence her normal degree of vanity , sensitivity , and preoccupation with whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable , will be compounded .</s>

<s>her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the manifestations , in her adolescence , of her having been indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame , if not guilt , for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to , and judged by , the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school peer friends .</s>

<s>to be different is to invite shame and doubt ;
and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's parents , who already consider one different and difficult to understand , than by one's peers , who are also experiencing a similar groping for and denial of adult status .</s>

<s>the attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in Chapter 2 , revealed both considerable preoccupation with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty .</s>

<s>many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others ;
but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and with one's self .</s>

<s>another identity crisis confronting the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs. work-paralysis .</s>

<s>the adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy , initiative , and self-discipline during childhood .</s>

<s>the developmental process involves the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed tasks , having kept commitments , and having created something ( however small or simple -- even a doll dress of one's own design rather than in the design it ought to be ) .</s>

<s>these childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs , for experimenting with many roles , and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities .</s>

<s>if she has not had such experiences , the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compounded .</s>

<s>she may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives -- e.g.</s>

<s>, whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker ;
whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school ;
whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school ;
and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study .</s>

<s>Erikson has noted that , as this indecision mounts , it may result in a paralysis of workmanship .</s>

<s>this paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting -- and never completing -- many jobs , tasks , and courses of study ;
and in the fact that she bases her decisions about work , college , carreer , and studies on what others are doing , rather than on her own sense of identity with given skills , abilities , likes , and dislikes .</s>

<s>the absence , during her childhood and early adolescence , of experiences in developing the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability -- experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement -- and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression , both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally in experimenting .</s>

<s>the comments made by some unwed mothers ( quoted in Chapter 2 ) reflect this paralysis of workmanship .</s>

<s>they attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made ;
they accepted a job primarily because it was available , convenient , and paid reasonably .</s>

<s>these things both express and , at the same time , continue contributing to , their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and self-certainty .</s>

<s>as their identity diffusion increased , they became more susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs .</s>

<s>these affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship , no sense of dignity derived from a job well done .</s>

<s>childhood experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of illegitimacy .</s>

<s>the excerpts from case histories presented above confirm this significance , though through different facets of experience .</s>

<s>for example , some unwed mothers had had no work experiences , household chores , and responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence ;
they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching for something exciting and diverting .</s>

<s>sex was both .</s>

<s>on the other hand , some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age , and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative , that their work and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens -- to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior .</s>

<s>the adolescent also faces the identity crisis that Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs. diffusion of ideals .</s>

<s>in discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy , we shall again superimpose Erikson's concept on our data .</s>

<s>adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize ideas and values , to perceive things as either-or , black or white -- nuances of meaning are relatively unimportant .</s>

<s>this tendency is , perhaps , most clearly revealed in the literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents .</s>

<s>Erikson has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood .</s>

<s>it provides identification -- with an idea , a value , a cause that cuts through , or even transcends , the multiple and ambivalent identities of their passage from child to adult , and permits their forceful and overt expression of emotion .</s>

<s>the positive development , during adolescence , of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence , and to identify overtly either with or against given ideas , values , and practices , depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy , initiative , and self-certainty .</s>

<s>most adolescents have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stages , as they experience a proliferation of ideas and values .</s>

<s>the diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed , however , in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty .</s>

<s>a pronounced ideological diffusion -- i.e.</s>

<s>, inability to identify independently given ideas and value systems -- is reflected in many ways .</s>

<s>for example , it is evinced by the adolescent ( or adult ) whose beliefs and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction against the ideas and behavior patterns of others , rather than his inner conviction and choice .</s>

<s>it is mirrored by the individual Willie Lohmans , whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment .</s>

<s>in another sense , it is represented in the arguments of the true believers who seek to disprove the validity of all other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs .</s>

<s>the case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion , embodied in the unwed mother's inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern , and her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior .</s>

<s>for example , the unwed mothers expressed their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly what it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly .</s>

<s>they were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual intercourse .</s>

<s>they condemned the movie script writers for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating .</s>

<s>they criticized parents for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong ;
and they censured parents who never disciplined and were too permissive or who never explained how easy it was to get pregnant .</s>

<s>in the adult world , there are a number of rather general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis .</s>

<s>for example , some contemporary writing tends to fuse the good guys and the bad guys , to portray the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue , and to explain ( or even justify ) asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic psychological , familial , and social experiences .</s>

<s>in the final accounting , these would have augmented the bill for both sides .</s>

<s>an estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive .</s>

<s>yet the huge amount of money consumed by the Selden litigation , which many regarded as wasteful , indirectly contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure .</s>

<s>the duration and other circumstances of the Selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of patent infringement actions .</s>

<s>the suit , as we have seen , came before the courts when patent attorneys , inventors , and laymen were making mounting demands for reforms in the American patent system .</s>

<s>chief among the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures in equity .</s>

<s>in a long and angry footnote to his opinion , Judge Hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism .</s>

<s>it is a duty , said Hough , not to let pass this opportunity of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony in Equity , current in this circuit ( and probably others ) , excused if not justified by the rules of the Supreme Court , especially to be found in patent causes , and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation .</s>

<s>as long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition , rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer , I fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged , and expensive prolixity remain the best known characteristic of Equity .</s>

<s>observing that reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible examples , Hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing procedures .</s>

<s>he cited the elephantine dimensions of the Selden case record ;
the duplication of testimony and exhibits ;
the numerous squabbles over minor matters ;
the objections stated at outrageous length ;
and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts , uncalled for and unjustifiable , from the retort discourteous to the lie direct .</s>

<s>the fundamental difficulty of which the Selden case was a striking ( though not singular ) example , concluded Hough , will remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial officer present , and responsible for the maintenance of discipline , and the reception or exclusion of testimony .</s>

<s>not least among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment were those who had participated in the Selden suit .</s>

<s>William A. Redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence , the testimony would have been completed in sixty days instead of five years .</s>

<s>inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for reform , inevitably centering upon the Selden litigation as a horrible example .</s>

<s>its costive deliberations were likened to those of the British courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by Dickens in Bleak House .</s>

<s>Parker , who agreed with much of this criticism , did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects .</s>

<s>but he felt that the Selden case was being unfairly pilloried .</s>

<s>in a detailed letter published in the Scientific American in 1912 , he remarked that loose statements about the case showed scant understanding of the facts .</s>

<s>the suit , although commonly designated as a single action , actually embraced five cases .</s>

<s>Parker insisted that the size of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication of testimony .</s>

<s>in a private communication written in 1911 , Parker had been more to the point .</s>

<s>noting the complaints of inventors and members of the patent bar , he admitted that some of the strictures were fairly well founded , but he added that under existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent .</s>

<s>the vast industrial interests caught up in the Selden suit , as well as the complex character of the automotive art , encouraged both sides to exploit every possible chance for or against the patent , said Parker .</s>

<s>this very seldom happens in this class or in other cases , and of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily would occur .</s>

<s>Parker listed the remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony .</s>

<s>the most important of these found him in agreement with Hough's plea for reform .</s>

<s>Parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court who had no authority to limit testimony .</s>

<s>the taking of depositions , he suggested , should be placed under a special court examiner empowered to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial testimony .</s>

<s>I am satisfied that in the Selden case had this power existed and this course ( been ) pursued , it would have shortened the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of the other witnesses thereto more than that .</s>

<s>in the end Hough's acidulous protest , which Parker called the now somewhat famous note on this Selden case , did not go unheeded .</s>

<s>in 1912 the United States Supreme Court adopted a new set of rules of equity which became effective on February 1 , 1913 .</s>

<s>the revised procedure was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform .</s>

<s>under the new rules , testimony is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary character .</s>

<s>other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity , limit delays , and reduce the expense of infringement suits .</s>

<s>one of the A.L.A.M.</s>

<s>lawyers observed that if the Selden case had been tried under this simplified procedure , the testimony which filled more than a score of volumes , at a minimum cost of $1 a page for publication alone , could have been contained in one volume .</s>

<s>while patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive forms of litigation , these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums of money .</s>

<s>there is little doubt that they were promulgated by the Supreme Court as a direct result of the Selden patent suit .</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>even before it was formally dissolved in 1912 , the A.L.A.M.</s>

<s>was succeeded by the Automobile Board of Trade , the direct lineal ancestor of the present-day Automobile Manufacturers Association .</s>

<s>the trade bodies which came in the wake of the A.L.A.M.</s>

<s>were more representative , for they never adopted a policy of exclusion .</s>

<s>nevertheless , it is from the Selden organization that the industry inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests of the trade .</s>

<s>one of the chief features of this community of interest is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement , a milestone in the development of American industrial cooperation .</s>

<s>its origin lies in the Selden patent controversy and its aftermath .</s>

<s>from the earliest days of the motor car industry , before the A.L.A.M.</s>

<s>was established , patent infringement loomed as a serious and vexing problem .</s>

<s>many patent contests were waged over automobile components and accessories , among them tires , detachable rims , ball bearings , license brackets , and electric horns .</s>

<s>the fluidity and momentum of the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims .</s>

<s>as early as 1900 a Wall Street combination acquired detail patents with the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers .</s>

<s>this scheme failed , and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest in 1912 .</s>

<s>in this tangle of conflicting claims , the patent-sharing scheme adopted by the A.L.A.M.</s>

<s>at its founding proved to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant litigation .</s>

<s>the interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty eliminated infringement suits among the members of the A.L.A.M.</s>

<s>patent pool ( although it did not protect them against outside actions ) and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive technology .</s>

<s>one of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of patent rights among A.L.A.M.</s>

<s>members .</s>

<s>within its limits , this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics of a cross-licensing agreement .</s>

<s>its positive features outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly .</s>

<s>since the A.L.A.M.</s>

<s>holdings embraced only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents , the denial of rights to independent companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of the industry .</s>

<s>the highly important Dyer patents on the sliding gear transmission were held by the A.L.A.M.</s>

<s>pool .</s>

<s>but Henry Ford used the planetary transmission in his Model J and earlier cars and , in 1905 , as a precautionary measure , took out a license from the man who claimed to be its inventor .</s>

<s>for those affiliated with it , the A.L.A.M.</s>

<s>pool was a haven from the infringement actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting intensity after 1900 .</s>

<s>by 1910 the courts were crowded with cases , many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions .</s>

<s>it was commonplace for auto makers , parts-suppliers , and dealers to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their daily mail .</s>

<s>purely from the business man's standpoint and without regard to the lawyer's view , commented a trade journal , the matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents are to become weapons of warfare in business , instead of simple beneficient protection devices for encouraging inventive creation .</s>

<s>occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain prospect of legal complications .</s>

<s>one manufacturer who held an allegedly basic patent said : I would readily put over $50,000 into the manufacture of the device , but it is so easy to make that we would enter immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would eat up all our profits .</s>

<s>the prevailing view in the industry was summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a Senate committee : the exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions , including delays surrounding legal disputes , particularly in patent litigation , are items of industrial burden which must be written large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste .</s>

<s>by that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical information .</s>

<s>at this point Charles C. Hanch , long an advocate of patent peace in the industry , became chairman of the patents committee of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce , successor to the Automobile Board of Trade .</s>

<s>Hanch was treasurer of the Nordyke & Marmon Company , an Indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling machinery before producing the Marmon car in 1904 .</s>

<s>he had first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890's .</s>

<s>anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry , Hanch went to Detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading A.L.A.M.</s>

<s>members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan .</s>

<s>the breach created by the Selden patent doomed his proposal , but Hanch did not abandon his scheme .</s>

<s>after the demise of the A.L.A.M.</s>

<s>, the time was propitious for establishing such a pool .</s>

<s>it is a much easier course to agree to let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned , said a trade authority , than to continue the costly effort of straightening the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system , which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day .</s>

<s>with the other members of the patents committee -- Wilfred C. Leland , Howard E. Coffin , Windsor T. White , and W. H. Vandervoort -- Hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution .</s>

<s>a little farther along the road you come to the Church of Santa Sabina , called the Pearl of the Aventine .</s>

<s>continue another hundred yards to the Piazza of the Knights of Malta .</s>

<s>on the wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments .</s>

<s>if you look through the keyhole , you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome of St. Peter's framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees .</s>

<s>oleanders , cypress , and palms in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section .</s>

<s>turn left a block or so before the street ends , and then turn right down the Via Di Santa Prisca to the Viale Aventino .</s>

<s>here you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city .</s>

<s>the renaissance city to the piazza Navona and pantheon
these two walks take you through the heart of Rome .</s>

<s>you will walk some of the narrow , old streets , hemmed in by massive palazzi .</s>

<s>you will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed , a magnificent square , the main shopping district , the Spanish Steps , and the lovely Pincian Gardens .</s>

<s>by seeing such varied places , both interesting and beautiful , you will become aware of the many different civilizations Rome has lived through , and in particular , get a feel of Renaissance Rome .</s>

<s>you will realize why Rome is indeed the Eternal City .</s>

<s>start on the Via D. Teatro Di Marcello at the foot of the Capitoline Hill .</s>

<s>the majestic circular tiers of stone of the Theatre of Marcellus give you some idea of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus erected in 13 B.C.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in Roman days .</s>

<s>Andrea Palladio , an Italian architect of the sixteenth century , modeled his designs on its Doric and Ionic columns .</s>

<s>wander past the three superb Columns of Apollo by the arches of the theatre .</s>

<s>the remains of the Portico of Octavia are now in front of you .</s>

<s>climb the steps from the theatre to the Via Della Tribuna Di Campitelli for an even better view of the Columns of Apollo .</s>

<s>turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny Piazza Campitelli , then proceed along the Via Dei Funari to the Piazza Mattei .</s>

<s>here is one of the loveliest fountains in Rome , the Fontana delle Tartarughe or Fountain of the Tortoises .</s>

<s>it's typical of Rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find such an artistic work in the center of a little square .</s>

<s>stand here for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths , each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head of a dolphin .</s>

<s>the figures have been executed so skillfully that one senses a great feeling of life and movement .</s>

<s>opposite is the Palazzo Mattei , one of Rome's oldest palaces , now the headquarters of the Italo-American Association .</s>

<s>go inside for a closer look at a Renaissance palace .</s>

<s>in the first courtyard there are some fine bas-reliefs and friezes , and in the second a series of delightful terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall .</s>

<s>the Palazzo Caetani , still inhabited by the Caetani family , adjoins the Palazzo Mattei .</s>

<s>keep straight ahead on the Via Falegnami , cross the wide Via Arenula , and you will come to the Piazza B. Cairoli , where you should look in at the Church of San Carlo Ai Catinari to see the frescoes on the ceiling .</s>

<s>follow the colorful and busy Via D. Giubbonari for a hundred yards or so .</s>

<s>now turn left at the Via dell' Arco Del Monte to the Piazza Dei Pellegrini .</s>

<s>just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo Di Ferro will bring you to the Palazzo Spada , built in 1540 and now occupied by the Council of State .</s>

<s>paintings by Titian , Caravaggio , and Rubens are on display ( open 9:30 to 4:00 ) .</s>

<s>before you enter the palazzo , note Francesco Borromini's facade .</s>

<s>the great architect also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which connects the two courts .</s>

<s>the large statue on the first floor is believed to be the statue of Pompey at the base of which Julius Caesar was stabbed to death ( if so , the statue once stood in the senate house ) .</s>

<s>( this is shown in the afternoon and on Sunday morning .
)</s>

<s>by tipping the porter , you can see in the courtyard Borromini's unusual and fascinating trick in perspective .</s>

<s>when you stand before the barrel-vaulted colonnade you have the impression that the statue at the end is at a considerable distance , yet it is actually only a few feet away .</s>

<s>the sense of perspective has been created by designing the length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade are much shorter than those in front .</s>

<s>the gardens of the palazzo , shaded by a huge magnolia tree , are most attractive .</s>

<s>the courtyard is magnificently decorated .</s>

<s>from the Palazzo Spada you continue another block along the Via Capo Di Ferro and Vicolo De Venti to the imposing Palazzo Farnese , begun in 1514 and considered by many to be the finest palace of all .</s>

<s>Michelangelo was the most distinguished of several noted architects who helped design it .</s>

<s>today it is occupied by the French Embassy .</s>

<s>its lovely seventeenth-century ceiling frescoes , as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling , can be seen Sundays ( 11:00 to 12:00 noon ) .</s>

<s>ask to see the modern tapestries of Paris and Rome designed by Lurcat .</s>

<s>directly in front of the palace along the Via D. Baullari you will come to the Campo Di Fiori , the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of Renaissance Rome .</s>

<s>today , by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit , vegetable , and flower market .</s>

<s>continue on the Via D. Baullari to the Corso Vittorio Emanuele , then turn right for a couple of hundred yards to the Church of Sant' Andrea Della Valle .</s>

<s>as you approach the church on the Via D. Baullari you are passing within yards of the remains of the Roman Theatre of Pompey , near which is believed to have been the place where Julius Caesar was assassinated .</s>

<s>the dome of the church is , outside of St. Peter's , one of the largest in Rome .</s>

<s>opera lovers will be interested to learn that this church was the scene for the first act of Tosca .</s>

<s>at this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio Emanuele 2 , walk along the Corso Del Rinascimento a couple of hundred yards , then turn left on the Via Dei Canestrani to enter the splendid Piazza Navona , one of the truly glorious sights in Rome .</s>

<s>your first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains , its two churches that almost face each other , and its russet-colored buildings , is a sense of restful spaciousness -- particularly welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have followed since starting this walk .</s>

<s>the site of the oblong piazza is Domitian's ancient stadium , which was probably used for horse and chariot races .</s>

<s>for centuries it was the location of historic festivals and open-air sports events .</s>

<s>from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in the summer , and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated square in their carriages .</s>

<s>Giovanni Bernini's Fountain of the Rivers , in the center of the piazza , is built around a Roman obelisk from the Circus of Maxentius which rests on grottoes and rocks , with four huge figures , one at each corner , denoting four great rivers from different continents -- the Danube , the Ganges , the Nile , and the Plate .</s>

<s>the eyes of the figure of the Nile are covered , perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure from her sight the baroque facade of the Church of Sant' Agnese in Agone , the work of Bernini's rival , Borromini .</s>

<s>in the Piazza Navona there are many delightful cafes where you can sit , have a drink or lunch , and watch the fountains in the square .</s>

<s>the scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about Rome .</s>

<s>perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch .</s>

<s>take the Via Di S. Agnese in Agone , next to the church and opposite the center of the square , then turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the beautiful Church of Santa Maria Della Pace .</s>

<s>inside you will find the lovely Sibyls painted by Raphael and a chapel designed by Michelangelo .</s>

<s>the church's cloisters are among Donato Bramante's most beautiful creations .</s>

<s>now return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on the opposite side by the Corsia Agonale ;
in a moment cross the Corso Del Rinascimento .</s>

<s>in front of you is the Palazzo Madama , once belonging to the Medici and now the Italian Senate .</s>

<s>walk by the side of the palazzo and after two blocks along the Via Giustiniani you will come to the Piazza Della Rotonda .</s>

<s>you are now facing the Pantheon , the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the days of ancient Rome .</s>

<s>this circular edifice , constructed by Agrippa in B.C.</s>

<s>27 , was rebuilt in its present shape by the Emperor Hadrian .</s>

<s>it was dedicated as a church in the seventh century .</s>

<s>as you pause in the piazza by the Egyptian obelisk brought from the Temple of Isis , you will admire the Pantheon's impressive Corinthian columns .</s>

<s>the Pantheon's interior , still in its original form , is truly majestic and an architectural triumph .</s>

<s>its rotunda forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from the floor to the ceiling .</s>

<s>the only means of interior light is the twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous dome .</s>

<s>standing before the tomb of Raphael , the great genius of the Renaissance , when shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great Roman temple , you are once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of Rome .</s>

<s>as you leave the Pantheon , take the narrow street to the right , the Via Del Seminario , a block to Sant' Ignazio , one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city .</s>

<s>( along the way there , about one hundred yards on your right , you pass a simple restaurant , La Sacrestia , where you can have the best pizza in Rome .
)</s>

<s>the curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church seems like a stage set .</s>

<s>this is one of the most charming little squares in this part of Rome .</s>

<s>one block along the Via De Burro ( in front of the church ) will bring you to the Stock Exchange in the old Temple of Neptune .</s>

<s>a few yards farther , on the Via Dei Bergamaschi , is the Piazza Colonna .</s>

<s>the great column from which the square takes its name was erected by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius .</s>

<s>you are now at the Corso , though narrow , one of Rome's busiest streets .</s>

<s>horse races took place here in the Middle Ages .</s>

<s>if you have taken this stroll in the morning , and you have the time and inclination , walk to the right along the crowded Corso for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings -- mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries -- in the Palazzo Doria ( open Sunday , Tuesday , and Thursday , 10:00 to 1:00 ) .</s>

<s>here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where the family still lives .</s>

<s>otherwise , cross over the Corso and walk a block or so to the left .</s>

<s>you will come to Alemagna , a delightful , though moderately expensive restaurant , which is particularly noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries .</s>

<s>either here , or in one of the modest restaurants nearby , is just the place to end this first walk through the heart of Rome .</s>

<s>to the Spanish steps
the second walk through the heart of Rome should be taken after lunch , so that you will reach the Pincian Hill when the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best .</s>

<s>rare , indeed , is the Harlem citizen , from the most circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent , who does not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence , injustice , or brutality .</s>

<s>I myself have witnessed and endured it more than once .</s>

<s>the businessmen and racketeers also have a story .</s>

<s>and so do the prostitutes .</s>

<s>( and this is not , perhaps , the place to discuss Harlem's very complex attitude toward black policemen , nor the reasons , according to Harlem , that they are nearly all downtown .
)</s>

<s>it is hard , on the other hand , to blame the policeman , blank , good-natured , thoughtless , and insuperably innocent , for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves .</s>

<s>he , too , believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended when they are not taken for the deed .</s>

<s>he has never , himself , done anything for which to be hated -- which of us has ?</s>

<s>-- and yet he is facing , daily and nightly , people who would gladly see him dead , and he knows it .</s>

<s>there is no way for him not to know it : there are few things under heaven more unnerving than the silent , accumulating contempt and hatred of a people .</s>

<s>he moves through Harlem , therefore , like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country ;
which is precisely what , and where , he is , and is the reason he walks in twos and threes .</s>

<s>and he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company : the people who are watching him know why , too .</s>

<s>any street meeting , sacred or secular , which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white domination .</s>

<s>and these days , of course , in terms increasingly vivid and jubilant , it speaks of the end of that domination .</s>

<s>the white policeman standing on a Harlem street corner finds himself at the very center of the revolution now occurring in the world .</s>

<s>he is not prepared for it -- naturally , nobody is -- and , what is possibly much more to the point , he is exposed , as few white people are , to the anguish of the black people around him .</s>

<s>even if he is gifted with the merest mustard grain of imagination , something must seep in .</s>

<s>he cannot avoid observing that some of the children , in spite of their color , remind him of children he has known and loved , perhaps even of his own children .</s>

<s>he knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way .</s>

<s>he can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction : into a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature .</s>

<s>he becomes more callous , the population becomes more hostile , the situation grows more tense , and the police force is increased .</s>

<s>one day , to everyone's astonishment , someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything blows up .</s>

<s>before the dust has settled or the blood congealed , editorials , speeches , and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land , demanding to know what happened .</s>

<s>what happened is that Negroes want to be treated like men .</s>

<s>Negroes want to be treated like men : a perfectly straightforward statement , containing only seven words .</s>

<s>people who have mastered Kant , Hegel , Shakespeare , Marx , Freud , and the Bible find this statement utterly impenetrable .</s>

<s>the idea seems to threaten profound , barely conscious assumptions .</s>

<s>a kind of panic paralyzes their features , as though they found themselves trapped on the edge of a steep place .</s>

<s>I once tried to describe to a very well-known American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South .</s>

<s>my recital disturbed him and made him indignant ;
and he asked me in perfect innocence , why don't all the Negroes in the South move North ?</s>

<s>I tried to explain what has happened , unfailingly , whenever a significant body of Negroes move North .</s>

<s>they do not escape Jim Crow : they merely encounter another , not-less-deadly variety .</s>

<s>they do not move to Chicago , they move to the South Side ;
they do not move to New York , they move to Harlem .</s>

<s>the pressure within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand , and this expansion is always violent .</s>

<s>white people hold the line as long as they can , and in as many ways as they can , from verbal intimidation to physical violence .</s>

<s>but inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto .</s>

<s>the white people fall back bitterly before the black horde ;
the landlords make a tidy profit by raising the rent , chopping up the rooms , and all but dispensing with the upkeep ;
and what has once been a neighborhood turns into a turf .</s>

<s>this is precisely what happened when the Puerto Ricans arrived in their thousands -- and the bitterness thus caused is , as I write , being fought out all up and down those streets .</s>

<s>northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury .</s>

<s>they seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the Civil War , and won , they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going on in the South , without taking any responsibility for it ;
and that they can ignore what is happening in Northern cities because what is happening in Little Rock or Birmingham is worse .</s>

<s>well , in the first place , it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both to know which is worse .</s>

<s>I know Negroes who prefer the South and white Southerners , because at least there , you haven't got to play any guessing games ]
the guessing games referred to have driven more than one Negro into the narcotics ward , the madhouse , or the river .</s>

<s>I know another Negro , a man very dear to me , who says , with conviction and with truth , the spirit of the South is the spirit of America .</s>

<s>he was born in the North and did his military training in the South .</s>

<s>he did not , as far as I can gather , find the South worse ;
he found it , if anything , all too familiar .</s>

<s>in the second place , though , even if Birmingham is worse , no doubt Johannesburg , South Africa , beats it by several miles , and Buchenwald was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history of the world .</s>

<s>the world has never lacked for horrifying examples ;
but I do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification for our own crimes .</s>

<s>this perpetual justification empties the heart of all human feeling .</s>

<s>the emptier our hearts become , the greater will be our crimes .</s>

<s>thirdly , the South is not merely an embarrassingly backward region , but a part of this country , and what happens there concerns every one of us .</s>

<s>as far as the color problem is concerned , there is but one great difference between the Southern white and the Northerner : the Southerner remembers , historically and in his own psyche , a kind of Eden in which he loved black people and they loved him .</s>

<s>historically , the flaming sword laid across this Eden is the Civil War .</s>

<s>personally , it is the Southerner's sexual coming of age , when , without any warning , unbreakable taboos are set up between himself and his past .</s>

<s>everything , thereafter , is permitted him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need .</s>

<s>the resulting , indescribable torment affects every Southern mind and is the basis of the Southern hysteria .</s>

<s>none of this is true for the Northerner .</s>

<s>Negroes represent nothing to him personally , except , perhaps , the dangers of carnality .</s>

<s>he never sees Negroes .</s>

<s>Southerners see them all the time .</s>

<s>Northerners never think about them whereas Southerners are never really thinking of anything else .</s>

<s>Negroes are , therefore , ignored in the North and are under surveillance in the South , and suffer hideously in both places .</s>

<s>neither the Southerner nor the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply as a man .</s>

<s>it seems to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the Negro be considered either as a kind of ward ( in which case we are told how many Negroes , comparatively , bought Cadillacs last year and how few , comparatively , were lynched ) , or as a victim ( in which case we are promised that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our kids ) .</s>

<s>they are two sides of the same coin and the South will not change -- cannot change -- until the North changes .</s>

<s>the country will not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really means by freedom .</s>

<s>in the meantime , generations keep being born , bitterness is increased by incompetence , pride , and folly , and the world shrinks around us .</s>

<s>it is a terrible , an inexorable , law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own : in the face of one's victim , one sees oneself .</s>

<s>walk through the streets of Harlem and see what we , this nation , have become .</s>

<s>4 .</s>

<s>East River , downtown : postscript to a letter from Harlem
the fact that American Negroes rioted in the U.N. while Adlai Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked and baffled most white Americans .</s>

<s>Stevenson's speech , and the spectacular disturbance in the gallery , were both touched off by the death , in Katanga , the day before , of Patrice Lumumba .</s>

<s>Stevenson stated , in the course of his address , that the United States was against colonialism .</s>

<s>God knows what the African nations , who hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the U.N. were thinking -- they may , for example , have been thinking of the U.S. abstention when the vote on Algerian freedom was before the Assembly -- but I think I have a fairly accurate notion of what the Negroes in the gallery were thinking .</s>

<s>I had intended to be there myself .</s>

<s>it was my first reaction upon hearing of Lumumba's death .</s>

<s>I was curious about the impact of this political assassination on Negroes in Harlem , for Lumumba had -- has -- captured the popular imagination there .</s>

<s>I was curious to know if Lumumba's death , which is surely among the most sinister of recent events , would elicit from our side anything more than the usual , well-meaning rhetoric .</s>

<s>and I was curious about the African reaction .</s>

<s>however , the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the U.N. gallery .</s>

<s>had I been there , I , too , in the eyes of most Americans , would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the Communists .</s>

<s>the climate and the events of the last decade , and the steady pressure of the cold war , have given Americans yet another means of avoiding self-examination , and so it has been decided that the riots were Communist inspired .</s>

<s>nor was it long , naturally , before prominent Negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the U.N. rioters do not represent the real feeling of the Negro community .</s>

<s>according , then , to what I take to be the prevailing view , these rioters were merely a handful of irresponsible , Stalinist-corrupted provocateurs .</s>

<s>I find this view amazing .</s>

<s>it is a view which even a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict .</s>

<s>one has only , for example , to walk through Harlem and ask oneself two questions .</s>

<s>the first question is : would I like to live here ?</s>

<s>and the second question is : why don't those who now live here move out ?</s>

<s>the answer to both questions is immediately obvious .</s>

<s>unless one takes refuge in the theory -- however disguised -- that Negroes are , somehow , different from white people , I do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the Negro's status in this country is not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability .</s>

<s>now , I do not doubt that , among the people at the U.N. that day , there were Stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives .</s>

<s>wherever there is great social discontent , these people are , sooner or later , to be found .</s>

<s>their presence is not as frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity .</s>

<s>what I find appalling -- and really dangerous -- is the American assumption that the Negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest .</s>

<s>it is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult , implying , as it does , that Negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated .</s>

<s>color was delayed until 1935 , the wide screen until the early fifties .</s>

<s>movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties .</s>

<s>each film consisted of fifty feet , which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen .</s>

<s>as long as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to adventure further .</s>

<s>motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as Times Square .</s>

<s>brief snips of actual events were shown : parades , dances , street scenes .</s>

<s>the sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity : a train rushes straight at the audience , or a great wave threatens to break over the seats .</s>

<s>an early Edison production was The Execution Of Mary , Queen Of Scots .</s>

<s>the unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold ;
the headsman swung his axe ;
the head dropped off ;
end of film .</s>

<s>an early film by a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage .</s>

<s>in the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom , and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded , one-minute shows .</s>

<s>in response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day .</s>

<s>despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries , art films , and travelogues , despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama , the movies are at heart a form of fiction , like the play , the novel , or the short story .</s>

<s>moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature .</s>

<s>thus such great American documentaries as The River and The Plow That Broke The Plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures .</s>

<s>the discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a French magician , Georges Melies , and an American employee of Edison , Edwin S. Porter .</s>

<s>of the two , Porter is justly the better known , for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film , toward making the motion picture the intricate , efficient time machine that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands .</s>

<s>narrative time and film time
Melies , however , out of his professional instincts as a magician , discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film .</s>

<s>one of these is the dissolve , which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene .</s>

<s>as the first scene begins to fade , the succeeding scene begins to appear .</s>

<s>for a moment or two , both scenes are present simultaneously , one growing weaker , one growing stronger .</s>

<s>in a series of fairy tales and fantasies , Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story , with beginning , middle and end , complications , resolutions , climaxes , and conclusions .</s>

<s>immediately , the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time .</s>

<s>physically , a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at a time at such a speed that the eye remembers the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing .</s>

<s>linking the smoothly changing images together , the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement .</s>

<s>the projection time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective , varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions .</s>

<s>so is the time of the novel .</s>

<s>the drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time , but the time is fixed by the director and the players , the conductor and the instrumentalists , subject , therefore , to much variation , as record collectors well know .</s>

<s>the time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely .</s>

<s>the film consists of a series of still , transparent photographs , or frames , 35-mm.-wide .</s>

<s>each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen , at the rate , for silent movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second .</s>

<s>this is the rate of projection ;
it is also the rate of photographing .</s>

<s>time is built into the motion picture , which cannot exist without time .</s>

<s>now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end -- elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence .</s>

<s>the moving picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to be sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree ;
the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo .</s>

<s>in narrative , time is essential , as it is in film .</s>

<s>almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time .</s>

<s>this discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician's tricks produced on film .</s>

<s>it was Porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued .</s>

<s>the movie was The Great Train Robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all but incalculable .</s>

<s>overnight , for one thing , Porter's film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten .</s>

<s>The Great Train Robbery is a one-reel film .</s>

<s>one reel -- from eight to twelve minutes -- became the standard length from the year of Robbery , 1903 , until Griffith shattered that limit forever with Birth Of A Nation in 1915 .</s>

<s>the reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies .</s>

<s>the material of the Porter film is simplicity itself ;
much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it -- good guys and bad guys in the old West -- pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's .</s>

<s>a band of robbers enters a railroad station , overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator , holds up the train and escapes .</s>

<s>a posse is formed and pursues the robbers , who , having made their escape , are whooping it up with some wild , wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out .</s>

<s>the robbers run from the hide-out , take cover in a wooded declivity , and are shot dead by the posse .</s>

<s>as a finale is appended a close-up of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience .</s>

<s>all this is simple enough , but in telling the story Porter did two important things that had not been done before .</s>

<s>each scene is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom , from a camera fixed in a single position , but in the outdoor scenes , especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws , Porter's camera position breaks , necessarily , with the camera position standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play .</s>

<s>the plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen .</s>

<s>if the change , at first sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the Italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change , and the Italian painters , by universal consent , were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen .</s>

<s>in that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device .</s>

<s>he did more than that .</s>

<s>he revealed the potential value of the cut as the basic technique in the art of the film .</s>

<s>cutting , of course , takes place automatically in the creation of a film .</s>

<s>the meaning of the word is quite physical , to begin with .</s>

<s>the physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is joined physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence .</s>

<s>if , as a home movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps , you have merely recorded an historical event .</s>

<s>if , in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends , you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's grandmother watching this event , you have begun to be an artist in film ;
you are employing the basic technique of film ;
you are cutting .</s>

<s>this is what Porter did .</s>

<s>as the robbers leave the looted train , the film suddenly cuts back to the station , where the telegrapher's little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only to find him bound on the floor .</s>

<s>she dashes around in alarm .</s>

<s>the two events are taking place at the same time .</s>

<s>time and space have both become cinematic .</s>

<s>we leap from event to event -- including the formation of the posse -- even though the events , in reality are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance .</s>

<s>the chase as a standard film device probably dates from The Great Train Robbery , and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device .</s>

<s>the chase in itself is a narrative ;
it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting -- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both .</s>

<s>the simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction .</s>

<s>the cowboy films , the cops and robbers films , and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ;
these films and these sequences are also seeking out -- instinctively or by design -- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative .</s>

<s>the creator of the art of the film : D.W. Griffith
there still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art .</s>

<s>the man was D.W. Griffith .</s>

<s>when he came to the movies -- more or less by accident -- they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes .</s>

<s>in about seven years Griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film maker .</s>

<s>before he was forty Griffith had created the art of the film .</s>

<s>not that there had not been attempts , mostly European , to do exactly that .</s>

<s>but in general the European efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself .</s>

<s>staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented .</s>

<s>great actors and actresses -- the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt -- were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera .</s>

<s>in all of this extensive and expensive effort , the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author .</s>

<s>the phonograph today , for all its high fidelity and stereophonic sound , is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera .</s>

<s>not surprisingly , this approach did not work .</s>

<s>the effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names .</s>

<s>but no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies .</s>

<s>in general , religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis ;
congregational membership , however , is another thing .</s>

<s>a congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership ;
that is , when it can preserve economic integration .</s>

<s>religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force , but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining ;
the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition .</s>

<s>the breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city churches .</s>

<s>central cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations : ( 1 ) central cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes ;
( 2 ) central cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition .</s>

<s>the central city areas , in other words , exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations : they have too few middle-class people ;
they mix middle-class people with lower-class residents .</s>

<s>central city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central cities .</s>

<s>with few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city .</s>

<s>the key to Protestant development , therefore , is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation .</s>

<s>members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus , so that Protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes ;
but this is deceptive , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum .</s>

<s>the congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood ;
moreover , residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum in order to survive ;
they can lose higher- and lower-status members from the church without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration .</s>

<s>the congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group ;
it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship .</s>

<s>if it were primarily a believing fellowship , it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks , something which most congregations of the New Protestantism ( with a few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do .</s>

<s>they survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers .</s>

<s>the vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the folksy spirit of Protestant religious life ;
in fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the impersonal Roman Catholic parish .</s>

<s>we have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ;
consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations ;
actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection .</s>

<s>the vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration .</s>

<s>this fact is evident in the recruitment of new members .</s>

<s>mission as co-optation
the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations .</s>

<s>there is much talk in theological circles about the Church as Mission and the Church's Mission ;
theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world .</s>

<s>a crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism .</s>

<s>if economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration .</s>

<s>the task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation .</s>

<s>( co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy ;
it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization .
)</s>

<s>in a mobile society , congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment ;
this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ;
therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation -- like elements will have to be assimilated .</s>

<s>evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ;
one study in Pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation .</s>

<s>in a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial contacts with friendly members .</s>

<s>if we add to these contacts with friendly members the contacts with an organization of the church ( 11.2 per cent of the cases ) , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact .</s>

<s>on the surface , this seems a sound approach to Christian mission : members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people ;
the new people respond in kind by joining the church .</s>

<s>missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods ;
the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ;
association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations .</s>

<s>this means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ;
the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation ;
the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation .</s>

<s>churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ;
once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless -- friendly contacts no longer keep it going .</s>

<s>the transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities , worship , preaching , and publicity in reaching new members .</s>

<s>the proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17.3 per cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ) .</s>

<s>publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with new members .</s>

<s>in general , friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches , making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church ;
economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood .</s>

<s>the inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ;
the outer life of congregations -- the suitability of the environment to their survival -- will be propitious so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership .</s>

<s>economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation .</s>

<s>in a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation .</s>

<s>the fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance .</s>

<s>the expense of this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile society ;
nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development .</s>

<s>it was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends -- expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings .</s>

<s>these trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis .</s>

<s>residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions .</s>

<s>the motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized ;
the schism between central city and suburb , Negro and White , blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis .</s>

<s>it now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings .</s>

<s>the accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations .</s>

<s>this conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment .</s>

<s>more than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples .</s>

<s>since American life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis .</s>

<s>consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests .</s>

<s>Negroes , Puerto Ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities .</s>

<s>soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century .</s>

<s>the identification of the basic unit of religious organization -- the parish or congregation -- with a residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation .</s>

<s>mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion .</s>

<s>this interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches .</s>

<s>it could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes .</s>

<s>it could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local stabilities .</s>

<s>whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people .</s>

<s>attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches ;
this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes .</s>

<s>the keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem .</s>

<s>these values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , dictating the methods of child rearing , determining the pattern of community participation , setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness , and informing the congregational life of the major denominations .</s>

<s>fellowship by likeness and mission by friendly contact form the iron cage of denominational religion .</s>

<s>its contents are another matter , for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation .</s>

<s>what goes on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church .</s>

<s>an understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity .</s>

<s>the perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need .</s>

<s>with capital largely squandered , there seemed to them no other course to pursue .</s>

<s>the directors sold directly to concessionaires , who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company .</s>

<s>these concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the Indians through engages , who might be habitants , voyageurs , or even soldiers .</s>

<s>the concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded , and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to France in company ships .</s>

<s>the company disposed of the pelts , but with what profit , the records do not show .</s>

<s>in accord with its penurious policy , the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians .</s>

<s>the lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the Indian trade of New France and Louisiana in the previous century , and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men .</s>

<s>traders from the English colonies were far more generous , and Indian loyalty turned to them .</s>

<s>protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded , and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company .</s>

<s>in 1721 the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony .</s>

<s>they ordered the raising of troops and obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts .</s>

<s>they adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into five districts .</s>

<s>in each of these there was to be a strong military post , and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses .</s>

<s>for southeastern Louisiana , Mobile was the principal post , and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east , in the region threatened by British traders .</s>

<s>Mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the Tennessee River .</s>

<s>Fort Toulouse , on the Alabama River , had been erected in 1714 for trade with the Alabamas and Choctaws , but money was available for only one other new post , near the present Nashville , Tennessee , and this was soon abandoned .</s>

<s>west of the Mobile district was the lower Mississippi district , of which New Orleans was headquarters .</s>

<s>dependent upon it were posts on the lower Mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers of New Spain .</s>

<s>on the middle Mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the Arkansas .</s>

<s>it was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west , principally down the Arkansas River .</s>

<s>on the Ohio or Wabash was to be built another post at the fork of two great rivers .</s>

<s>other posts would be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication with Canada .</s>

<s>on the upper Mississippi the Illinois post was to be established near Kaskaskia , and dependent posts were to be built on the Missouri , where there are mines in abundance .</s>

<s>each of the five principal posts was to have a director , responsible to a director-general at New Orleans .</s>

<s>an elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out , and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way .</s>

<s>concessionaires were to be under the supervision of the directors .</s>

<s>engages must be loyal to the concessionaires , and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended .</s>

<s>the habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires .</s>

<s>only two principal storehouses were actually established -- one at Mobile , the other at New Orleans .</s>

<s>New Orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi , and west of that river , and on the Ohio and Wabash .</s>

<s>Mobile was also supplied by New Orleans with goods for the Mobile district .</s>

<s>the power that Bienville exercised during his first administration cannot be determined .</s>

<s>regulations for the Indian trade were made by the Conseil superieure de la Louisiane , and Bienville apparently did not have control of that body .</s>

<s>the Conseil even treated the serious matter of British aggression as its business and , on its own authority , sent to disaffected savages merchandise suitable for the peltry trade .</s>

<s>it decided , also , that the purely secular efforts of Bienville were insufficient , and sent missionaries to win the savages from the heathen Carolinians .</s>

<s>during the first administration of Bienville , the peltry trade of the Mobile district was a lucrative source of revenue .</s>

<s>the Alabamas brought in annually 15,000 to 20,000 deerskins , and the Choctaws and Chickasaws brought the total up to 50,000 pelts .</s>

<s>these deerskins were the raw material for the manufacture of leather , and were the only articles which the tribes of this district had to exchange for European goods .</s>

<s>during his first administration , Bienville succeeded in keeping Carolina traders out of the Alabama country and the Choctaw country .</s>

<s>the director of the post at Mobile kept an adequate amount of French goods , of a kind to which they were accustomed , to supply the Indian needs .</s>

<s>the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and cheaply .</s>

<s>De La Laude , commander of the Alabama post , had the friendship of the natives , and was able to make them look upon the British as poor competitors .</s>

<s>Diron D'Artaguette , the most prominent trader in the district , was energetic and resourceful , but his methods often aroused the ire of the French governors .</s>

<s>he became , after a time , commander of a post on the Alabama River , but his operations extended from Mobile throughout the district , and he finally obtained a monopoly of the Indian trade .</s>

<s>the Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the Mobile district .</s>

<s>their territory lay to the north , near the sources of the Alabama , the Tombigbee , the Tennessee , and Cumberland rivers , and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees .</s>

<s>in 1720 some Chickasaws massacred the French traders among them , and did not make peace for four years .</s>

<s>venturesome traders , however , continued to come to them from Mobile , and to obtain a considerable number of pelts for the French markets .</s>

<s>British traders from South Carolina incited the Indians against the French , and there developed French and British Factions in the tribe .</s>

<s>the Chickasaws finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the French control of Louisiana .</s>

<s>to hold them was an essential part of French policy , for they controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to Mobile .</s>

<s>they threatened constantly to give the British a hold on this region , from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the French settlements near the Gulf .</s>

<s>Bienville realized that if the French were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of British goods , French traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant as the Carolinians and at reasonable prices .</s>

<s>his urgings brought some results .</s>

<s>the Company of the Indies promised to send over a supply of Indian trading goods , and to price them more cheaply in terms of deerskins .</s>

<s>but it coupled with this a requirement that Indians must bring their pelts to Mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the Indian country .</s>

<s>the insistence of Bienville upon giving liberal prices to the Indians , in order to drive back the Carolina traders , was probably a factor that led to his recall in 1724 .</s>

<s>for two years his friend and cousin , Boisbriant , remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the Anglican advance .</s>

<s>although he incited a few friendly Indians to pillage the invaders , and even kill some of them , the Carolina advance continued .</s>

<s>the company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from Carolina , and when Perier came over as governor in 1727 , he was given special instructions regarding the trade of the Mobile district .</s>

<s>but the Company of the Indies , holding to its program of economy , made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices .</s>

<s>to the directors the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy .</s>

<s>Perier attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among the Indians .</s>

<s>these agents were to ascertain the difference between English and French goods , and the prices charged the Indians .</s>

<s>they were to conciliate the unfriendly savages , and , wherever possible , to incite the natives to pillage the traders from Carolina .</s>

<s>they were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men , as well as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering .</s>

<s>Perier's intrigues gained some successes .</s>

<s>the savages divided into two factions ;
one was British and the other , French .</s>

<s>so hostile did these factions become that , among the Choctaws , civil war broke out .</s>

<s>Perier's efforts , however , were on the whole ineffective in winning back the tribes of the Mobile district , and he decided to send troops into the troubled country .</s>

<s>he asked the government for two hundred soldiers , who were to be specifically assigned to arrest English traders and disloyal Indians .</s>

<s>in spite of the company's restrictions , he planned to build new posts in the territory .</s>

<s>he asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the Indians' pelts .</s>

<s>no help came from the crown , and Perier , in desperation , gave a monopoly of the Indian trade in the district to D'Artaguette .</s>

<s>D'Artaguette went vigorously to work , and gave credit to many hunters .</s>

<s>but they brought back few pelts to pay their debts , and soon French trade in the region was at an end .</s>

<s>Perier finally , in one last bid in 1730 , cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in France .</s>

<s>the Indians were not impressed and held to the Carolina traders , who swarmed over the country , almost to the Mississippi .</s>

<s>with the loss of the Mobile trade , which ended all profits from Louisiana , the Natchez Indians revolted .</s>

<s>they destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods , and harassed French shipping on the Mississippi .</s>

<s>the war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts .</s>

<s>in January , 1731 , the company asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony .</s>

<s>it stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations , and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade .</s>

<s>it offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade , but asked an indemnity .</s>

<s>the King accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the company at 1,450,000 livres .</s>

<s>thenceforth , the commerce of Louisiana was free to all Frenchmen .</s>

<s>company rule in Louisiana left the colony without fortifications , arms , munitions , or supplies .</s>

<s>the difficulties of trade had ruined many voyageurs , and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families .</s>

<s>others left the country , and there was no one familiar with the Indian trade .</s>

<s>if this trade should be resumed , the habitants who had come to be farmers or artisans , and soldiers discharged from the army , must be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois .</s>

<s>this was a slow and difficult course , and French trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group of traders .</s>

<s>these men were without capital or experience .</s>

<s>Perier and Salmon , the intendant , wished either to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts with pelts .</s>

<s>Bienville , who returned to succeed Perier in 1732 , objected that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing a trade in which they could see no hope of profits .</s>

<s>he reported , too , that among the habitants there were none of probity and ability sufficient to justify entrusting them with the King's goods .</s>

<s>he did find some to trust , however , and he employed the King's soldiers to trade .</s>

<s>with no company to interfere , he kept close control over all the traders .</s>

<s>in order to compete with English traders , Bienville radically changed the price schedule .</s>

<s>the King should expect no profit , and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in France , which would cover the expense of transportation and handling , was all he charged the traders .</s>

<s>they would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury's expense .</s>

<s>they would be particularly displeased with the State Department if it were the source of such reports .</s>

<s>few things are more perilous for the State Department than a displeased congressman .</s>

<s>the reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are so available .</s>

<s>first , the State Department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters .</s>

<s>the farmers may be aroused if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department's budget .</s>

<s>businessmen will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department .</s>

<s>labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department ;
the Chamber of Commerce , assaults upon the Treasury .</s>

<s>a kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare .</s>

<s>the congressman's patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense Department .</s>

<s>tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every voter who can write .</s>

<s>with all these agencies , the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly .</s>

<s>no such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the State Department in anger .</s>

<s>in many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson .</s>

<s>after all , the money dispensed by State goes not to the farmer , the laborer , or the businessman , but to foreigners .</s>

<s>not only do these foreigners not vote for American congressmen ;
they are also probably ungrateful for Uncle's Sam's bounty .</s>

<s>and are not the State Department men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders who have never met a payroll ?</s>

<s>will not the righteous congressman be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with America and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes ?</s>

<s>the chances are excellent that he will .</s>

<s>the result is that the State Department's perpetual position before Congress is the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife .</s>

<s>people in this position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the newspapers .</s>

<s>State keeps the junketeering list a secret .</s>

<s>the Department expects and receives no thanks from Congress for its discretion .</s>

<s>Congress is a harsh master .</s>

<s>State is expected to arrange the touring Cicero's foreign itinerary ;
its embassies are expected to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way ;
embassy workers are expected to entertain him according to his whim , frequently with their savings for the children's college tuition .</s>

<s>but come the next session of Congress , State can expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand when it goes to the Capitol asking money for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for its diplomats .</s>

<s>the congressman who , in Paris , may have stuffed his wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of Notre-Dame will systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the Treasury .</s>

<s>in the matter of money State's most unrelenting watchdog during the Eisenhower years was Representative John J. Rooney , of Brooklyn , who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses .</s>

<s>diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence , not with Nikita Khrushchev , but with John Rooney .</s>

<s>nothing worked .</s>

<s>in the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of techniques they had tried to bring Rooney around -- friendly persuasion , groveling abasement , pressure subtly exerted through other powerful congressmen , tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic corps .</s>

<s>Rooney remained untouched .</s>

<s>the trouble , explained Loy Henderson , then Deputy Undersecretary for Administration , is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing , it always turns out that Rooney knows more about our budget than we do .</s>

<s>one year the Department collected a file of case histories to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's entertainment bills out of personal income .</s>

<s>news of the project reached the press .</s>

<s>next day , reports went through the Department that Rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances and had sworn an oath that , that year , expense allowances would not rise a dollar .</s>

<s>they didn't .</s>

<s>the Department's constant fight with the House for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic bloody engagements with the Senate .</s>

<s>armed with constitutional power to negate the Executive's foreign policy , the Senate carries a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the State Department's back , or on the head of the Secretary of State .</s>

<s>with its power to investigate , the Senate can paralyze the Secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees , as it did with Dean Acheson .</s>

<s>John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson , who was then operating the Senate , refused to let it become an Inquisition .</s>

<s>during Dulles's first two years in office , while Republicans ran the Senate , the Department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for its blood since 1945 .</s>

<s>an internal police operation managed by Scott McLeod , a former F.B.I.</s>

<s>man installed as security officer upon congressional insistence , was part of the vengeance .</s>

<s>so was the attack upon Charles E. Bohlen when Eisenhower appointed him Ambassador to Moscow .</s>

<s>the principal mauler , however , was Senator Joseph McCarthy .</s>

<s>where Acheson had fought a gallant losing battle for the Department , Dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates .</s>

<s>fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats , Dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men had their way .</s>

<s>in view of Eisenhower's reluctance to concede that anything was amiss in the Terror , it is doubtful that heroic intervention by Dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him and the country's foreign policy .</s>

<s>in any event , the example of Acheson's trampling by the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke it .</s>

<s>he elected to get along .</s>

<s>during this dark chapter in State Department history , men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to Capitol Hill .</s>

<s>their old errors of judgment were equated , in the curious logic of the time , with present treasonous intent .</s>

<s>their successors , absorbing the lesson , made it a point to have few ideas .</s>

<s>this , in turn , brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the Democrats took control .</s>

<s>in the new style , the Department was berated as intellectually barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit the Russians .</s>

<s>for three or four years in the mid-1950's , this complaint was heard rumbling up from the Senate floor whenever there was a dull legislative afternoon .</s>

<s>it became smart to say that the fault was with Dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by anyone but himself .</s>

<s>an equally tenable thesis is that the dearth of new thought was created by the Senate's own penchant for crucifying anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation .</s>

<s>getting along with foreigners
there are ninety-eight foreign embassies and legations in Washington .</s>

<s>they range from the Soviet Embassy on Sixteenth Street , a gray shuttered pile suggesting a funeral-accessories display house , to what Congressman Rooney has called that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth Street , the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the Belgians .</s>

<s>here is the world of the chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter , of caviar on stale crackers and the warm martini , of the poseur , the spy , the party crasher , and the patriot , of the rented tails , the double cross , and the tired Lothario .</s>

<s>into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions on how to handle Uncle Sam in an infinite variety of contingencies .</s>

<s>here are hatched plans for getting a share of the American bounty , the secret of the anti-missile missile , or an invitation to dinner .</s>

<s>out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside Washington .</s>

<s>they understood and teased me a bit about it .</s>

<s>I think I would have been much disappointed in Japan if I had not seen Kyoto , Nara , and Hiroshima .</s>

<s>here I was accompanied by Mrs. Okamoto ( Fumio's mother ) , her son , Mr. Washizu ( a prospective student with whom I have been corresponding for more than a year ) , and Mr. Nishima , one of the science teachers .</s>

<s>I arrived at 7:00 a.m. and by 9:00 a.m.</s>

<s>I had finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned .</s>

<s>we walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens .</s>

<s>we visited the Okamoto home -- where for the first time I saw the famous tea ceremony .</s>

<s>at 6:00 p.m. we went to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place where these beautiful dances originated .</s>

<s>they were even better than those of Tokyo -- more spectacular and more imaginative .</s>

<s>after a supper of unagi ( rice with eel -- eel which is raised in an ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt.</s>

<s>we started at 9 a.m. to visit the Kyoto University where Mr. Washizu is attending .</s>

<s>I was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities accompanying the medical school .</s>

<s>they apologized for the condition , including dirt and flies , and I was a little at a loss to know what to say .</s>

<s>there seemed to be no excuse ?</s>

<s>I don't have the answer yet .</s>

<s>we had tea at Mr. Washizu's home where I learned that he , too , comes from a very wealthy family .</s>

<s>his grandfather is a Buddhist priest ;
and he , being the eldest , was supposed to be a priest , but he chose to do differently , and one of his brothers is to become the priest .</s>

<s>this is a significant fact in Japan , for only a few years ago he would have had no choice .</s>

<s>in his big home live four families and thirty people , so it needs to be big .</s>

<s>Nara , Osaka , and Hiroshima
Mr. Nishima went with me on the train to Nara .</s>

<s>we passed his house and school on the way .</s>

<s>in Nara I stayed at the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed on their honeymoon .</s>

<s>a new red carpet had been laid for their coming , but I walked on it , too .</s>

<s>here Mr. Yoneda met us after a three-hour train trip from the town where he teaches .</s>

<s>even though we had walked miles in Kyoto that day , we started out again to see Nara at night .</s>

<s>in the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles to Osaka to put me on the train for Hiroshima .</s>

<s>again the plan was for me to go alone , but they wouldn't let me .</s>

<s>at Osaka , Mr. Yoneda had to leave us to get the train to his home , but Mr. Nishima and I had an hour and a half before train time to see Osaka at night .</s>

<s>it is the second largest city in Japan , with about four million people .</s>

<s>one spot in Osaka I shall always remember -- the bridge where we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the still waters of the river .</s>

<s>in the midst of a great busy city , people take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light .</s>

<s>my train arrived in Hiroshima at the awful hour of 4:45 a.m. .</s>

<s>I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little , after which Mr. Uno would arrive and pilot me around .</s>

<s>but there he was at the train with an Oregon State pennant in his hand .</s>

<s>I know now why the students insisted that I go to Hiroshima even when I told them I didn't want to .</s>

<s>they knew that I was still grieving over the tragic event , and they felt that if I could see the recovery and the spirit of the people , who hold no grudge , but who also regret Pearl Harbor , I would be happier and would understand better a new Japan .</s>

<s>there were no words to say this but there was no need .</s>

<s>the teachers of Mr. Uno's school gave me a small gift to thank me for coming .</s>

<s>Hiroshima is a better city than it was before -- in the minds of the people I met was a strong determination for peace and understanding .</s>

<s>I was grateful for their insight into my need for this experience .</s>

<s>a better world may yet come out of Hiroshima .</s>

<s>Tokyo
on arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who took us immediately to her university , the Japanese Women's University .</s>

<s>this day was Open House for Parents day , and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables .</s>

<s>everything was in an exciting turmoil -- full of anticipation and fun .</s>

<s>it was thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained teacher on Japanese students in a class in Home Planning .</s>

<s>our Masu is one of the very few architects in Japan who is trying to plan homes around family functions and women's needs .</s>

<s>I am told the time will soon come when women will find it necessary to do most of their own work , and even now it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants .</s>

<s>many of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in American homes , but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using Japanese artfulness in our own Western architecture at the same time that the Japanese are adopting Western utility patterns .</s>

<s>at this Women's University we find a monument to a courageous family who believed that Japanese women also should be educated .</s>

<s>even today there are some doubts about the value of education for Japanese women , but this University continues to grow and to send its students out into the community .</s>

<s>active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they can have their social gatherings and professional meetings .</s>

<s>as far as I am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found by educated women unafraid to break traditions .</s>

<s>Masu is also teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for Japanese widows in Tokyo .</s>

<s>here the women learn to keep house as maids ;
they become skilled in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests .</s>

<s>they learn how to take care of children and sick members of the family .</s>

<s>they have model kitchens , a sick room with a model patient in bed , and a nursery with a life-like doll .</s>

<s>although the training is only for one month , it is intensive and thorough .</s>

<s>graduates of this maid's school are much in demand and can always find work immediately .</s>

<s>occasionally they return for additional training .</s>

<s>Masu's home economics training comes into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for the storage of cleaning materials .</s>

<s>Masu also uses the training she got in an American home where she learned to polish furniture , clean corners , and work effectively in keeping a shiny house .</s>

<s>her education in the United States , not just in a classroom , but also in an American house with an American housekeeper , stands her in good stead .</s>

<s>University of Tokyo
after a fine luncheon in the cafeteria , the kitchen of which Masu had planned , Mr. Washizu and I left to meet representatives of the J for a visit to the University of Tokyo .</s>

<s>here again it was vacation time and there were many things I could not see , but I was able to visit with a professor who is famous in Japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant .</s>

<s>the achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following consultation between Attorney General Rogers and the heads of certain national chain stores should , of course , be applauded .</s>

<s>but for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case .</s>

<s>the suppositions in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing a connection between general company practice and local practice in the South , and by establishing such direct connection between the practice and the economic well-being of stores located in New York and general company policy .</s>

<s>then the boycott would not be secondary , but a primary one .</s>

<s>it would be directed against the actual location of the unjust policy which , for love's sake and for the sake of justice , must be removed , and , indivisible from this , to the economic injury of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy .</s>

<s>perhaps this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire national chain in order , by threatening potential injury to its entire economy , to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores in the matter of segregation .</s>

<s>such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminating instrument , and therefore of questionable justification .</s>

<s>action located where the evil is concentrated will prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate .</s>

<s>moreover , prudence alone would indicate that , unless the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed , the results of direct economic action everywhere upon national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage to local and state stores which conform to these customs , leading to greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company , or even ( as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure to correct injustice ) to its going out of business in certain sections of the country ( as , for that matter , the Quakers , who once had many meetings in the pre-Civil War South , largely went out of business in that part of the country over the slavery issue , never to recover a large number of southern adherents ) .</s>

<s>in any case , anyone who fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years ago or was skillfully organized by White Citizens' Councils in the entire state of Mississippi against every local Philco dealer in that state , in protest against a Philco-sponsored program over a national J network on which was presented a drama showing , it seemed , a high yellow gal smooching with a white man .</s>

<s>it is true , of course , that the end or objective of this action was different .</s>

<s>but since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals and concerning justice and injustice , and since , in a situation where direct action and economic pressure are called for , the justice of the matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not effectively present , there has to be a morality of means applied in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other forms of force .</s>

<s>the need that we not give unqualified approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the fact that White Citizens' Councils seem resolved to maintain segregation mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical violence .</s>

<s>an unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously brutal means .</s>

<s>the end or aim of the action , of course , is also important , especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person from stepping forward to claim his legal rights , e.g.</s>

<s>, against Negroes who register to vote in Fayette County , Tennessee , at the present moment .</s>

<s>here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance to those being despoiled , and to legal remedies .</s>

<s>this , however , is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and economic conflict ( if both sides are strong enough ) can be war of all against all no less than if other means are used .</s>

<s>it is also sufficient to show the Christian and any other champion of justice that he needs to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his conduct is just , i.e.</s>

<s>, that , if economic pressure has to be resorted to , this be applied directly against those persons directly in the way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices , while , if injury fall upon others , it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily ( however inevitably ) and not by deliberate intent and direct action against them .</s>

<s>it is clear that non-violent resistance is a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in Christian morality , like any other form of resistance .</s>

<s>the language used itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle for victory ( perhaps to be chosen above all others ) .</s>

<s>one of the sit-in leaders has said : nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom of Hell can stop the march to freedom .</s>

<s>everybody in the world today might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom is going to march over them .</s>

<s>the present writer certainly agrees with that statement , and would also affirm this -- in the order of justice .</s>

<s>however , it is also a Christian insight to know that unless charity interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches forward .</s>

<s>and when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for justice and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental good will .</s>

<s>it also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained above , and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent means .</s>

<s>R. B. Gregg has written that non-violence and good will of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical jiu-jitsu , to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance .</s>

<s>he suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent resistance of most victims would render him ;
and again , that the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object of war -- namely , to demoralize the opponent , to break his will , to destroy his confidence , enthusiasm , and hope .</s>

<s>in another respect it is dissimilar , for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is based on sounder values .</s>

<s>a trial of strength , however , is made quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder values than those of his opponent ;
and in warfare with any means , men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause .</s>

<s>this makes necessary a morality of means , and principles governing the conduct of resistance whenever this is thought to be justified .</s>

<s>the question , then , is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing him .</s>

<s>here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives ;
and to them it will seem insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently .</s>

<s>a technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression .</s>

<s>among Christian groups , the Mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the Christian use of all forms of pressure .</s>

<s>since the will and word of God are for them concentrated in Christ-like love , it seems clear to them that non-violent resistance is quite another thing .</s>

<s>the primary objective of non-violence , writes the outstanding Mennonite ethicist , is not peace , or obedience to the divine will , but rather certain desired social changes , for personal , or class , or national advantage .</s>

<s>without agreeing with every phrase in this statement , we must certainly assert the great difference between Christian love and any form of resistance , and then go on beyond the Mennonite position and affirm that Christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine the moral principles limiting resistance .</s>

<s>these principles we have now set forth .</s>

<s>economy in the use of power needs not only to be asserted , but clearly specified ;
and when this is done it will be found that the principles governing Christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and non-violent means , and apply to both alike , justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action .</s>

<s>economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a barely intolerable pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed .</s>

<s>that would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals .</s>

<s>there must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use of means of resistance , violent or non-violent .</s>

<s>the justification in Christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays down its limitation -- in the distinction between the persons against whom pressure is primarily directed , those upon whom it may be permitted also to fall , and those who may never be directly repressed for the sake even of achieving some great good .</s>

<s>in these terms , the economic withdrawal of the Negroes of Nashville , Tennessee , from trading in the center city , for example , was clearly justified , since these distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be singled out .</s>

<s>we may now take up for consideration a hard case which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above .</s>

<s>there may be instances in which , if economic pressure is to be undertaken at all , this would have to be applied without discrimination against a whole people .</s>

<s>an excellent article was published recently in the Journal Of The Church Peace Union by a South African journalist on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in South Africa , amounting to virtual slavery , and the economic complicity of both the government and the people of the United States in these conditions .</s>

<s>billions of American dollars , not only from capital investors but also from the pockets of U.S. taxpayers , this author states , are being poured into South Africa to support a system dedicated to the oppression , the persecution , and the almost diabolical exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens not to be white .</s>

<s>both the conditions and the complicity are documented in considerable detail .</s>

<s>this leads to the conclusion that the fact is inescapable that America does have a say in whether or not apartheid shall continue .</s>

<s>our leadership in a wide economic boycott of South Africa would be not only in accord , it seems , with the moral conscience of America , not to be denied because we also as a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our own country , but also in accord with our law , U.S. Code Title 19 , Section 1307 , which forbids the importation of goods made by forced or convict labor .</s>

<s>not only should this provision be enforced but other economic and political actions might be taken which , this author believes , must surely be supported by every American who values the freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly contribute to the enslavement of another nation .</s>

<s>northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration .</s>

<s>they have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state .</s>

<s>and both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners who are called Bourbons .</s>

<s>the name presumably derives from the French royal house which never learned and never forgot ;
since Bourbon whiskey , though of Kentucky origin , is at least as much favored by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South .</s>

<s>the nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North .</s>

<s>the race problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive .</s>

<s>it is these other differences between North and South -- other , that is , than those which concern discrimination or social welfare -- which I chiefly discuss herein .</s>

<s>I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience .</s>

<s>a Southerner married to a New Englander , I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists , writers , publicity men , and business executives of egghead tastes .</s>

<s>most of them are Democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed as , liberals .</s>

<s>this is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson , who held that the best government was the least government .</s>

<s>yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints .</s>

<s>when I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , I find that they fall into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis ;
and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things don't count any more in the world of to-day .</s>

<s>I am naive , they say , to make use of such words .</s>

<s>I take this to mean that the intelligent -- and therefore necessarily cynical ?</s>

<s>-- liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it .</s>

<s>this seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a President of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme Court .</s>

<s>as for states' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms .</s>

<s>the American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ;
but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one .</s>

<s>why , in the first place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ?</s>

<s>if he attaches little importance to personal liberty , why not make this known to the world ?</s>

<s>and if he is so scornful of the rights of states , why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support ?</s>

<s>I am concerned here , however , with the Northern liberal's attitude toward the South .</s>

<s>it appears to be one of intense dislike , which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends .</s>

<s>his assumption seems to be that any such friends , being tolerable humans , must be more liberal than most Southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views .</s>

<s>Time's editor , Thomas Griffith , in his book , The Waist-High Culture , wrote : most of what was different about it ( the Deep South ) I found myself unsympathetic to .</s>

<s>this , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement .</s>

<s>theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism .</s>

<s>I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North .</s>

<s>in business circles , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found .</s>

<s>but in our case -- and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts -- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking several more .</s>

<s>in fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down .</s>

<s>accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view .</s>

<s>but these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee-hatred displayed in social gatherings .</s>

<s>from my wife's experience and other sources , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles .</s>

<s>the strong feeling is certainly there ;
but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the South , especially among those who studied in the North .</s>

<s>and social relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy , if not sympathy , toward resident and visiting Northerners .</s>

<s>also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems .</s>

<s>there are of course many Souths ;
but for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who haven't .</s>

<s>my definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War .</s>

<s>nobody knows how many Southerners there are in this category .</s>

<s>I suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to believe .</s>

<s>I never heard of a poll being taken on the question .</s>

<s>no doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic .</s>

<s>prior to 1954 I imagine that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy .</s>

<s>since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is more doubtful ;
and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would have been for the Old South .</s>

<s>belief in the traditional way of life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones .</s>

<s>probably a larger percentage of Virginians and South Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with Georgia , North Carolina , and Alabama following along after them .</s>

<s>old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont ;
so that a line running down the length of the South marking the upper limits of tidewater would roughly divide the Old South from the new , but with , of course , important minority enclaves .</s>

<s>the long-settled areas of states like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater .</s>

<s>also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West Indies than with the North even after independence .</s>

<s>the social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area .</s>

<s>in certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South .</s>

<s>poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country .</s>

<s>and no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown .</s>

<s>among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors .</s>

<s>all Southerners agree that slavery had to go ;
but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did .</s>

<s>southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and Reconstruction ;
their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties .</s>

<s>but apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed South -- to use the moderate words favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith -- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North .</s>

<s>and this , in effect , means most of modern America .</s>

<s>it is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise .</s>

<s>and therein , I feel , many Northerners delude themselves about the South .</s>

<s>for one thing , this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed .</s>

<s>there seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it .</s>

<s>I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful thinking : don't talk about the final stages of Reconstruction and they will take care of themselves .</s>

<s>or else the North really believes that all Southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past , and are now at heart sharers of the American Dream , like everybody else .</s>

<s>if the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true .</s>

<s>the situation of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western world .</s>

<s>regardless of rights and wrongs , a population and an area appropriate to a pre-World-War- 1 great power have been , following conquest , ruled against their will by a neighboring people , and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike .</s>

<s>and the great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent .</s>

<s>this is the only case in modern history of a people of Britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination .</s>

<s>the fact is due mainly to international wars , both hot and cold .</s>

<s>in every war of the United States since the Civil War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country .</s>

<s>so instead of being tests of the South's loyalty , the Spanish War , the two World Wars , and the Korean War all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion .</s>

<s>and there is no section of the nation more ardent than the South in the cold war against Communism .</s>

<s>had the situation been reversed , had , for instance , England been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New England , there is little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would have happily put on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain .</s>

<s>it is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners should have been as docile as they have .</s>

<s>the North should thank its stars that such has been the case ;
but at the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom .</s>

<s>the two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries .</s>

<s>there is much truth in both these charges , and not many Bourbons deny them .</s>

<s>whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites .</s>

<s>most of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure .</s>

<s>many Northeners believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly .</s>

<s>the Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives .</s>

<s>but those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this .</s>

<s>they believe that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America .</s>

<s>as it is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the American way has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter .</s>

<s>the South's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure .</s>

<s>their own easier , slower tempo is especially dear to Southerners ;
and I have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town .</s>

<s>in the past , the duties of the state , as Sir Henry Maine noted long ago , were only two in number : internal order and external security .</s>

<s>by prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men , the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders .</s>

<s>outside those limits it asserted , as against other states , a position of sovereign equality , and , as against the inferior peoples of the non-Western world , a position of dominance .</s>

<s>it became the sole subject of international law ( a term which , it is pertinent to remember , was coined by Bentham ) , a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western nations could do in the world arena .</s>

<s>( that corpus of law was a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries .</s>

<s>speaking generally , it furthered -- and still tends to further -- the interests of the Western powers .</s>

<s>the enormous changes in world politics have , however , thrown it into confusion , so much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era .
)</s>

<s>beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above , no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility , either internally or externally .</s>

<s>this was particularly true in the world arena , which was an anarchical battleground characterized by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires .</s>

<s>that any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman .</s>

<s>his duty was to his sovereign and to his nation , and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be contemplated .</s>

<s>thus , to cite but one example , the Pax Britannica of the nineteenth century , whether with the British navy ruling the seas or with the City of London ruling world finance , was strictly national in motivation , however much other nations ( e.g.</s>

<s>, the United States ) may have incidentally benefited .</s>

<s>at the same time , all suggestions that some sort of societal responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly resisted .</s>

<s>social Darwinism was able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century .</s>

<s>however , in recent decades , for what doubtless are multiple reasons , an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has occurred in both facets of national activity .</s>

<s>a concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment .</s>

<s>already firmly implanted internally , it is a growing factor in external matters .</s>

<s>a little more than twenty years ago the American people turned an important corner .</s>

<s>in what has aptly been called a constitutional revolution , the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature ( the night-watchman state ) to one with affirmative duties to perform .</s>

<s>the positive state came into existence .</s>

<s>for lawyers , reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences , there has been a special fascination since then in the role played by the Supreme Court in that transformation -- the manner in which its decisions altered in the switch in time that saved nine , President Roosevelt's ill-starred but in effect victorious Court-packing plan , the imprimatur of judicial approval that was finally placed upon social legislation .</s>

<s>of greater importance , however , is the content of those programs , which have had and are having enormous consequences for the American people .</s>

<s>labor relations have been transformed , income security has become a standardized feature of political platforms , and all the many facets of the American version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom .</s>

<s>a national consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary .</s>

<s>ratified in the Republican Party victory in 1952 , the Positive State is now evidenced by political campaigns being waged not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be .</s>

<s>the general acceptance of the idea of governmental ( i.e.</s>

<s>, societal ) responsibility for the economic well-being of the American people is surely one of the two most significant watersheds in American constitutional history .</s>

<s>the other , of course , was the Civil War , the conflict which a century ago insured national unity over fragmentation .</s>

<s>a third , one of at least equal and perhaps even greater importance , is now being traversed : American immersion and involvement in world affairs .</s>

<s>internal national responsibility , now a truism , need not be documented .</s>

<s>nevertheless , it may be helpful to cite one example -- that of employment -- for , as will be shown below , it cuts across both facets of the new concept .</s>

<s>thirty years ago , while the nation was wallowing in economic depression , the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow natural forces to operate and cure the distress .</s>

<s>that guiding principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the New Deal ;
less than a score of years later Congress enacted the Employment Act of 1946 , by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment .</s>

<s>hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning -- the economic side of the constitutional revolution .</s>

<s>in 1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy Administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a state's-responsibility proposal -- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted with manpower surplus .</s>

<s>the American people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961 .</s>

<s>internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the Industrial Revolution .</s>

<s>reduced to its simplest terms , it is an assumption of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals to cope with the rigors of the era .</s>

<s>national responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the United States or even to the Western nations .</s>

<s>a measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived from a statement of the International Congress of Jurists in 1959 .</s>

<s>meeting in New Delhi under the auspices of the International Commission of Jurists , a body of lawyers from the free world , the Congress redefined and expanded the traditional Rule of Law to include affirmative governmental duties .</s>

<s>it is noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the Congress were from the less developed , former colonial nations .</s>

<s>the Rule of Law , historically a principle according everyone his day in court before an impartial tribunal , was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare .</s>

<s>recognizing that the Rule of Law is a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society , the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility to establish social , economic , educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized .</s>

<s>the idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-Soviet world .</s>

<s>for better or for worse , we all now live in welfare states , the organizing principle of which is collective responsibility for individual well-being .</s>

<s>whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish .</s>

<s>the hypothesis ventured here is that it does , and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition .</s>

<s>the content is not the same , however : rather than individual security , it is the security and continuing existence of an ideological group -- those in the free world -- that is basic .</s>

<s>external national responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of the Western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability of other friendly nations .</s>

<s>if internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality , then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism .</s>

<s>reference to two other concepts -- nationalism and sovereignty -- may help to reveal the contours of the new principle .</s>

<s>in its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself -- internally , against feudal groups , and externally , against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church .</s>

<s>the breakup of the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led , not more than two centuries ago , to the surge of nationalism .</s>

<s>( since the time-span of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence of the United States as an independent entity , it is perhaps natural for Americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest form of order , something permanent and unchanging .
)</s>

<s>the concept of nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure .</s>

<s>but it is more than that .</s>

<s>for it includes the emotional ties that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large group of people together as a unit .</s>

<s>today , as new nations rise from the former colonial empires , nationalism is one of the hurricane forces loose in the world .</s>

<s>almost febrile in intensity , the principle has become worldwide in application -- unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm .</s>

<s>historically , however , the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the Western civilizational group .</s>

<s>by subduing disparate lesser groups the nation has , to some degree at least , broadened the capacity for individual liberty .</s>

<s>within their confines , moreover , technological and industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace , thus increasing the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied .</s>

<s>while the pattern is uneven , some having gained more than others , nationalism has in fact served the Western peoples well .</s>

<s>( whether historical nationalism helped the peoples of the remainder of the world , and whether today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial aspects , are other questions .
)</s>

<s>it is one of the ironic quirks of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that the nation-state attained its highest number ( approximately 100 ) .</s>

<s>but it is more than irony : one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the planet .</s>

<s>in other words , nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application , both as to geography and as to population ;
it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis .</s>

<s>complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty .</s>

<s>the former receives its legitimacy from the latter .</s>

<s>operating side by side , together they helped shore up the nation-state .</s>

<s>while sovereignty has roots in antiquity , in its present usage it is essentially modern .</s>

<s>Jean Bodin , writing in the sixteenth century , may have been the seminal thinker , but it was the vastly influential John Austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now understood .</s>

<s>Austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking .</s>

<s>to him , law is the command of the sovereign ( the English monarch ) who personifies the power of the nation , while sovereignty is the power to make law -- i.e.</s>

<s>, to prevail over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations .</s>

<s>these fundamental ideas -- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual ( internal-external ) aspects -- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power .</s>

<s>the nation-state , then , exemplifies the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty : supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control .</s>

<s>in fact , however , both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined .</s>

<s>high-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision .</s>

<s>that is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies , in which popular sovereignty is said to exist , and in federal nations , in which the jobs of government are split .</s>

<s>nevertheless , nationalism and sovereignty are reputed , in the accepted wisdom , to describe the modern world .</s>

<s>is there a different reality behind the facade ?</s>

<s>does the surface hide a quite different picture ?</s>

<s>the short answer to those questions is yes .</s>

<s>both concepts are undergoing alteration ;
to some degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility .</s>

<s>as evidence to support that view , consider the following illustrative instances .</s>

<s>can thermonuclear war be set off by accident ?</s>

<s>what steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents ?</s>

<s>are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ?</s>

<s>is anything being done to increase our margin of safety ?</s>

<s>will the danger increase or decrease ?</s>

<s>I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon , in the White House , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as Sherwood Forest .</s>

<s>I asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the commit buttons that could start a war -- accidentally or by design -- and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons .</s>

<s>to the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched .</s>

<s>there is unceasing pressure , but its sources are immediate .</s>

<s>readiness exercises are almost continuous .</s>

<s>each could be the real thing .</s>

<s>in the command centers there are special clocks ready to tick off the minutes elapsed since J hour .</s>

<s>E stands for execution -- the moment a go order would unleash an American nuclear strike .</s>

<s>there is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks .</s>

<s>they are preoccupied riding herd on control panels , switches , flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business machines .</s>

<s>they know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details .</s>

<s>accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks .</s>

<s>among the policy makers , generals , physicists , psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their hardware , the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call scenarios .</s>

<s>as an Air Force psychiatrist put it : you can't have dry runs on this one .</s>

<s>the experts are thus forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occurred , probably never will -- but possibly might .</s>

<s>only one rule prevailed in my conversations with these men : the more highly placed they are -- that is , the more they know -- the more concerned they have become .</s>

<s>already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the Kennedy Administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security .</s>

<s>only recently new holes were discovered in our safety measures , and a search is now on for more .</s>

<s>work is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons .</s>

<s>meanwhile , the experts speak of wars triggered by false pre-emption , escalation , unauthorized behavior and other terms that will be discussed in this report .</s>

<s>they inhabit a secret world centered on go codes and gold phones .</s>

<s>their conversations were , almost invariably , accompanied by the same gestures -- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions .</s>

<s>one arm represented our bombers and missiles , the other arm theirs .</s>

<s>yet implicit in each movement was the death of millions , perhaps hundreds of millions , perhaps you and me -- and the experts .</s>

<s>these men are not callous .</s>

<s>it is their job to think about the unthinkable .</s>

<s>unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us -- and more Russians and Communist Chinese , too -- thought about accidental war .</s>

<s>the first systematic thinking about this Pandora's box within Pandora's boxes was done four years ago by Fred Ikle , a frail , meek-mannered Swiss-born sociologist .</s>

<s>he was , and is , with the J Corporation , a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the U.S. Air Force .</s>

<s>his investigations made him the Paul Revere of accidental war , and safety procedures were enormously increased .</s>

<s>in recent weeks , as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the Kennedy Administration , basic United States strategy has been modified -- and large new sums allocated -- to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible .</s>

<s>the chain starts at J ( Ballistic Missile Early Warning System ) in Thule , Greenland .</s>

<s>its radar screens would register Soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the United States .</s>

<s>BMEWS intelligence is simultaneously flashed to J ( North American Air Defense Command ) in Colorado Springs , Colorado , for interpretation ;
to the J command and control post , forty-five feet below the ground at Offutt Air Force Base , near Omaha , Nebraska ;
to the Joint War Room of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon and to the President .</s>

<s>telephones , Teletypes , several kinds of radio systems and , in some cases , television , link all vital points .</s>

<s>alternate locations exist for all key command centers .</s>

<s>for last-ditch emergencies J has alternate command posts on J jet tankers .</s>

<s>multiple circuits , routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible .</s>

<s>the same principle of redundancy applies to all communications on these special networks .</s>

<s>and no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance , by special codes , that the messages actually come from their purported sources .</s>

<s>additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications .</s>

<s>only the President is permitted to authorize the use of nuclear weapons .</s>

<s>that's the law .</s>

<s>but what if somebody decides to break it ?</s>

<s>the President cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger .</s>

<s>he makes the momentous decision .</s>

<s>hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons .</s>

<s>what if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly , coolly , decide to clobber the Russians ?</s>

<s>what if the President himself , in the language of the military , goes ape ?</s>

<s>or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets without provocation ?</s>

<s>nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers .</s>

<s>however , the system is designed , ingeniously and hopefully , so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war .</s>

<s>even the President cannot pick up his telephone and give a go order .</s>

<s>even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike -- the go code .</s>

<s>in an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the gold-phone circuit .</s>

<s>a system of gold -- actually yellow -- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of the Secretary of Defense , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the J commander and other key men .</s>

<s>all can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes .</s>

<s>all could help the President make his decision .</s>

<s>the talk would not be in code , but neither would it ramble .</s>

<s>vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda .</s>

<s>officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the President's decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from J .</s>

<s>if communications work , his decision would be instantly known in all command posts that would originate the actual go order .</s>

<s>for these centers , too , are on the gold circuit .</s>

<s>they include the Navy's Atlantic Command at Norfolk , Virginia , which is in contact with the Polaris subs ;
J headquarters in Europe ;
Air Force forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific , which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases ;
and J , which controls long-range bombers and Atlas missiles .</s>

<s>let us look in on one of these nerve centers -- J at Omaha -- and see what must still happen before a wing of J bombers could drop their J .</s>

<s>in a word , plenty .</s>

<s>the key man almost certainly would be Col. William W. Wisman , J senior controller .</s>

<s>he or his deputy or one of their seven assistants , all full colonels , mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day .</s>

<s>it is a quiet but impressive room -- 140 feet long , thirty-nine feet wide , twenty-one feet high .</s>

<s>movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts are crammed with intelligence information .</s>

<s>and Bill Wisman , forty-three , a farmer's son from Beallsville , Ohio , is a quiet but impressive man .</s>

<s>his eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown .</s>

<s>his movements and speech are precise , clear and quick .</s>

<s>no question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate .</s>

<s>Wisman , who has had the chief controller's job for four years , calls the signals for a team operating three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights , switches and buttons .</s>

<s>at least a dozen men , some armed , are never far away from him .</s>

<s>in front of him is a gold phone .</s>

<s>in emergencies the J commander , Gen. Thomas Power , or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above Wisman and his staff .</s>

<s>at General Power's seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone .</s>

<s>General Power would participate in the decision making .</s>

<s>Wisman , below , would listen in and act .</s>

<s>his consoles can give him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and with every J aircraft .</s>

<s>he need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left , right next to the big red button marked alert .</s>

<s>( there are two receivers in case one should be dropped and damaged .
)</s>

<s>but Wisman , too , does not know the go code .</s>

<s>he must take it from the red box .</s>

<s>in point of fact , this is a beige box with a bright red door , about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to Wisman's right .</s>

<s>the box is internally wired so the door can never be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon ( it's real obnoxious ) .</s>

<s>now we must become vague , for we are approaching one of the nation's most guarded secrets .</s>

<s>the codes in the red box -- there are several of them covering various contingencies -- are contained in a sealed J unique device .</s>

<s>they are supplied , a batch at a time , by a secret source and are continually changed by Wisman or his staff , at random intervals .</s>

<s>but even the contents of Wisman's box cannot start a war .</s>

<s>they are mere fragments , just one portion of preprepared messages .</s>

<s>what these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed .</s>

<s>the pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman's staff .</s>

<s>in addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages , again in special codes , each message also contains an internal authenticator , another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing .</s>

<s>I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one .</s>

<s>I'd wind up full of .38 bullet holes , he said , and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers .</s>

<s>now let us imagine a wing of J , on alert near their positive control ( or fail-safe ) points , the spots on the map , many miles from Soviet territory , beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets .</s>

<s>they , too , have fragments of the go code with them .</s>

<s>as Wisman put it , they have separate pieces of the pie , and we have the whole pie .</s>

<s>once we send out the whole pie , they can put their pieces into it .</s>

<s>unless we send out the whole pie , their pieces mean nothing .</s>

<s>why does Wisman's ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers ?</s>

<s>the answer is a cryptographic secret .</s>

<s>at any rate , three men out of a six-man J crew are required to copy down Wisman's go-to-war message .</s>

<s>each must match Wisman's pie with the fragment that he carries with him .</s>

<s>all three must compare notes and agree to go .</s>

<s>after that , it requires several minutes of concentrated work , including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber , each with another man beside him to help , for an armed bomb to be released .</s>

<s>unless all gadgets are properly operated -- and the wires and seals from the handles removed first -- no damage can be done .</s>

<s>suddenly , however , their posture changed and the game ended .</s>

<s>they went as rigid as black statuary six figures , lean and tall and angular , went still .</s>

<s>their heads were in the air sniffing .</s>

<s>they all swung at the same instant in the same direction .</s>

<s>they saw it before I did , even with my binoculars .</s>

<s>it was nothing more than a tiny distant rain squall , a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth .</s>

<s>in the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree , no more .</s>

<s>a white man would not have seen it .</s>

<s>the aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos .</s>

<s>watching , they waited until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land .</s>

<s>at once the whole band set off at a lope .</s>

<s>they were chasing a rain cloud .</s>

<s>they went after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow .</s>

<s>I followed them in the jeep and now they did not care .</s>

<s>the games were over , this was life .</s>

<s>occasionally , for no reason that I could see , they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot .</s>

<s>sometimes I guessed it was because the rain squall had changed direction .</s>

<s>sometimes it was to skirt a gulley .</s>

<s>their gait is impossible to convey in words .</s>

<s>it has nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner about it , it is not a lope , it is not done with style or verve .</s>

<s>it is the gait of the human who must run to live : arms dangling , legs barely swinging over the ground , head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target , a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful .</s>

<s>it is a barely controlled skimming of the ground .</s>

<s>they ran for three hours .</s>

<s>finally , avoiding hummocks and seeking low ground , they intercepted the rain squall .</s>

<s>for ten minutes they ran beneath the squall , raising their arms and , for the first time , shouting and capering .</s>

<s>then the wind died and the rain squall held steady .</s>

<s>they were studying the ground .</s>

<s>suddenly one of them shouted , ran a few feet , bent forward and put his mouth to the ground .</s>

<s>he had found a depression with rain water in it .</s>

<s>he bent down , a black cranelike figure , and put his mouth to the ground .</s>

<s>with a lordly and generous gesture , the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows .</s>

<s>the other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle .</s>

<s>in an instant he had sucked it dry .</s>

<s>the aborigine lives on the cruelest land I have ever seen .</s>

<s>which does not mean that it is ugly .</s>

<s>part of it is , of course .</s>

<s>there are thousands of square miles of salt pan which are hideous .</s>

<s>they are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil left , but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand .</s>

<s>such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality .</s>

<s>but much of the land which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable .</s>

<s>it is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush , has a peaceful quality , the hills roll softly .</s>

<s>the malignancy of such a landscape has been beautifully described by the Australian Charles Bean .</s>

<s>he tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock , a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer .</s>

<s>they went well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the outback country .</s>

<s>the countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps .</s>

<s>nothing appalling or horrible rushed upon these men .</s>

<s>only there happened -- nothing .</s>

<s>there might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps : only -- there was not .</s>

<s>it might have rained , any time ;
only -- it did not .</s>

<s>there might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise ;
only -- there was not .</s>

<s>they lay , with the birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them .</s>

<s>no one came .</s>

<s>the white men died .</s>

<s>and countless others like them have died .</s>

<s>even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction , were tortured by the heat , driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape , and who finally died .</s>

<s>the aborigine is not deceived ;
he knows that the land is hard and pitiless .</s>

<s>he knows that the economy of life in the outback is awful .</s>

<s>there is no room for error or waste .</s>

<s>any organism that falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done .</s>

<s>I do not know if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge , but I suspect that it can .</s>

<s>perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his odd air of dignity .</s>

<s>the family at the boulder
seeing an aborigine today is a difficult thing .</s>

<s>many of them have drifted into the cities and towns and seaports .</s>

<s>others are confined to vast reservations , and not only does the Australian government justifiably not wish them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo , but on their reservations they are extremely fugitive , shunning camps , coming together only for corroborees at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch -- which is very low indeed .</s>

<s>I persuaded an Australian friend who had lived outback for years to take me to see some aborigines living in the bush .</s>

<s>it was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation , even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their language .</s>

<s>finally , however , the arrangements were made and we drove out into the bush in a Land Rover .</s>

<s>we followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth .</s>

<s>the rancher went a mile down this road and then , when he reached a big red boulder , swung off the road .</s>

<s>at once he started to glance toward the instrument panel .</s>

<s>it took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel : there was a gimbaled compass welded to it , which rocked gently back and forth as the Land Rover bounced about .</s>

<s>the rancher was navigating his way across the flatland .</s>

<s>do you always navigate like this ?</s>

<s>I asked .</s>

<s>damned right , he said .</s>

<s>once I get out on the flat I do .</s>

<s>some chaps that know an area well can make their way by landmarks , a tree here , a wash here , a boulder there .</s>

<s>but if you don't know the place like the palm of your hand , you'd better use a compass and the speedometer .</s>

<s>two miles northeast , then five miles southwest that sort of thing .</s>

<s>very simple .</s>

<s>he was right .</s>

<s>the landscape kept repeating itself .</s>

<s>I would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was hopeless .</s>

<s>finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines .</s>

<s>they were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder : a man , his lubra , and two children .</s>

<s>the sun was not yet high and all of them were in the small area of shade cast by the boulder .</s>

<s>there was also a dog , a dingo dog .</s>

<s>its ribs showed , it was a yellow nondescript color , it suffered from a variety of sores , hair had scabbed off its body in patches .</s>

<s>it lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving , watching us carefully .</s>

<s>it struck me as a very bright and very malnourished dog .</s>

<s>no one patted the dog .</s>

<s>it was not a pet .</s>

<s>it was a worker .</s>

<s>the buggers love shade , the rancher said .</s>

<s>I suppose because it saves them some loss of body water .</s>

<s>they'll move around that rock all day , following the shade .</s>

<s>during the hottest part of the day , of course , the sun comes straight down and there isn't any shade .</s>

<s>we drove close to the boulder , stopped the Land Rover , and walked over toward the family .</s>

<s>the man was leaning against the rock .</s>

<s>he gazed away from us as we approached .</s>

<s>he was over six feet tall and very thin .</s>

<s>his legs were narrow and very long .</s>

<s>every bone and muscle in his body showed , but he did not give the appearance of starving .</s>

<s>he had long black hair and a wispy beard .</s>

<s>the ridges over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut .</s>

<s>there was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what .</s>

<s>it was not merely that flies were crawling over his face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into his eye sockets .</s>

<s>a fly would crawl down the bulging forehead , into the socket of the eye , walk along the man's lashes and across the wet surface of the eyeball , and the eye did not blink .</s>

<s>the Australian and I both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered by insects , but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine .</s>

<s>I turned to look at the lubra .</s>

<s>she remained squatting on her heels all the time we were there ;
like the man , she was entirely naked .</s>

<s>her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possessions which were placed in front of her .</s>

<s>there were two rubbing sticks for making fire , two stones shaped roughly like knives , a woven-root container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead body of some rodent .</s>

<s>there was also a long wooden spear and a woomera , a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity and high accuracy .</s>

<s>there was also a boomerang , elaborately carved .</s>

<s>everything was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless .</s>

<s>the two children , both boys , wandered around the Australian and me for a few moments and then returned to their work .</s>

<s>they squatted on their heels with their heads bent far forward , their eyes only a few inches from the ground .</s>

<s>they had located the runway of a colony of ants and as the ants came out of the ground , the boys picked them up , one at a time , and pinched them dead .</s>

<s>the tiny bodies , dropped onto a dry leaf , made a pile as big as a small apple .</s>

<s>the odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines .</s>

<s>the smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant .</s>

<s>it was also subtly familiar , for it was the odor of the human body , but multiplied innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed .</s>

<s>one's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant .</s>

<s>but that is a cliche and a dishonest one .</s>

<s>the smell is sexual , but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it .</s>

<s>their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin .</s>

<s>they roll at night in ashes to keep warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it .</s>

<s>in spots such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and I realized the aborigines were much darker than they appeared ;
as if the coating of sweat , dirt , and ashes were a cosmetic .</s>

<s>the boys had beautiful dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies and blinked their eyes .</s>

<s>that smell is something , eh , mate ?</s>

<s>the Australian asked .</s>

<s>they swear that every person smells different and every family smells different from every other .</s>

<s>at the corroborees , when they get to dancing and sweating , you'll see them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a specially good smell .</s>

<s>Idje , here , and he nodded at the man , is said to have great odor .</s>

<s>the stink is all the same to me , but I really think they can make one another out blindfolded .</s>

<s>here , Idje , you fella like tabac ?</s>

<s>he said sharply .</s>

<s>Idje still stared over our shoulders at the horizon .</s>

<s>the Australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin I could understand , and spoke strange words from deep in his chest .</s>

<s>it was a fortunate time in which to build , for the seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art .</s>

<s>the architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through Abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city .</s>

<s>travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion : a great garden filled with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes .</s>

<s>at the heart of all of this was the square , which one such traveler declared to be as spacious , as pleasant and aromatick a Market as any in the Universe .</s>

<s>in time Isfahan came to be known as half the world , Isfahan nisf-i-jahan .</s>

<s>in the early eighteenth century this fantastic city , then the size of London , started to decline .</s>

<s>the Afghans invaded ;
the Safavids fell from power ;
the capital went elsewhere ;
the desert encroached .</s>

<s>Isfahan became more of a legend than a place , and now it is for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of old Persia and sometimes of the East .</s>

<s>they think of it as a kind of spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor .</s>

<s>those who actually get there find that it isn't spooky at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight .</s>

<s>but even for them it remains a museum , or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb , a tomb in which Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead .</s>

<s>everyone is ready to grant the Persians their history , but almost no one is willing to acknowledge their present .</s>

<s>it seems that for Persia , and especially for this city , there are only two times : the glorious past and the corrupt , depressing , sterile present .</s>

<s>the one apparent connection between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other have survived and which naturally enough are called historical monuments .</s>

<s>however , just as all the buildings have not fallen and flowed back to their original mud , so the values which wanted them and saw that they were built have not all disappeared .</s>

<s>the values and talents which made the tile and the dome , the rug , the poem and the miniature , continue in certain social institutions which rise above the ordinary life of this city , as the great buildings rise above blank walls and dirty lanes .</s>

<s>often , too , the social institutions are housed in these pavilions and palaces and bridges , for these great structures are not simply historical monuments ;
they are the places where Persians live .</s>

<s>the promenade , for example , continues to take place on the Chahar Bagh , a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees that now serves as the city's principal street .</s>

<s>?</s>

<s>it takes place as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the Khaju bridge , and also in the gardens of the square .</s>

<s>on Fridays , the day when many Persians relax with poetry , talk , and a samovar , people do not , it is true , stream into Chehel Sotun -- a pavilion and garden built by Shah Abbas 2 in the seventeenth century -- but they do retire into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley , which are smaller , more humble copies of the former .</s>

<s>and of course religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques , and commercial life -- very much a social institution -- in the bazaar .</s>

<s>those three other great activities of the Persians , the bath , the teahouse , and the zur khaneh ( the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics , dance , chanted poetry , and music ) , do not take place in buildings to which entrance tickets are sold , but some of them occupy splendid examples of Persian domestic architecture : long , domed , chalk-white rooms with daises of turquoise tile , their end walls cut through to the orchards and the sky by open arches .</s>

<s>but more important , and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see , is that these places and activities are often the settings in which Persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities .</s>

<s>water , air , fruit , poetry , music , the human form -- these things are important to Persians , and they experience them with an intense and discriminating awareness .</s>

<s>I should like , by the way , to make it clear that I am not using the word Persians carelessly .</s>

<s>I don't mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations , like a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool .</s>

<s>these things are important to almost all Persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary .</s>

<s>the men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's night are as often as not the lutihaw , mustachioed toughs who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons , brothels , and teahouses .</s>

<s>a few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor .</s>

<s>not long ago an acquaintance , a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw of the city , stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks .</s>

<s>the air , he said , was just right ;
a cigarette would taste particularly good .</s>

<s>I really didn't know what he meant .</s>

<s>it was a nice day , granted .</s>

<s>but he knew ;
he sniffed the air and licked it on his lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage .</s>

<s>the natural world then , plus poetry and some kinds of art , receives from the most ordinary of Persians a great deal of attention .</s>

<s>the line of an eyebrow , the color of the skin , a ghazal from Hafiz , the purity of spring water , the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of a pavilion -- these things are noticed , judged , and valued .</s>

<s>nowhere in Isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the Persians shown so well as during the promenade at the Khaju bridge .</s>

<s>there has probably always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city .</s>

<s>for one thing , there is a natural belt of rock across the river bed ;
for another , it was here that one of the old caravan routes came in .</s>

<s>it was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans , and also to make a pleasance for the city , that Shah Abbas 2 in about 1657 built , of sun-baked brick , tile , and stone , the present bridge .</s>

<s>it is a splendid structure .</s>

<s>from upstream it looks like a long arcaded box laid across the river ;
from downstream , where the water level is much lower , it is a high , elaborately facaded pavilion .</s>

<s>the top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile .</s>

<s>at either end and in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed and capacious as church apses .</s>

<s>here , in the old days -- when they had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks -- sat the king and his court while priests , soldiers , and other members of the party lounged in the smaller alcoves between .</s>

<s>below , twenty vaults tunnel through the understructure of the bridge .</s>

<s>these are traversed by another line of vaults , and thus rooms , arched on all four sides , are formed .</s>

<s>down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers and arches , while the vaults fronting upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise , the mountains and river pools .</s>

<s>here , on the hottest day , it is cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the vaults .</s>

<s>on the downstream , or pavilion , side these vaults give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself .</s>

<s>from the terraces -- eighteen in all -- broad flights of steps descend into the water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river .</s>

<s>out of water , brick , and tile they have made far more than just a bridge .</s>

<s>on spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge .</s>

<s>it is a great spectacle .</s>

<s>the bridge itself rises up from the river , light-flared and enormous , like the outdoor set for an epic opera .</s>

<s>crowds press along the terraces , down the steps , in and out of the arcades , massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege .</s>

<s>all kinds come to walk in the promenade : merchants from the bazaar bickering over a deal ;
a Bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket ;
dervishes who stand with the stillness of the blind , their eyes filmed with rheum and visions ;
the old Kajar princes arriving in their ancient limousines ;
students , civil servants , beggars , musicians , hawkers , and clowns .</s>

<s>Families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on carpets around a samovar .</s>

<s>below , people line the steps , as though on bleachers , to watch the sky and river .</s>

<s>above , in the tiled prosceniums of the alcoves , boys sing the ghazals of Hafiz and Saadi , while at the very bottom , in the vaults , the toughs and blades of the city hoot and bang their drums , drink arak , play dice , and dance .</s>

<s>here in an evening Persians enjoy many of the things which are important to them : poetry , water , the moon , a beautiful face .</s>

<s>to a stranger their delight in these things may seem paradoxical , for Persians chase the golden calf as much as any people .</s>

<s>many of them , moreover , are beginning to complain about the scarcity of Western amusements and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant , the mullah , and the peasant .</s>

<s>nonetheless , they take time out -- much time -- from the game of grab and these new Western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks .</s>

<s>above all , they will stop in the middle of anything , anywhere , to hear or quote some poetry .</s>

<s>poetry in Persian life is far more than a common ground on which -- in a society deeply fissured by antagonisms -- all may stand .</s>

<s>it contains , in fact , their whole outlook on life .</s>

<s>and it is expressed , at least to their taste , in a perfect form .</s>

<s>poetry for a Persian is nothing less than truth and beauty .</s>

<s>in most Western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the libraries and museums .</s>

<s>in Persia , where practically speaking there are no museums or libraries or , for that matter , hardly any books , the twins run free .</s>

<s>it is perhaps difficult to conceive , but imagine that tonight on London bridge the Teddy boys of the East End will gather to sing Marlowe , Herrick , Shakespeare , and perhaps some lyrics of their own .</s>

<s>that , at any rate , is what happens at the Khaju bridge .</s>

<s>boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade .</s>

<s>here in these little rooms -- or stages arched open to the sky and river -- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which Persian music is divided .</s>

<s>each mode is believed to have a specific attribute -- one inducing pleasure , another generosity , another love , and so on , to include all of the emotions .</s>

<s>the singer simply matches the poem to a mode ;
for example , the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem : they brought me news that Spring is in the plains and Ahmad's blood the crimson tulip stains ;
go , tell his aged mother that her son Fought with a thousand foes , and he was one .</s>

<s>or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet : know ye , fair folk who dwell on earth or shall hereafter come to birth , that here , with dust upon his eyes , Iraj , the sweet-tongued singer , lies .</s>

<s>in this true lover's tomb interred a world of love lies sepulchred .</s>

<s>these songs ( practically all Persian music , for that matter ) are limited to a range of two octaves .</s>

<s>yet within this limitation there is an astonishing variety : design as intricate as that in the carpet or miniature , with the melodic line like the painted or woven line often flowing into an arabesque .</s>

<s>die Frist ist um , und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben Jahr , the Maestro quoted The Flying Dutchman , as he told of his career and wanderings , explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred in his life several times .</s>

<s>the music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra , William Steinberg , has molded his group into a prominent musical organization , which is his life .</s>

<s>when he added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1958 , he conducted one hundred fifty concerts within nine months , commuting between the two cities .</s>

<s>this schedule became too strenuous , even for the energetic and conscientious Mr. Steinberg .</s>

<s>his London contract was rescinded , and now , he explains cheerfully , as a bright smile lightens his intense , mobile face , I conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts ]
our meeting took place in May , 1961 , during one of the Maestro's stop-overs in New York , before he left for Europe .</s>

<s>as we began to converse in the lounge of his Fifth Avenue hotel , his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent .</s>

<s>seeking an obscure , dark , relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise suffused with afternoon sunshine , he asked if the soft background music could be turned off .</s>

<s>unfortunately , it was Muzak , which automatically is piped into the public rooms , and which nolens volens had to be endured .</s>

<s>as he talked about himself , time and again stuffing and dragging on his pipe , Steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried feeling grew faint and was dispelled .</s>

<s>did he come from a musical family ?</s>

<s>yes : though not professional musicians , they were a music-loving family .</s>

<s>in his native Cologne , where his mother taught him to play the piano , he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet .</s>

<s>she even devised a system of colors , whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values .</s>

<s>when he started school at the age of five-and-a-half , he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter A , instead of C , as in the scale .</s>

<s>because , like many other children , he intensely disliked practicing Czerny Etudes , he composed his own studies .</s>

<s>when he was eight he began violin lessons .</s>

<s>soon he was playing in the Cologne Municipal Orchestra , and during World War 1 , when musicians were scarce , he joined the opera orchestra as well .</s>

<s>Steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career .</s>

<s>by observing the conductor , he says with a twinkle in his eyes , I learned how not to conduct .</s>

<s>the musician ran away from school when he was fifteen , but this escapade did not save him from the Gymnasium .</s>

<s>simultaneously , he pursued his musical studies at the conservatory , receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony , as well in the violin and piano .</s>

<s>his professional career began when he was twenty ;
he became Otto Klemperer's personal assistant at the Cologne Opera , and a year later was promoted to the position of regular conductor .</s>

<s>wasn't this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post ?</s>

<s>yes , the Maestro assented .</s>

<s>had he always wished to be a conductor ?</s>

<s>no , originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such .</s>

<s>however , when he assumed the duties of a conductor , he relinquished his career as a pianist .</s>

<s>five years were spent with the Cologne Opera , after which he was called to Prague by Alexander von Zemlinsky , teacher of Arnold Schonberg and Erich Korngold .</s>

<s>in 1927 he succeeded Zemlinsky as opera director of the German Theater at Prague .</s>

<s>during his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the Berlin State Opera .</s>

<s>two years later he became director of the Frankfurt Opera , where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the rise of the Hitler regime .</s>

<s>during these years the youthful conductor had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in Germany .</s>

<s>he had presented the first German performances of Puccini's Manon Lescaut and De Falla's La Vida Breve .</s>

<s>the Frankfurt years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of Berg's Wozzek soon after the Berlin premiere under Erich Kleiber , and the world premiere of Schonberg's Von heute auf morgen .</s>

<s>at the outset of his career , Steinberg had dedicated himself to the advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a Schonberg work every year .</s>

<s>in Frankfurt , too , he directed the Museum and Opera House concerts which , in addition to the standard repertoire , featured novelties like Erdmann's Piano Concerto and Mahler's Sixth Symphony .</s>

<s>because of the political upheaval in Germany in the 1930's , Steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the Jewish community .</s>

<s>through the Frankfurt Jewish Kulturbund he began to give sonata recitals in synagogues , with Cellist Emanuel Feuermann .</s>

<s>as more and more Jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt Kulturbund Orchestra , which also gave guest performances in other German cities .</s>

<s>in 1936 he accepted the leadership of the Berlin Kulturbund .</s>

<s>in the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt Kulturbund orchestras joined under the combined efforts of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine Orchestra -- now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra -- with Steinberg as founder-conductor .</s>

<s>in 1938 , at the insistence of Arturo Toscanini , Steinberg left Germany for the United States , by way of Switzerland .</s>

<s>after he had spent the first three years in New York as associate conductor , at Toscanini's invitation , of the J Orchestra , he made numerous guest appearances throughout the United States and Latin America .</s>

<s>in 1945 he became conductor of the Buffalo Philharmonic .</s>

<s>seven years later he was asked to become director of the Pittsburgh Symphony .</s>

<s>since 1944 he has also conducted regularly at the San Francisco Opera , where he made his debut with a memorable performance of Verdi's Falstaff .</s>

<s>in recent years he has traveled widely in Europe , conducting in Italy , France , Austria , and Switzerland .</s>

<s>he returned to Germany for the first time in 1953 , where he has since conducted in Cologne , Frankfurt , and Berlin .</s>

<s>where in Europe was he going now ?</s>

<s>first of all , to Italy for a short vacation -- Forte Dei Marmi , a place he loves .</s>

<s>since it is not far from Viareggio , he will visit Puccini's house , as he never fails to do , to pay his respects to the memory of the composer of La Boheme , which he considers one of Puccini's masterpieces .</s>

<s>Steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about Italy : Rome is my second home .</s>

<s>I consider it the center of the world and make it a point to be there once a year .</s>

<s>he will conduct two concerts at the Accademia Di Santa Cecilia , as well as concerts in Munich and Cologne .</s>

<s>then I return to the United States for engagements at the Hollywood Bowl and in Philadelphia , he added .</s>

<s>the forthcoming season in Pittsburgh also promises to be of unusual interest .</s>

<s>there will be premieres of new works , made possible through Ford Foundation commissions : Carlisle Floyd's Mystery , with Phyllis Curtin as soprano soloist .</s>

<s>other world premieres will be Gardner Read's Third Symphony and Burle Marx's Samba Concertante .</s>

<s>and next year we will do -- also a Ford commission -- a piano concerto by Elliott Carter , with Jacob Lateiner as soloist .</s>

<s>of course , I shall conduct Mahler and Bruckner works in the coming season , as usual .</s>

<s>we'll play Bruckner's Fifth Symphony in the original version , and Mahler's Seventh -- the least accessible , known , and played of Mahler's works .</s>

<s>my Pittsburghers have become real addicts to Mahler and Bruckner .</s>

<s>he added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters on tour , especially Mahler's First and Fourth symphonies , and Das Lied Von der Erde , and Bruckner's Sixth -- which is rarely played -- and Seventh .</s>

<s>Bruckner's Eighth he refers to as my travel symphony .</s>

<s>he recalled that in California after a critic had attacked him for still trying to sell Bruckner to the Americans , the public's response at the next concert was a standing ovation .</s>

<s>now that Bruno Walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend Dimitri Mitropoulos is no longer with us , I am probably the only one -- with the possible exception of Leonard Bernstein -- who has this special affinity for and champions the works of Bruckner and Mahler .</s>

<s>since he introduces so much modern music , I could not resist asking how he felt about it .</s>

<s>there was always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in which it was created .</s>

<s>but I usually stick to the old phrase : ich habe ein Amt , aber keine Meinung ( I hold an office , but I do not feel entitled to have an opinion ) .</s>

<s>I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today .</s>

<s>with all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ?</s>

<s>he had just paid a brief visit to the Frick Collection to admire his favorite paintings by Rembrandt and Franz Hals .</s>

<s>he was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired Claude Lorrain , but reminisced with pleasure over a Poussin exhibit he had been able to see in Paris a year ago .</s>

<s>and how did he feel about modern art ?</s>

<s>again Steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments .</s>

<s>as my wife puts it , he said , again with a twinkle in his eyes , all you know is your music .</s>

<s>but after all , you never learned anything else ]
what did he do for relaxation ?</s>

<s>like his late colleague , Mitropoulos , he reads mystery stories , in particular Sir Arthur Conan Doyle .</s>

<s>he cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature .</s>

<s>but his prime interest , apart from music , he insisted seriously , was his family -- his wife , daughter and son .</s>

<s>at the moment he was excited about his son's having received the Prix De Rome in archaeology and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation of an Etruscan tomb .</s>

<s>both children are musical and my wife is a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgement .</s>

<s>is the attitude of German youth comparable to that of the angry young men of England ?</s>

<s>was the topic for a round-table discussion at the Bayerische Rundfunk in Munich .</s>

<s>I was chairman , the only not youthful participant .</s>

<s>since attack serves to stimulate interest in broadcasts , I added to my opening statement a sentence in which I claimed that German youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which is a necessary ingredient of anger , and might be classified as uninterested and bored rather than angry .</s>

<s>I was far from convinced of the truth of my statement , but could not think of anything that might evoke responses more quickly .</s>

<s>it is easy for you to talk ;
countered a twenty year old law student , you travel around the world .</s>

<s>we would like to do that too .</s>

<s>but you want a job guaranteed when you return , I continued my attack .</s>

<s>you must have some security , said a young clerk .</s>

<s>when I mentioned that for my first long voyage I did not even have the money for the return fare , but had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient amount , the young people looked at me doubtingly .</s>

<s>one girl expressed what was obviously in their minds .</s>

<s>would you advise us to act the same way ?</s>

<s>you might have failed .</s>

<s>I think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck .</s>

<s>others mentioned that I might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding .</s>

<s>the debate needed no additional controversy and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life , what his hopes were and what his fears .</s>

<s>though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of age , the oldest twenty-four , came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them .</s>

<s>what they wished for most was security ;
what they feared most was war or political instability in their own country .</s>

<s>the ideal home , they agreed , would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms , just enough for a family consisting of husband , wife , and two children .</s>

<s>no one wanted a larger family or no children , and none hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory .</s>

<s>all expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest .</s>

<s>once again , as in the days of the Founding Fathers , America faces a stern test .</s>

<s>that test , as President Kennedy forthrightly depicted it in his State of the Union message , will determine whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure .</s>

<s>it is well then that in this hour both of national peril and of national opportunity we can take counsel with the men who made the nation .</s>

<s>incapable of self-delusion , the Founding Fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave , and yet they had confidence that America would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty .</s>

<s>seven Founders -- George Washington , Benjamin Franklin , John Adams , Thomas Jefferson , Alexander Hamilton , James Madison and John Jay -- determined the destinies of the new nation .</s>

<s>in certain respects , their task was incomparably greater than ours today , for there was nobody before them to show them the way .</s>

<s>as Madison commented to Jefferson in 1789 , we are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us .</s>

<s>our successors will have an easier task .</s>

<s>they thought of themselves , to use Jefferson's words , as the Argonauts who had lived in the Heroic Age .</s>

<s>accordingly , they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity .</s>

<s>their writings assume more than dramatic or patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but , rather , as Washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen , that with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved .</s>

<s>strong men with strong opinions , frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet , the Founding Seven were essentially congenial minds , and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences .</s>

<s>even though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off , enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation .</s>

<s>before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary .</s>

<s>certainly no other seven American statesmen from any later period achieved so much in so concentrated a span of years .</s>

<s>eldest of the seven , Benjamin Franklin , a New Englander transplanted to Philadelphia , wrote the most dazzling success story in our history .</s>

<s>the young printer's apprentice achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields , as editor and publisher , scientist , inventor , philanthropist and statesman .</s>

<s>author of the Albany Plan Of Union , which , had it been adopted , might have avoided the Revolution , he fought the colonists' front-line battles in London , negotiated the treaty of alliance with France and the peace that ended the war , headed the state government of Pennsylvania , and exercised an important moderating influence at the Federal Convention .</s>

<s>on a military mission for his native Virginia the youthful George Washington touched off the French and Indian War , then guarded his colony's frontier as head of its militia .</s>

<s>commanding the Continental Army for six long years of the Revolution , he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory .</s>

<s>retiring to his beloved Mount Vernon , he returned to preside over the Federal Convention , and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected President .</s>

<s>during his two terms the Constitution was tested and found workable , strong national policies were inaugurated , and the traditions and powers of the Presidential office firmly fixed .</s>

<s>John Adams fashioned much of pre-Revolutionary radical ideology , wrote the constitution of his home state of Massachusetts , negotiated , with Franklin and Jay , the peace with Britain and served as our first Vice President and our second President .</s>

<s>his political opponent and lifetime friend , Thomas Jefferson , achieved immortality through his authorship of the Declaration of Independence , but equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted in his native Virginia , his role as father of our territorial system , and his acquisition of the Louisiana Territory during his first term as President .</s>

<s>during the greater part of Jefferson's career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow Virginian , James Madison , eight years his junior .</s>

<s>the active sponsor of Jefferson's measure for religious liberty in Virginia , Madison played the most influential single role in the drafting of the Constitution and in securing its ratification in Virginia , founded the first political party in American history , and , as Jefferson's Secretary of State and his successor in the Presidency , guided the nation through the troubled years of our second war with Britain .</s>

<s>if Franklin was an authentic genius , then Alexander Hamilton , with his exceptional precocity , consuming energy , and high ambition , was a political prodigy .</s>

<s>his revolutionary pamphlets , published when he was only 19 , quickly brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders .</s>

<s>principal author of The Federalist , he swung New York over from opposition to the Constitution to ratification almost single-handedly .</s>

<s>his collaboration with Washington , begun when he was the general's aide during the Revolution , was resumed when he entered the first Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury .</s>

<s>his bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the Constitution stand as durable contributions .</s>

<s>less dazzling than Hamilton , less eloquent than Jefferson , John Jay commands an equally high rank among the Founding Fathers .</s>

<s>he served as president of the Continental Congress .</s>

<s>he played the leading role in negotiating the treaty with Great Britain that ended the Revolution , and directed America's foreign affairs throughout the Confederation period .</s>

<s>as first Chief Justice , his strong nationalist opinions anticipated John Marshall .</s>

<s>he ended his public career as a two-term governor of New York .</s>

<s>these Seven Founders constituted an intellectual and social elite , the most respectable and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed .</s>

<s>their social status was achieved in some cases by birth , as with Washington , Jefferson and Jay ;
in others by business and professional acumen , as with Franklin and Adams , or , in Hamilton's case , by an influential marriage .</s>

<s>unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals in underdeveloped nations of our own day , they commanded both prestige and influence before the Revolution started .</s>

<s>as different physically as the tall , angular Jefferson was from the chubby , rotund Adams , the seven were striking individualists .</s>

<s>ardent , opinionated , even obstinate , they were amazingly articulate , wrote their own copy , and were masters of phrasemaking .</s>

<s>capable of enduring friendships , they were also stout controversialists , who could write with a drop of vitriol on their pens .</s>

<s>John Adams dismissed John Dickinson , who voted against the Declaration of Independence , as a certain great fortune and piddling genius .</s>

<s>Washington castigated his critic , General Conway , as being capable of all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity .</s>

<s>and Hamilton , who felt it a religious duty to oppose Aaron Burr's political ambitions , would have been a better actuarial risk had he shown more literary restraint .</s>

<s>the Seven Founders were completely dedicated to the public service .</s>

<s>Madison once remarked : my life has been so much a public one , a comment which fits the careers of the other six .</s>

<s>Franklin retired from editing and publishing at the age of 42 , and for the next forty-two years devoted himself to public , scientific , and philanthropic interests .</s>

<s>Washington never had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved best , plantation management .</s>

<s>he served as Commander in Chief during the Revolution without compensation .</s>

<s>John Adams took to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor , Jeremiah Gridley , to pursue the study of the law , rather than the gain of it .</s>

<s>in taking account of seventeen years of law practice , Adams concluded that no lawyer in America ever did so much business as I did and for so little profit .</s>

<s>when the Revolution broke out , he , along with Jefferson and Jay , abandoned his career at the bar , with considerable financial sacrifice .</s>

<s>Hamilton , poorest of the seven , gave up a brilliant law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet .</s>

<s>while he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the Government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends .</s>

<s>if you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars , he wrote one friend in 1791 when he was Secretary of the Treasury .</s>

<s>to support his large family Hamilton went back to the law after each spell of public service .</s>

<s>Talleyrand passed his New York law office one night on the way to a party .</s>

<s>Hamilton was bent over his desk , drafting a legal paper by the light of a candle .</s>

<s>the Frenchman was astonished .</s>

<s>I have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune of his country , but now is working all night in order to support his family , he reflected .</s>

<s>all seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality .</s>

<s>John Adams asserted in the Continental Congress' Declaration of Rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters , the British Constitution and the common law , and Jefferson appealed in the Declaration of Independence to the tribunal of the world for support of a revolution justified by the laws of nature and of nature's God .</s>

<s>they fought hard , but they were forgiving to former foes , and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of 1783 .</s>

<s>this sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified in an exchange of letters between John Jay and a Tory refugee , Peter Van Schaack .</s>

<s>Jay had participated in the decision that exiled his old friend Van Schaack .</s>

<s>yet when , at war's end , the ex-Tory made the first move to resume correspondence , Jay wrote him from Paris , where he was negotiating the peace settlement : as an independent American I considered all who were not for us , and you amongst the rest , as against us , yet be assured that John Jay never ceased to be the friend of Peter Van Schaack .</s>

<s>the latter in turn assured him that were I arraigned at the bar , and you my judge , I should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause .</s>

<s>all seven recognized that independence was but the first step toward building a nation .</s>

<s>we have now a national character to establish , Washington wrote in 1783 .</s>

<s>think continentally , Hamilton counseled the young nation .</s>

<s>this new force , love of country , super-imposed upon -- if not displacing -- affectionate ties to one's own state , was epitomized by Washington .</s>

<s>his first inaugural address speaks of my country whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love .</s>

<s>all sought the fruition of that nationalism in a Federal Government with substantial powers .</s>

<s>save Jefferson , all participated in the framing or ratification of the Federal Constitution .</s>

<s>they supported it , not as a perfect instrument , but as the best obtainable .</s>

<s>historians have traditionally regarded the great debates of the Seventeen Nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized vs. limited government , with Hamilton and the nationalists supporting the former and Jefferson and Madison upholding the latter position .</s>

<s>the state's rights position was formulated by Jefferson and Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves , but in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better Hamiltonians than Jeffersonians .</s>

<s>in purchasing Louisiana , Jefferson had to adopt Hamilton's broad construction of the Constitution , and so did Madison in advocating the rechartering of Hamilton's bank , which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception , and in adopting a Hamiltonian protective tariff .</s>

<s>indeed , the old Jeffersonians were far more atune to the Hamilton-oriented Whigs than they were to the Jacksonian Democrats .</s>

<s>when , in 1832 , the South Carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition which Madison had advanced in his old Virginia Resolve , they elicited no encouragement from that senior statesman .</s>

<s>in his political testament , Advice To My Country , penned just before his death , Madison expressed the wish that the Union of the States be cherished and perpetuated .</s>

<s>let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora with her box opened ;
and the disguised one , as the serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into Paradise .</s>

<s>Tobacco Road is dead .</s>

<s>long live Tobacco Road .</s>

<s>nostalgic Yankee readers of Erskine Caldwell are today informed by proud Georgians that Tobacco Road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway , over which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the Dow-Jones average than with the cotton crop .</s>

<s>thus we are compelled to face the urbanization of the South -- an urbanization which , despite its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the Southern culture , has been utterly ignored by the bulk of Southern writers .</s>

<s>indeed , it seems that only in today's Southern fiction does Tobacco Road , with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint juleps , continue to live -- but only as a weary , overexploited phantom .</s>

<s>those writers known collectively as the Southern school have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize ;
according to many critics , in fact , the South has led the North in literature since the Civil War , both quantitatively and qualitatively .</s>

<s>such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum renaissance .</s>

<s>it is interesting , however , that despite this strong upsurge in Southern writing , almost none of the writers has forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the season's cotton and tobacco crops ;
of the stereotyped Negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields ;
of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps of the past century .</s>

<s>this is not to say that the South is no longer agrarian ;
such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification .</s>

<s>but the South is , and has been for the past century , engaged in a wide-sweeping urbanization which , oddly enough , is not reflected in its literature .</s>

<s>in 1900 the South was only 15% urban ;
in 1950 it had become 47.1% urban .</s>

<s>in a mere half-century the South has more than tripled its urban status .</s>

<s>there is a New South emerging , a South losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with the rapidity of an avalanche -- especially within recent decades .</s>

<s>as the New South snowballs toward further urbanization , it becomes more and more homogeneous with the North -- a tendency which Willard Thorp terms Yankeefication , as evidenced in such cities as Charlotte , Birmingham , and Houston .</s>

<s>it is said that , even at the present stage of Southern urbanization , such a city as Atlanta is not distinctly unlike Columbus or Trenton .</s>

<s>undoubtedly even the old Southern stalwart Richmond has felt the new wind : William Styron mentions in his latest novel an avenue named for Bankhead McGruder , a Civil War general , now renamed , in typical California fashion , Buena Vista Terrace .</s>

<s>the effects of television and other mass media are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force .</s>

<s>as for progress , the backward South can boast of Baton Rouge , which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and sixty-two percent , to 126,000 , the second largest growth of the period for all cities over 25,000 .</s>

<s>the field , then , is ripe for new Southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century phenomenon , the Southern Yankeefication : the new urban economy , the city-dweller , the pains of transition , the labor problems ;
the list is , obviously , endless .</s>

<s>but these sources have not been tapped .</s>

<s>Truman Capote is still reveling in Southern Gothicism , exaggerating the old Southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque , but as unreal as -- or even more unreal than -- yesterday .</s>

<s>William Styron , while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance , insists he is not to be classified as a Southern writer and yet includes traditional Southern concepts in everything he publishes .</s>

<s>even the great god Faulkner , the South's one probable contender for literary immortality , has little concerned himself with these matters ;
such are simply not within his bounded province .</s>

<s>where are the writers to treat these changes ?</s>

<s>has the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded or unwanted ?</s>

<s>perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated testings over the decades .</s>

<s>lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy , these writers seem to be contenting themselves with an old one that is now as defunct as Confederate money .</s>

<s>an example of the changes which have crept over the Southern region may be seen in the Southern Negro's quest for a position in the white-dominated society , a problem that has been reflected in regional fiction especially since 1865 .</s>

<s>today the Negro must discover his role in an industrialized South , which indicates that the racial aspect of the Southern dilemma hasn't changed radically , but rather has gradually come to be reflected in this new context , this new coat of paint .</s>

<s>the Negro faces as much , if not more , difficulty in fitting himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one .</s>

<s>this represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem .</s>

<s>but there have been abrupt changes as well : the sit-ins , the picket lines , the bus strikes -- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago .</s>

<s>today's evidence , such as the fact that only three Southern states ( South Carolina , Alabama and Mississippi ) still openly defy integration , would have astounded many of yesterday's Southerners into speechlessness .</s>

<s>other examples of gradual changes that have affected the Negro have been his moving up , row by row , in the buses ;
his requesting , and often getting , higher wages , better working conditions , better schools -- changes that were slowly emerging even before the Supreme Court decision of 1954 .</s>

<s>then came this decision , which sped the process of gaining equality ( or perhaps hindered it ;
only historical evolution will determine which ) : an abrupt change .</s>

<s>since 1954 the Negro's desire for social justice has led to an ironically anarchical rebellion .</s>

<s>he has frequently refused to move from white lunch counters , refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust , while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws .</s>

<s>this bold self-assertion , after decades of humble subservience , is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon , an abrupt change in the Southern way of existence .</s>

<s>a new order is thrusting itself into being .</s>

<s>a new South is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation , uncertainty , and lack of action from the Negro in defining his new role in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white man .</s>

<s>the modern Negro has not made a decisive debut into Southern fiction .</s>

<s>it is clear that , while most writers enjoy picturing the Negro as a woolly-headed , humble old agrarian who mutters yassuhs and sho' nufs with blissful deference to his white employer ( or , in Old South terms , massuh ) , this stereotype is doomed to become in reality as obsolete as Caldwell's Lester .</s>

<s>while there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps scattered through the rural South , such men appear to be a vanishing breed .</s>

<s>writers openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white man ;
but they obviously mean by this , not a Negro personality , but a Negro type .</s>

<s>presenting an individualized Negro character , it would seem , is one of the most difficult assignments a Southern writer could tackle ;
and the success of such an endeavor is , as suggested above , glaringly rare .</s>

<s>just as the Negro situation points up the gradual and abrupt changes affecting Southern life , it also points up the non-representation of urbanism in Southern literature .</s>

<s>the book concerned with the Negro's role in an urban society is rare indeed ;
recently only Keith Wheeler's novel , Peaceable Lane , has openly faced the problem .</s>

<s>all but the most rabid of Confederate flag wavers admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life .</s>

<s>many earlier writers , mourning the demise of the old order , tended to romanticize and exaggerate this gracious Old South imagery , creating such lasting impressions as Margaret Mitchell's Tara Plantation .</s>

<s>modern writers , who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects , insist upon drawing out this legend , prolonging its burial , when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century .</s>

<s>perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing ;
but they can hardly deny that , exaggerated or not , the old panorama is dead .</s>

<s>as John T. Westbrook says in his article , Twilight Of Southern Regionalism ( Southwest Review , Winter 1957 ) : the miasmal mausoleum where an Old South , already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry , should be left to rest in peace , forever dead and ( let us fervently hope ) forever done with .</s>

<s>Westbrook further bemoans the Southern writers' creation of an unreal image of their homeland , which is too readily assimilated by both foreign readers and visiting Yankees : our northerner is suspicious of all this crass evidence ( of urbanization ) presented to his senses .</s>

<s>it bewilders and befuddles him .</s>

<s>he is too deeply steeped in William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren .</s>

<s>the fumes of progress are in his nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes , but his heart is away in Yoknapatawpha County with razorback hogs and night riders .</s>

<s>on this trip to the South he wants , above all else , to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight .</s>

<s>obviously , such a Northern tourist's purpose is somewhat akin to a child's experience with Disneyland : he wants to see a world of make-believe .</s>

<s>in the meantime , while the South has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization that is so disappointing to the curious Yankee , Southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region's progress .</s>

<s>Willard Thorp , in his new book , American Writing In The Twentieth Century , observes , quite validly it seems : certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched .</s>

<s>no Southern novelist has done for Atlanta or Birmingham what Herrick , Dreiser , and Farrell did for Chicago or Dos Passos did for New York .</s>

<s>there are almost no fictional treatments of the industrialized south .</s>

<s>not a single Southern author , major or minor , has made the urban problems of an urban South his primary source material .</s>

<s>Faulkner , for one , appears to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in this regard .</s>

<s>Faulkner culminates the Southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been , or could ever be , done .</s>

<s>he has made it his , and his it remains , irrevocably .</s>

<s>he treats it with a mythological , universal application .</s>

<s>as his disciples boast , even though his emphasis is elsewhere , Faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the South quite keenly , as can be proven by a quick recalling of his Sartoris and Snopes families .</s>

<s>even two decades ago in Go Down , Moses Faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the South might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil .</s>

<s>yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact .</s>

<s>Faulkner traces , in his vast and overpowering saga of Yoknapatawpha County , the gradual changes which seep into the South , building layer upon layer of minute , subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the Old Way .</s>

<s>thus Faulkner reminds us , and wisely , that the new South has gradually evolved out of the Old South , and consequently its agrarian roots persist .</s>

<s>yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if not himself : the problems with which a New South must grapple in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization .</s>

<s>with new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of six men : a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil .</s>

<s>the thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with even greater stress and tension : the sacred wilderness is gradually surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas .</s>

<s>another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre .</s>

<s>most avant-garde creators , true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement , have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting .</s>

<s>but Robert Rauschenberg , the neo-dadaist artist , has collaborated with several of them .</s>

<s>he has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for Mr. Cunningham's Summerspace , so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity .</s>

<s>for Mr. Taylor's Images And Reflections she made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer , and a girl's cape lined with grass .</s>

<s>Mr. Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor .</s>

<s>in fact , he calls his productions dance-theatre works of motion , shape , light , and sound .</s>

<s>to raise the dancer out of his personal , pedestrian self , Mr. Nikolais has experimented with relating him to a larger , environmental orbit .</s>

<s>he began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be .</s>

<s>he went on to use objects -- hoops , poles , capes -- which he employed as extensions of the body of the dancer , who moved with them .</s>

<s>the depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure .</s>

<s>in each case , the object , the color , even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer .</s>

<s>the dancer who never loosens her hold on a parasol , begins to feel that it is part of herself .</s>

<s>or , clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of hoops , the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a finial .</s>

<s>as the dancer is depersonalized , his accouterments are animized , and the combined elements give birth to a new being .</s>

<s>from this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit .</s>

<s>thus , the avant-garde choreographers have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition .</s>

<s>but , since they have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity , how are they to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal ?</s>

<s>some look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work .</s>

<s>others , less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times , experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet , painter , and musician .</s>

<s>an approach that has appealed to some choreographers is reminiscent of Charles Olson's statement of the process of projective verse : one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception .</s>

<s>the creator trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors the reality of his experience .</s>

<s>he disdains external restrictions -- conventional syntax , traditional metre .</s>

<s>the unit of form is determined subjectively : the Heart , by the way of the Breath , to the Line .</s>

<s>the test of form is fidelity to the experience , a gauge also accepted by the abstract expressionist painters .</s>

<s>an earlier but still influential school of painting , surrealism , had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience , that event in which seemingly incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations of the subconscious .</s>

<s>the resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions , but it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order .</s>

<s>the contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines , colors , masses , and energies .</s>

<s>he is still concerned , however , with a personal event .</s>

<s>he accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation .</s>

<s>the work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience .</s>

<s>some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment , with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities , than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher , more serene level of truth .</s>

<s>rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design , which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world .</s>

<s>the concept remains subjective .</s>

<s>but in this approach it is the artist's ultimate insight , rather than his immediate impressions , that gives form to the work .</s>

<s>others look to more objective devices of order .</s>

<s>the musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes a mathematical system of rotations that , once set in motion , determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities .</s>

<s>the composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of intervals ( or rhythms or dynamic changes ) .</s>

<s>he may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers .</s>

<s>but he cannot order his elements by will , either rational or inspired .</s>

<s>the system works as an impersonal mechanism .</s>

<s>musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development .</s>

<s>again , the composer must select his own materials .</s>

<s>but a tossing of coins , with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the oracles of the I Ching , the Chinese Book Of Changes , dictates the handling of the chosen materials .</s>

<s>avant-garde choreographers , seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements , have turned to similar approaches .</s>

<s>some let dances take their form from the experience of creation .</s>

<s>according to Katherine Litz , the becoming , the process of realization , is the dance .</s>

<s>the process stipulates that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it .</s>

<s>the sequence may involve a sharp contrast : for example , a quiet meditative sway of the body succeeded by a violent leap ;
or it may involve more subtle distinctions : the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged , its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified , or it may be transferred to become a movement of only the arms or the head .</s>

<s>even the least alteration will change the quality .</s>

<s>an exploration of these possible relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance .</s>

<s>the approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic , as it is for Miss Litz , or spontaneous , as it is for Merle Marsicano .</s>

<s>she , too , is concerned with the becoming , the process of realization , but she does not think in terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns .</s>

<s>the design is determined emotionally : I must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confronts me .</s>

<s>looking back , Miss Marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock .</s>

<s>at one time she felt impelled to make dances that moved all over the stage , much as Pollock's paintings move violently over the full extent of the canvas .</s>

<s>but her conscious need was to break away from constricting patterns of form , a need to let the experience shape itself .</s>

<s>Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement .</s>

<s>it may be a free front-back swing of the leg , leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground .</s>

<s>this became a dance called Prelude To Flight .</s>

<s>a pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus .</s>

<s>Alwin Nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal emotion .</s>

<s>he seeks to make his dancers more godlike by relating them to the impersonal elements of shape , light , color , and sound .</s>

<s>if his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures from Mars , this is consistent with his intention of placing them in the orbit of another world , a world in which they are freed of their pedestrian identities .</s>

<s>it is through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ of form is discovered .</s>

<s>in his recognition of his impersonal self the dancer moves , and this self , in the first revealed stroke of its existence , states the theme from which all else must follow .</s>

<s>the theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve .</s>

<s>it may be a reaction to a percussive sound , the following movements constituting further reactions .</s>

<s>it may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color , in which case changes in the light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs .</s>

<s>unconcerned with the practical function of his actions , the dancer is engrossed exclusively in their motional content .</s>

<s>movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive .</s>

<s>but the metamorphosis must come first .</s>

<s>though he is also concerned with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity , Merce Cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim .</s>

<s>he rejects all subjectively motivated continuity , any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect .</s>

<s>he bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything .</s>

<s>an order can be chanced rather than chosen , and this approach produces an experience that is free and discovered rather than bound and remembered .</s>

<s>thus , there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well .</s>

<s>chance , he finds , enables him to create a world beyond imagination .</s>

<s>he cites with pleasure the comment of a lady , who exclaimed after a concert : why , it's extremely interesting .</s>

<s>but I would never have thought of it myself .</s>

<s>the sequence of movements in a Cunningham dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life .</s>

<s>at one side of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly ;
nearby , another sits motionless , while still another is twirling an umbrella .</s>

<s>a man and a girl happen to meet ;
they look straight at the audience , not at each other .</s>

<s>he lifts her , puts her down , and walks off , neither pleased nor disturbed , as if nothing had happened .</s>

<s>if one dancer slaps another , the victim may do a pirouette , sit down , or offer his assailant a fork and spoon .</s>

<s>events occur without apparent reason .</s>

<s>their consequences are irrelevant -- or there are no consequences at all .</s>

<s>the sequence is determined by chance , and Mr. Cunningham makes use of any one of several chance devices .</s>

<s>he may toss coins ;
he may take slips of paper from a grab bag .</s>

<s>the answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal organization of the dance but also its spatial design , special slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be performed .</s>

<s>the other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance .</s>

<s>the only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the movements themselves , the number of the dancers , and the approximate total duration of the dance .</s>

<s>the approximate is important , because even after the order of the work has been established by the chance method , the result is not inviolable .</s>

<s>each performance may be different .</s>

<s>if a work is divided into several large segments , a last-minute drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for any particular performance .</s>

<s>and any sequence can not only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether .</s>

<s>Mr. Cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method ;
he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can .</s>

<s>however , there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute .</s>

<s>then the choreographer must arbitrate .</s>

<s>he must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other .</s>

<s>he must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap .</s>

<s>the North and the South were in greater agreement on sovereignty , through all their dispute about it , than were the Founding Fathers .</s>

<s>the truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun , and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee .</s>

<s>the people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles , in understanding of and belief in the federal balance , and in love of their Union .</s>

<s>repeated efforts -- beginning with the Missouri Compromise of 1821 -- were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise , rather than clear thought and timely action .</s>

<s>even so , confusion in this period gained such strength ( from compromise and other factors ) that it led to the bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century .</s>

<s>nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty .</s>

<s>the present issue in Atlantica -- whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens -- resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather than the one that was resolved by Civil War .</s>

<s>and so I would only touch upon it now ( much as I have long wanted to write a book about it ) .</s>

<s>I think it is essential , however , to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that went to war in 1861 -- if only to see better how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject .</s>

<s>the difference came down to this : the Southern States insisted that the United States was , in last analysis , what its name implied -- a Union of States .</s>

<s>to their leaders the Constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign states , who therefore retained the right to secede from it .</s>

<s>this right of the State , its upholders contended , was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralizing power in the Union government .</s>

<s>the champions of the Union maintained that the Constitution had formed , fundamentally , the united people of America , that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather than states , and that therefore the states had no right to secede , though the citizens could .</s>

<s>writing to Speed on August 24 , 1855 , Lincoln made the latter point clear .</s>

<s>in homely terms whose timeliness is startling today , he thus declared his own right to secede .</s>

<s>we began by declaring that all men are created equal .</s>

<s>we now practically read it , all men are created equal except Negroes .</s>

<s>when the Know-nothings get control , it will read , all men are created equal except Negroes and foreigners and Catholics .</s>

<s>when it comes to this , I shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty -- to Russia , for instance , where despotism can be taken pure , without the base alloy of hypocrisy ( his emphasis ) .</s>

<s>when the Southern States exercised their right to secede , they formed what they officially styled The Confederate States of America .</s>

<s>dictionaries , as we have seen , still cite this government , along with the Articles of Confederation of 1781 , as an example of a confederacy .</s>

<s>the fact is that the Southern Confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as the Federal Constitution did .</s>

<s>the Confederate Constitution copied much of the Federal Constitution verbatim , and most of the rest in substance .</s>

<s>it operated on , by and for the people individually just as did the Federal Constitution .</s>

<s>it made substantially the same division of power between the central and state governments , and among the executive , legislative and judicial branches .</s>

<s>the difference between confederacy and federal union in 1861
many believe -- and understandably -- that the great difference between the Constitution of the Southern Confederacy and the Federal Constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede .</s>

<s>but though each of its members had asserted this right against the Union , the final Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11 -- nearly a month before hostilities began -- included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede .</s>

<s>its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their Constitution .</s>

<s>their President , Jefferson Davis , interpreted their Constitution to mean that it admits of no coerced association , but this remained so doubtful that there were frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the Constitution .</s>

<s>the Constitution of the Southern Confederation differed from that of the Federal Union only in two important respects : it openly , defiantly , recognized slavery -- an institution which the Southerners of 1787 , even though they continued it , found so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning the word in the Federal Constitution .</s>

<s>they recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest , and that to recognize it explicitly in their Constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in the Declaration of 1776 that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among them are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .</s>

<s>the other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the President of the Confederacy held office for six ( instead of four ) years , and was limited to one term .</s>

<s>these are not , however , differences in federal structure .</s>

<s>the only important differences from that standpoint , between the two Constitutions , lies in their Preambles .</s>

<s>the one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 expressed , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens .</s>

<s>here are the two Preambles : Federal Constitution , 1789
we the people of the United States , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defence , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America .</s>

<s>Confederate Constitution , 1861
we the people of the Confederate States , each state acting in its sovereign and independent character , in order to form a permanent federal government , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity -- invoking the favor and the guidance of Almighty God -- do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate States of America .</s>

<s>one is tempted to say that , on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles , the worst war of the Nineteenth century was fought .</s>

<s>but though the Southern States , when drafting a constitution to unite themselves , narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede , the fact remained that by seceding from the Union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states .</s>

<s>if the Union conceded this to them , the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede : this would destroy the federal balance between it and the states , and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their Union .</s>

<s>Lincoln saw that the act of secession made the issue for the Union a vital one : whether it was a Union of sovereign citizens that should continue to live , or an association of sovereign states that must fall prey either to anarchy or despotism .</s>

<s>much as he abhorred slavery , Lincoln was always willing to concede to each slave state the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it .</s>

<s>though his election was interpreted by many Southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the Union , Lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the Constitution gave the states .</s>

<s>after the war began , he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action even in the Border States that stayed with the Union .</s>

<s>he issued his Emancipation Proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the Union .</s>

<s>in his Message of December 2 , 1862 , he put his purpose and his policy in these words -- which I would call the Lincoln Law of Liberty-and-Union : in giving freedom to the slave , we assure freedom to the free .</s>

<s>what Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the Union .</s>

<s>he fought to the end to preserve it as a government of the people , by the people , for the people .</s>

<s>the truth on each side won in the civil war
the fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to keep many of their people more securely in slavery -- the antithesis of individual liberty -- made the conflict grimmer , and the greater .</s>

<s>out of this ordeal the citizen emerged , in the South as in the North , as America's true sovereign , in a new birth of freedom , as Lincoln promised .</s>

<s>but before this came about , 214,938 Americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states .</s>

<s>on their decisive battlefield Lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the brave men , living and dead , who fought here .</s>

<s>he understood that both sides were at fault , and he reached the height of saying so explicitly in his Second Inaugural .</s>

<s>to my knowledge , Lincoln remains the only Head of State and Commander-in-Chief who , while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt , proved man enough to say this publicly -- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error , and in all our error , some truth .</s>

<s>so great a man could not but understand , too , that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought , which their opponents see and attack , but the truth which the latter do not see -- any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend .</s>

<s>it is much less difficult now than in Lincoln's day to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives in the Civil War to maintain the balance between the powers they had delegated to the States and to their Union .</s>

<s>they differed in the balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen -- but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth : that individual life , liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two -- and on the limitation of sovereignty , in all its aspects , which this involves .</s>

<s>the 140,414 Americans who gave the last full measure of devotion to prevent disunion , preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers of anarchy , inherent in confederations , which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states , and to the liberties of their people .</s>

<s>but the fact that 70,524 other Americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served Liberty-and-Union in other essential ways .</s>

<s>its appeal from ballots to bullets at Fort Sumter ended by costing the Southerners their right to have slaves -- a right that was even less compatible with the sovereignty of man .</s>

<s>the very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method , war , led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for , since it forced Lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure .</s>

<s>there was a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another .</s>

<s>there was also a lesson , one that has served ever since to keep Americans , in their conflicts with one another , from turning from the ballot to the bullet .</s>

<s>yet though the Southern States lost the worst errors in their case , they did not lose the truth they fought for .</s>

<s>the lives so many of them gave , to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment by the Union on the powers reserved to their states have continued ever since to safeguard all Americans against freedom's other foe .</s>

<s>as cells coalesced into organisms , they built new unnatural and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties of the external world .</s>

<s>the useful suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments .</s>

<s>one wonders about its applicability to people .</s>

<s>will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ?</s>

<s>the answer is , of course , yes .</s>

<s>for the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people .</s>

<s>social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes .</s>

<s>but it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides .</s>

<s>we have ample light when the sun sets ;
the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ;
we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down ;
the range of our voice ignores distance .</s>

<s>at what stage are social sciences then ?</s>

<s>is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ?</s>

<s>there is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud .</s>

<s>and it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact .</s>

<s>political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man .</s>

<s>consitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world courts , and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples .</s>

<s>most of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it .</s>

<s>the most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme .</s>

<s>just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding .</s>

<s>we are desperately in the need of such invention , for man is still very much at the mercy of man .</s>

<s>in fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other .</s>

<s>3 I want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear .</s>

<s>there are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears .</s>

<s>Lucretius has remarked : the reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause , and these they attribute to the will of God .</s>

<s>perhaps things were even worse then .</s>

<s>it is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man .</s>

<s>we get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was .</s>

<s>we are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared comets .</s>

<s>the bombs are as harmless as an automobile in a garage .</s>

<s>we are worried about what people may do with them -- that some crazy fool may push the button .</s>

<s>I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears , but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand out quite clearly .</s>

<s>they are in general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual .</s>

<s>they include both individual fears and collective ones .</s>

<s>they arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group .</s>

<s>often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized .</s>

<s>yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act .</s>

<s>to say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition .</s>

<s>but a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating .</s>

<s>the frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize .</s>

<s>it is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice .</s>

<s>this and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions .</s>

<s>this understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls .</s>

<s>in fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers .</s>

<s>there is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision .</s>

<s>a meteor could fall on San Francisco .</s>

<s>solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought .</s>

<s>our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which , in this case , amounts to doing nothing .</s>

<s>yet we no longer feel uneasy .</s>

<s>this almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war .</s>

<s>we , in our country , think of war as an external threat which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing .</s>

<s>and yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave .</s>

<s>what elements of our behavior are decisive ?</s>

<s>our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ?</s>

<s>we have staved off a war and , since our behavior has involved all these elements , we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of it , since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective .</s>

<s>I think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city .</s>

<s>if an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even though he might not be able to act quickly enough .</s>

<s>with the group of boys it is different .</s>

<s>he does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side .</s>

<s>when confronted with a drunk or an insane person I have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others .</s>

<s>I believe that what I do has some effect on his actions and I have learned , in a way , to commune with drunks , but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics .</s>

<s>I am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose .</s>

<s>our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise .</s>

<s>we are forced , in our behavior towards others , to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements .</s>

<s>our collective policies , group and national , are similarly based on voodoo , but here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still engaged in determing them .</s>

<s>we use terms from our personal experience with individuals such as trust , cheat , and get tough .</s>

<s>we talk about national character in the same way that Copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles .</s>

<s>we perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect .</s>

<s>small wonder , then , that we fear .</s>

<s>the achievements which dispelled our fears of the cosmos took place three centuries ago .</s>

<s>what additional roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played ?</s>

<s>in the physical sciences , these achievements concern electricity , chemistry , and atomic physics .</s>

<s>in the life sciences , there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanisms of heredity , and in bio- and physiological chemistry .</s>

<s>the major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment .</s>

<s>in addition , our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed .</s>

<s>even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding is still lacking , but where some explanations are possible , as with lightning and weather and earthquakes , the appropriate kind of human action has been more adequately indicated .</s>

<s>apparently the population as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears .</s>

<s>how and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study .</s>

<s>in some areas , the progress is slower than in others .</s>

<s>in agriculture , for example , despite the advances in biology , elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster .</s>

<s>in child care , the opposite extreme prevails ;
procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory .</s>

<s>there are many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear .</s>

<s>much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared .</s>

<s>the persistent horror of having a malformed child has , I believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it .</s>

<s>in fact , the recent warnings about the use of J have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears .</s>

<s>in fact , insofar as science generates any fear , it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty .</s>

<s>perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease .</s>

<s>the situation with regard to our attitude and control of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect to people .</s>

<s>the fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear I have tried to describe .</s>

<s>nothing like Godot , he arrived before the hour .</s>

<s>his letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday , and I came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve .</s>

<s>he was waiting .</s>

<s>my wish to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work .</s>

<s>american newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic .</s>

<s>they find deep pessimism in them .</s>

<s>even so astute a commentator as Harold Clurman of The Nation has said that Waiting For Godot is the concentrate of the contemporary European mood of despair .</s>

<s>but to me Beckett's writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism .</s>

<s>could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me ?</s>

<s>is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social crises we face ?</s>

<s>or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves ?</s>

<s>I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions , because a man is not the same as his writing : in the last analysis , the questions had to be settled by the work itself .</s>

<s>nevertheless I was curious .</s>

<s>my curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher of literature , a Jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near Paris .</s>

<s>when Beckett's name came into the discussion , the priest grew loud and told me that Beckett hates life .</s>

<s>that , I thought , is at least one thing I can find out when we meet .</s>

<s>Beckett's appearance is rough-hewn Irish .</s>

<s>the features of his face are distinct , but not fine .</s>

<s>they look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel .</s>

<s>unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead , standing so high that the top falls gently over , as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle .</s>

<s>one might say it combines the man ;
own pride and humility .</s>

<s>for he has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the humility , perhaps of the same genesis , not to impose himself upon another .</s>

<s>his light blue eyes , set deep within the face , are actively and continually looking .</s>

<s>he seems , by some unconscious division of labor , to have given them that one function and no other , leaving communication to the rest of the face .</s>

<s>the mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile .</s>

<s>the voice is light in timbre , with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage .</s>

<s>the Irish accent is , as one would expect , combined with slight inflections from the French .</s>

<s>his tweed suit was a baggy gray and green .</s>

<s>he wore a brown knit sports shirt with no tie .</s>

<s>we walked down the Rue De L'Arcade , thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church .</s>

<s>the conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world-shattering .</s>

<s>for one thing , the world that Beckett sees is already shattered .</s>

<s>his talk turns to what he calls the mess , or sometimes this buzzing confusion .</s>

<s>I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation .</s>

<s>what appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words .</s>

<s>the confusion is not my invention .</s>

<s>we cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion .</s>

<s>it is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in .</s>

<s>the only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess .</s>

<s>it is not a mess you can make sense of .</s>

<s>I suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth , but Beckett did not take to the word truth .</s>

<s>what is more true than anything else ?</s>

<s>to swim is true , and to sink is true .</s>

<s>one is not more true than the other .</s>

<s>one cannot speak anymore of being , one must speak only of the mess .</s>

<s>when Heidegger and Sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence , they may be right , I don't know , but their language is too philosophical for me .</s>

<s>I am not a philosopher .</s>

<s>one can only speak of what is in front of him , and that now is simply the mess .</s>

<s>then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form .</s>

<s>until recently , art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things .</s>

<s>it has held them at bay .</s>

<s>it realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form .</s>

<s>how could the mess be admitted , because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be ?</s>

<s>but now we can keep it out no longer , because we have come into a time when it invades our experience at every moment .</s>

<s>it is there and it must be allowed in .</s>

<s>I granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously .</s>

<s>and why not ?</s>

<s>how , I asked , could chaos be admitted to chaos ?</s>

<s>would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ?</s>

<s>if we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form .</s>

<s>Beckett's own work is an example .</s>

<s>plays more highly formalized than Waiting For Godot , Endgame , and Krapp's Last Tape would be hard to find .</s>

<s>what I am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art .</s>

<s>it only means that there will be new form , and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else .</s>

<s>the form and the chaos remain separate .</s>

<s>the latter is not reduced to the former .</s>

<s>that is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation , because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates .</s>

<s>to find a form that accommodates the mess , that is the task of the artist now .</s>

<s>yet , I responded , could not similar things be said about the art of the past ?</s>

<s>is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify , demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable way ?</s>

<s>what is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory ?</s>

<s>isn't all art ambiguous ?</s>

<s>not this , he said , and gestured toward the Madeleine .</s>

<s>the classical lines of the church which Napoleon thought of as a Temple of Glory , dominated all the scene where we sat .</s>

<s>the Boulevard De La Madeleine , the Boulevard Malesherbes , and the Rue Royale ran to it with graceful flattery , bearing tidings of the Age of Reason .</s>

<s>not this .</s>

<s>this is clear .</s>

<s>this does not allow the mystery to invade us .</s>

<s>with classical art , all is settled .</s>

<s>but it is different at Chartres .</s>

<s>there is the unexplainable , and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer .</s>

<s>I asked about the battle between life and death in his plays .</s>

<s>Didi and Gogo hover on the edge of suicide ;
Hamm's world is death and Clov may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside .</s>

<s>is this life-death question a part of the chaos ?</s>

<s>yes .</s>

<s>if life and death did not both present themselves to us , there would be no inscrutability .</s>

<s>if there were only darkness , all would be clear .</s>

<s>it is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable .</s>

<s>take Augustine's doctrine of grace given and grace withheld : have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology ?</s>

<s>two thieves are crucified with Christ , one saved and the other damned .</s>

<s>how can we make sense of this division ?</s>

<s>in classical drama , such problems do not arise .</s>

<s>the destiny of Racine's Phedre is sealed from the beginning : she will proceed into the dark .</s>

<s>as she goes , she herself will be illuminated .</s>

<s>at the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination , but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark .</s>

<s>that is the play .</s>

<s>within this notion clarity is possible , but for us who are neither Greek nor Jansenist there is not such clarity .</s>

<s>the question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary -- total salvation .</s>

<s>but where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable .</s>

<s>the key word in my plays is perhaps .</s>

<s>given a theological lead , I asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays .</s>

<s>well , really there is none at all .</s>

<s>I have no religious feeling .</s>

<s>once I had a religious emotion .</s>

<s>it was at my first Communion .</s>

<s>no more .</s>

<s>my mother was deeply religious .</s>

<s>so was my brother .</s>

<s>he knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel .</s>

<s>my father had none .</s>

<s>the family was Protestant , but for me it was only irksome and I let it go .</s>

<s>my brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died .</s>

<s>at the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie .</s>

<s>Irish Catholicism is not attractive , but it is deeper .</s>

<s>when you pass a church on an Irish bus , all the hands flurry in the sign of the cross .</s>

<s>one day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs .</s>

<s>but do the plays deal with the same facets of experience religion must also deal with ?</s>

<s>yes , for they deal with distress .</s>

<s>some people object to this in my writing .</s>

<s>at a party an English intellectual -- so-called -- asked me why I write always about distress .</s>

<s>as if it were perverse to do so ]
he wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood .</s>

<s>I told him no , that I had had a very happy childhood .</s>

<s>then he thought me more perverse than ever .</s>

<s>I left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi .</s>

<s>on the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs : one asked for help for the blind , another help for orphans , and the third for relief for the war refugees .</s>

<s>one does not have to look for distress .</s>

<s>it is screaming at you even in the taxis of London .</s>

<s>lunch was over , and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of Paris screaming at us .</s>

<s>the personal quality of Samuel Beckett is similar to qualities I had found in the plays .</s>

<s>he says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern .</s>

<s>perhaps stands in place of commitment .</s>

<s>at the same time , he is plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly .</s>

<s>if there were only the mess , all would be clear ;
but there is also compassion .</s>

<s>as a Christian , I know I do not stand where Beckett stands , but I do see much of what he sees .</s>

<s>as a writer on the theater , I have paid close attention to the plays .</s>

<s>Harold Clurman is right to say that Waiting For Godot is a reflection ( he calls it a distorted reflection ) of the impasse and disarray of Europe's present politics , ethic , and common way of life .</s>

<s>yet it is not only Europe the play refers to .</s>

<s>Waiting For Godot sells even better in America than in France .</s>

<s>the consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America , but it is the consciousness that most mature societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture .</s>

<s>America is now joining Europe in this mature phase of development .</s>

<s>whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going on in the countries of Asia and Africa , and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold .</s>

<s>even Hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms never maintained that sex was all .</s>

<s>Hemingway's fiction is supported by a moral backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension .</s>

<s>and D. H. Lawrence , in Fantasia Of The Unconscious , protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive .</s>

<s>though sex in some form or other enters into all human activity and it was a good thing that Freud emphasized this aspect of human nature , it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex .</s>

<s>all is not sex , declared Lawrence .</s>

<s>man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy .</s>

<s>the creative urge , for example , transcends the body and the self .</s>

<s>but for the beat generation all is sex .</s>

<s>nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex .</s>

<s>for the beatnik , like the hipster , is in opposition to a society that is based on the repression of the sex instinct .</s>

<s>he has elevated sex -- not Eros or libido but pure , spontaneous , uninhibited sex -- to the rank of the godhead ;
it is Astarte , Ishtar , Venus , Yahwe , Dionysus , Christ , the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the body of the universe .</s>

<s>jazz is sex , marijuana is a stimulus to sex , the beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse .</s>

<s>Lawrence Lipton , in The Holy Barbarians , stresses that for the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure ;
it is a mystique , and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe of discourse .</s>

<s>the singular uncompromising force of their revolt against the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in a public place .</s>

<s>the dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression of ungratified sexual desire .</s>

<s>for this reason , too , their language is more forthright and earthy .</s>

<s>the beatniks crave a sexual experience in which their whole being participates .</s>

<s>it is therefore not surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity , for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy .</s>

<s>they withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety .</s>

<s>unlike the heroes and flappers of the lost generation , they disdain the art of necking and petting .</s>

<s>that is reserved for the squares .</s>

<s>if they avoid the use of the pungent , outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo ;
it is sacred .</s>

<s>as Lipton , the prophet of the beat generation , declares : in the sexual act , the beat are filled with mana , the divine power .</s>

<s>this is far from the vulgar , leering sexuality of the middle-class square in heat .</s>

<s>this is the Holy Grail these knights of the orgasm pursue , this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they respond .</s>

<s>if Wilhelm Reich is the Moses who has led them out of the Egypt of sexual slavery , Dylan Thomas is the poet who offers them the Dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence in liquor , marijuana , sex , and jazz .</s>

<s>in addition , they have been converted to Zen Buddhism , with its glorification of all that is natural and mysteriously alive , the sense that everything in the world is flowing .</s>

<s>thus , paradoxically , the beat writers resort to religious metaphors : they are in search of mana , the spiritual , the numinous , but not anything connected with formal religion .</s>

<s>what they are after is the beatific vision .</s>

<s>and Zen Buddhism , though it is extremely difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled , helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through sexual release .</s>

<s>the style of life chosen by the beat generation , the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own , is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience .</s>

<s>jazz is good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided sexual effect .</s>

<s>jazz is the musical language of sex , the vocabulary of the orgasm ;
indeed , it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz , by freeing the listener of his inhibitions , can have therapeutic value .</s>

<s>that is why , the argument runs , the squares are so fearful of jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it .</s>

<s>instead of giving themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them , they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes for satisfaction .</s>

<s>thus jazz is transmuted into something holy , the sacred road to integration of being .</s>

<s>jazz , like sex , is a mystique .</s>

<s>it is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative impulse in unfettered man .</s>

<s>the mystique of sex , combined with marijuana and jazz , is intended to provide a design for living .</s>

<s>those who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free , their instincts put at the service of the imagination .</s>

<s>righteous in their denunciation of all that makes for death , the beat prophets bid all men become cool cats ;
let them learn to swing freely , to let go , to become authentically themselves , and then perhaps civilization will be saved .</s>

<s>the beatnik , seceding from a society that is fatally afflicted with a deathward drive , is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present .</s>

<s>if he is the child of nothingness , if he is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars , then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil .</s>

<s>he will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive , even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth .</s>

<s>that is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians ;
they will destroy the shrines , temples , museums , and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life they believe in .</s>

<s>apart from the categorical imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm , the only affirmation they are capable of making is that art is their only refuge .</s>

<s>their writing , born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality , reflects the extremity of their existential alienation .</s>

<s>the mind has betrayed them , reason is the foe of life ;
they will trust only their physical sensations , the wisdom of the body , the holy promptings of the unconscious .</s>

<s>with lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate , but their faith in love , inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz , culminates in the climax of the orgasm .</s>

<s>their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath , rootless and irresponsible .</s>

<s>their rebellion against authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt characteristic of the juvenile delinquent .</s>

<s>and the life they lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive , even though they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit -- writing , painting , music .</s>

<s>they are non-conformists on principle .</s>

<s>when they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth , the rage of repudiation , the ecstasy of negation .</s>

<s>it is sex that obsesses them , sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed .</s>

<s>what they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can inspire the Muse .</s>

<s>monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle class continue to suffer , whereas the beatnik has the courage to break out of that prison of respectability .</s>

<s>one girl describes her past , her succession of broken marriages , the abortions she has had and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she must justify her passion .</s>

<s>if it is an honest feeling , then why should she not yield to it ?</s>

<s>most often , she says , it's the monogamous relationship that is dishonest .</s>

<s>there is nothing holy in wedlock .</s>

<s>this girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist who disapproves of her life .</s>

<s>she finds married life stifling and every prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous .</s>

<s>this confession serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution : the craving for sensation for its own sake , the need for change , for new experiences .</s>

<s>boredom is death .</s>

<s>in the realm of physical sensations , sex reigns supreme .</s>

<s>hence the beatniks sustain themselves on marijuana , jazz , free swinging poetry , exhausting themselves in orgies of sex ;
some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and lose contact with reality .</s>

<s>one beat poet composes a poem , Lines On A Tijuana John , which contains a few happy hints for survival .</s>

<s>the new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must move toward simplicity .</s>

<s>the professed mission of this disaffiliated generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they produce is unfortunately disordered , nourished solely on the hysteria of negation .</s>

<s>who are the creative representatives of this movement ?</s>

<s>nymphomaniacs , junkies , homosexuals , drug addicts , lesbians , alcoholics , the weak , the frustrated , the irresolute , the despairing , the derelicts and outcasts of society .</s>

<s>they embrace independent poverty , usually with a shack-up partner who will help support them .</s>

<s>they are full of contempt for the institution of matrimony .</s>

<s>their previous legalized marriages do not count , for they hold the laws of the state null and void .</s>

<s>they feel they are leagued against a hostile , persecutory world , faced with the concerted malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings , the police .</s>

<s>this is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending their way of life , their search for wholeness , though their actual existence fails to reach these religious heights .</s>

<s>one beatnik got the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up .</s>

<s>what obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk ?</s>

<s>sex as the creative principle of the universe , the secret of primitive religion , the life of myth .</s>

<s>everything in the final analysis reduced itself to sexual symbolism .</s>

<s>in his chapter on The Loveways Of The Beat Generation , Lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details .</s>

<s>no one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in West Venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the group .</s>

<s>the women who come to West Venice , having forsaken radicalism , are interested in living only for the moment , in being constantly on the move .</s>

<s>others who are attracted to this Mecca of the beat generation are homosexuals , heroin addicts , and smalltime hoodlums .</s>

<s>those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks .</s>

<s>since the homosexuals widely use marijuana , they do not have to be initiated .</s>

<s>part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana .</s>

<s>as Lipton puts it : The Eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana with far greater force , as a unifying principle in human relationships , than at any other time except , perhaps , in the mutual metaphysical orgasms .</s>

<s>the magic circle is , in fact , a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical orgasm .</s>

<s>under the influence of marijuana the beatnik comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being .</s>

<s>carried high on this charge , he composes magical poetry that captures the organic rhythms of life in words .</s>

<s>if he thus achieves a lyrical , dreamlike , drugged intensity , he pays the price for his indulgence by producing work -- Allen Ginsberg's Howl is a striking example of this tendency -- that is disoriented , Dionysian but without depth and without Apollonian control .</s>

<s>for drugs are in themselves no royal road to creativity .</s>

<s>how is the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic derangement of senses .</s>

<s>if love reflects the nature of man , as Ortega Y Gasset believes , if the person in love betrays decisively what he is by his behavior in love , then the writers of the beat generation are creating a new literary genre .</s>

<s>there were fences in the old days when we were children .</s>

<s>across the front of a yard and down the side , they were iron , either spiked along the top or arched in half circles .</s>

<s>alley fences were made of solid boards higher than one's head , but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them .</s>

<s>side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses ;
front fences were covered with Virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle .</s>

<s>square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of cast-iron foliage ;
they were topped by steeples complete in every detail : high-pitched roof , pinnacle , and narrow gable .</s>

<s>on these posts the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang .</s>

<s>the only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree .</s>

<s>the primary quality of that view seems , now , to have been its quietness , but that cannot at the time have impressed us .</s>

<s>what one actually remembers is its greenness .</s>

<s>from high in the tree , the whole block lay within range of the eye , but the ground was almost nowhere visible .</s>

<s>one looked down on a sea of leaves , a breaking wave of flower .</s>

<s>every path from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor , and every yard had its fruit trees .</s>

<s>in the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet-shrub , snowball , rose-of-Sharon and balm-of-Gilead .</s>

<s>from above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block .</s>

<s>that was one epoch : the apple-tree epoch .</s>

<s>another had ended before it began .</s>

<s>time is a queer thing and memory a queerer ;
the tricks that time plays with memory and memory with time are queerest of all .</s>

<s>from maturity one looks back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large .</s>

<s>in a stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water ;
the mill-pond is quiet , its surface dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water in it .</s>

<s>time in the sum is nothing .</s>

<s>and yet -- a year to a child is an eternity , and in the memory that phase of one's being -- a certain mental landscape -- will seem to have endured without beginning and without end .</s>

<s>the part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate , it could have been like that for only a little while ;
but true memory does not count nor add : it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time .</s>

<s>once , then -- for how many years or how few does not matter -- my world was bound round by fences , when I was too small to reach the apple tree bough , to twist my knee over it and pull myself up .</s>

<s>that world was in scale with my own smallness .</s>

<s>I have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole -- that I could not see -- but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory : wind-blown , frost-bitten , white chrysanthemums beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of November ;
ripe pears lying in long grass , to be turned over by a dusty-slippered foot , cautiously , lest bees still worked in the ragged , brown-edged holes ;
hot-colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch , where we passed on our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it .</s>

<s>it was mother who planted the verbenas .</s>

<s>I think that my grandmother was not an impassioned gardener : she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and grandchildren .</s>

<s>my great-grandmother , I have been told , made her garden her great pride ;
she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar ;
she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed , and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house .</s>

<s>these my grandmother left in their places ( they are still there , more persistent and longer-lived than the generations of man ) and planted others like them , that flourished without careful tending .</s>

<s>three of these only were protected from us by stern commandment : the roses , whose petals might not be collected until they had fallen , to be made into perfume or rose-tea to drink ;
the peonies , whose tight sticky buds would be blighted by the laying on of a finger , although they were not apparently harmed by the ants that crawled over them ;
and the poppies .</s>

<s>I have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap , unfolded , and shook out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals .</s>

<s>other flowers we might gather as we pleased : myrtle and white violets from beneath the lilacs ;
the lilacs themselves , that bloomed so prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach ;
snowballs ;
hollyhock blossoms that , turned upside down , make pink-petticoated ladies ;
and the little , dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere .</s>

<s>more potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae which are of the very stuff of the mind , intrinsic , because they were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them .</s>

<s>flowers , stones , and small creatures , living and dead .</s>

<s>pale yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite ;
seed-pods of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch ;
red-and-yellow columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and eaten for the honey in them ;
morning-glory buds which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag ;
bright flowers from the trumpet vine that made gloves on the ends of ten waggling fingers .</s>

<s>fuzzy caterpillars , snails with their sensitive horns , struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded to spit tobacco , spit .</s>

<s>dead fledgling birds , their squashed-looking nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags .</s>

<s>and the cast shell of a locust , straw-colored and transparent , weighing nothing , fragile but entire , with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down its back .</s>

<s>every morning early , in the summer , we searched the trunks of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells , carefully detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung , and stabled them , a weird faery herd , in an angle between the high roots of the tulip tree , where no grass grew in the dense shade .</s>

<s>we collected lucky stones -- all the creamy translucent pebbles , worn smooth and round , that we could find in the driveway .</s>

<s>when these had been pocketed , we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their dull exteriors indicated .</s>

<s>we showed them to each other and said would you have guessed ?</s>

<s>squatting on our haunches beside the flat stone we broke them on , we were safe behind the high closed gates at the end of the drive : safe from interruption and the observation and possible amusement of the passers-by .</s>

<s>thus shielded , we played many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness ;
even when the fences became a part of the game -- when a vine-embowered gate-post was the Sleeping Beauty's enchanted castle , or when Rapunzel let down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire , even then we paid little heed to those who went by on the path outside .</s>

<s>we enjoyed a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school .</s>

<s>in the heat of the summer , the garden solitudes were ours alone ;
our elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch .</s>

<s>they never troubled themselves about us while we were playing , because the fence formed such a definite boundary and don't go outside the gate was a command so impossible of misinterpretation .</s>

<s>we were not , however , entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street .</s>

<s>we were forbidden to swing on the gates , lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way , but we could stand on them , when they were latched , rest our chins on the top , and stare and stare , committing to memory , quite unintentionally , all the details that lay before our eyes .</s>

<s>the street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees , and silence was a weight , almost palpable , in the air .</s>

<s>every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell away again , crushed beneath it .</s>

<s>a hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter , the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees , and loose straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves .</s>

<s>a wheel squeaked on a hub , was still , and squeaked again .</s>

<s>if a child watched its progress he whispered , hay , hay , load of hay -- make a wish and turn away , and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horses' feet returned no more .</s>

<s>when the hay wagon had gone , and an interval passed , a huckster's cart might turn the corner .</s>

<s>the horse walked , the reins were slack , the huckster rode with bowed shoulders , his forearms across his knees .</s>

<s>sleepily , as if half-reluctant to break the silence , he lifted his voice : rhu-beb-ni-ice nice fresh rhu-beb today ]
the lazy sing-song was spaced in time like the drone of a bumble-bee .</s>

<s>no one seemed to hear him , no one heeded .</s>

<s>the horse plodded on , and he repeated his call .</s>

<s>it became so monotonous as to seem a part of the quietness .</s>

<s>after his passage , the street was empty again .</s>

<s>the sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down ;
the trees' shadows circled from street to sidewalk , from sidewalk to lawn .</s>

<s>at four-o'clock , or four-thirty , the coming of the newsboy marked the end of the day ;
he tossed a paper toward every front door , and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read what their neighbors had been doing .</s>

<s>the streets of any county town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer ;
they were like this fifty-odd years ago , and yesterday .</s>

<s>but the fences were still in place fifty-odd years ago , and when we stood on the gate to look over , the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving stones with grass between and on both sides .</s>

<s>the curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees .</s>

<s>opposite every gate was a hitching post or a stone carriage-step , set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse .</s>

<s>the street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center ;
it was mud in wet weather and dust , ankle-deep , in dry , and could be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones .</s>

<s>it had a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since .</s>

<s>the hoofmarks of cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as numerous as the traces of shod horses .</s>

<s>cows were kept in backyard barns , boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town , and familiar to the ear , morning and evening , were the boys' coaxing voices , the thud of hooves , and the thwack of a stick on cowhide .</s>

<s>it is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story , because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious , riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant for Mann's work .</s>

<s>the wife , Amra , and her lover are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality , voluptuous and indolent , possibly a mischief maker , with a kind of luxurious cunning to set against her apparent simplicity , her birdlike brain .</s>

<s>Lautner , for his part , belonged to the present-day race of small artists , who do not demand the utmost of themselves , and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as wretched little poseurs , the devastating indictment they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order , and the somewhat extreme prophecy , so far not fulfilled : they will be destroyed .</s>

<s>the trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as well .</s>

<s>his appearance as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience ;
it is a spectacle absolutely painful , an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit , untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation .</s>

<s>at the same time the multiple transvestitism involved -- the fat man as girl and as baby , as coquette pretending to be a baby -- touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby's , upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life .</s>

<s>the music which Lautner has composed for this episode is for the most part rather pretty and perfectly banal .</s>

<s>but it is characteristic of him , we are told , his little artifice , to be able to introduce into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art .</s>

<s>and this occurs now , at the refrain of Jacoby's song -- at the point , in fact , of the name Lizzy -- ;
a modulation described as almost a stroke of genius .</s>

<s>a miracle , a revelation , it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude .</s>

<s>it is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife's infidelity .</s>

<s>by the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience ;
he collapses , and dies .</s>

<s>in the work of every artist , I suppose , there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it is all about ;
not less strikingly so for being mysterious , as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image , a single moment .</s>

<s>so here .</s>

<s>the horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby ;
the epiphany of that quivering flesh ;
the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent , mindless sensuality and sharp , shrewd talent , cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which , however , does not know how to attack the problem of suffering ) ;
the miraculous way in which music , revelation and death are associated in a single instant -- all this seems a triumph of art , a rather desperate art , in itself ;
beyond itself , also , it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's work .</s>

<s>when I try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance , I come up with the following ideas , which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay .</s>

<s>love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann's heroes .</s>

<s>the dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love .</s>

<s>the release , the freedom , involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible ;
and the motion toward it brings disaster .</s>

<s>this prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art ;
it is particularly the artist ( Tonio Kroger , Aschenbach , Leverkuhn ) who suffers from it .</s>

<s>the specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the breakthrough in the realm of art .</s>

<s>again , the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child .</s>

<s>finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notions of dressing up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with Cipolla ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of Mann's stories .</s>

<s>we shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates .</s>

<s>for the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby , at the moment of his collapse , all these elements come together in prophetic parody .</s>

<s>professionally a lawyer , that is to say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up , disguised -- that is , paradoxically , revealed -- as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child .</s>

<s>that this abandonment takes place on a stage , during an artistic performance , is enough to associate Jacoby with art , and to bring down upon him the punishment for art ;
that is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in Mann's stories who produces illusion , and this is true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature , technique , magic , guilt and suffering , are divided in this story between Jacoby and Lautner .</s>

<s>it appears that the dominant tendency of Mann's early tales , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic .</s>

<s>in a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same .</s>

<s>something of this can be learned from The Way To The Churchyard ( 1901 ) , an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure .</s>

<s>there is no more plot than that ;
only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper account of such an incident would give .</s>

<s>the artistic interest , then , lies in what the encounter may be made to represent , in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness .</s>

<s>the first sentence , with its platitudinous irony , announces an emblematic intent : the way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad , ran beside it all the way to the end ;
that is to say , to the churchyard .</s>

<s>and the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction .</s>

<s>the highroad , one might say at first , belongs to life , while the way to the churchyard belongs to death .</s>

<s>but that is too simple , and won't hold up .</s>

<s>as the first sentence suggests , both roads belong to death in the end .</s>

<s>but the highroad , according to the description of its traffic , belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death , while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life : a suffering form , an existence wholly comprised in the awareness of death .</s>

<s>thus , on the highroad , a troop of soldiers marched in their own dust and sang , while on the footpath one man walks alone .</s>

<s>this man's isolation is not merely momentary , it is permanent .</s>

<s>he is a widower , his three children are dead , he has no one left on earth ;
also he is a drunk , and has lost his job on that account .</s>

<s>his name is Praisegod Piepsam , and he is rather fully described as to his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister type in the author's repertory -- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic strangers in Death In Venice , for example , who represent some combination of cadaver , exotic , and psychopomp .</s>

<s>this strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather than the highroad .</s>

<s>the cyclist , a sufficiently commonplace young fellow , is not named but identified simply as Life -- that and a license number , which Piepsam uses in addressing him .</s>

<s>life points out that everybody uses this path , and starts to ride on .</s>

<s>Piepsam tries to stop him by force , receives a push in the chest from Life , and is left standing in impotent and growing rage , while a crowd begins to gather .</s>

<s>his rage assumes a religious form ;
that is , on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness , Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life -- not only the cyclist now , but the audience , the world , as well : all you light-headed breed .</s>

<s>this passion brings on a fit which proves fatal .</s>

<s>then an ambulance comes along , and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away .</s>

<s>this is simple enough , but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant .</s>

<s>the season , between spring and summer , belongs to life in its carefree aspect .</s>

<s>Piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because he cannot stop the cyclist , but also because God will not stop him ;
as Piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments : his justice is not of this world .</s>

<s>life is further characterized , in antithesis to Piepsam , as animal : the image of a dog , which appears at several places , is first given as the criterion of amiable , irrelevant interest aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle : a dog in a wagon is admirable , a pleasure to contemplate ;
another wagon has no dog , and therefore is devoid of interest .</s>

<s>Piepsam calls the cyclist cur and puppy among other things , and at the crisis of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into his face .</s>

<s>the ambulance is drawn by two charming little horses .</s>

<s>Piepsam is not , certainly , religious in any conventional sense .</s>

<s>his religiousness is intimately , or dialectically , connected with his sinfulness ;
the two may in fact be identical .</s>

<s>his unsuccessful strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings ;
he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home , and before this wardrobe Praisegod Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees , and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue -- and still in the end capitulated .</s>

<s>the cyclist , by contrast , blond and blue-eyed , is simply unreflective , unproblematic Life , blithe and carefree .</s>

<s>he made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth .</s>

<s>Piepsam is grotesque , a disturbing parody ;
his end is ridiculous and trivial .</s>

<s>he is a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard .</s>

<s>but he is more interesting than the others , the ones who come from the highroad to watch him , more interesting than Life considered as a cyclist .</s>

<s>and if I have gone into so much detail about so small a work , that is because it is also so typical a work , representing the germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in Mann's writing : the crude sketch of Piepsam contains , in its critical , destructive and self-destructive tendencies , much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of , for instance , Naphta and Leverkuhn .</s>

<s>in method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for realism , anticipates a kind of musical composition , as well as a kind of fictional composition , in which , as Leverkuhn says , there shall be nothing unthematic .</s>

<s>it resembles , too , pictures such as Durer and Bruegel did , in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary , the representation of a proverb , for example , or a deadly sin .</s>

<s>Gladius Dei ( 1902 ) resembles The Way To The Churchyard in its representation of a conflict between light and dark , between Life and a spirit of criticism , negation , melancholy , but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict .</s>

<s>the monk Savonarola , brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background of Munich at the turn of the century , protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art-shop of M. Bluthenzweig ;
in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled , according to gossip , upon the painter's mistress .</s>

<s>Hieronymus , like Piepsam , makes his protest quite in vain , and his rejection , though not fatal , is ridiculous and humiliating ;
he is simply thrown out of the shop by the porter .</s>

<s>on the street outside , Hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world , such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in Florence , and prophetically he issues his curse : gladius Dei super terram cito et velociter .</s>

<s>the reality to which they respond is rationally empty and their art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world .</s>

<s>their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason .</s>

<s>these polar concerns ( imitation vs. formalism ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing over a long period of time .</s>

<s>the breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes .</s>

<s>thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual qualities , and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi-mechanistic powers .</s>

<s>the image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery .</s>

<s>the image of God has simply disappeared .</s>

<s>all such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is , he can at least invent an artistic reality which is its own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved .</s>

<s>the person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems .</s>

<s>whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive , that they belong together .</s>

<s>without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ) , the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being .</s>

<s>and although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written .</s>

<s>for better or worse we cannot regard imitation in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism .</s>

<s>a broader concept of imitation is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention is important , that the artist's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic causal factors out of which it arises .</s>

<s>on the other hand , we cannot regard artistic invention as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times in which it occurs .</s>

<s>we need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism .</s>

<s>accordingly , it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which I shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which I shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter ) .</s>

<s>the mimetic imagination in the arts the word mimesis ( imitation ) is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle .</s>

<s>for Plato , imitation is twice removed from reality , being a poor copy of physical appearance , which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence .</s>

<s>all artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are imitations of imitations and are completely superseded by the truth value of dialectic , the proper use of the inquiring intellect .</s>

<s>in Plato's judgment , the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young , prior to the full development of their intellectual powers .</s>

<s>presupposed in Plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight , in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom .</s>

<s>Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and , like Plato , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level .</s>

<s>the Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are modes of imitation , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato .</s>

<s>but Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths .</s>

<s>for both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis , in contrast to the power of dialectic , is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality .</s>

<s>the central concern of Erich Auerbach's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved .</s>

<s>following the theme of Incarnation in the Gospels , the Christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events figures of divine power and reality .</s>

<s>here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent .</s>

<s>artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement of all persons , however humble , in a divine drama .</s>

<s>the artist , unlike the philosopher , is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified high levels of abstraction .</s>

<s>he is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped .</s>

<s>I have chosen to use the word mimesis in its Christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which , as in the Christian mind , are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserved , as in the Greek mind , only to moments of theoretical reflection .</s>

<s>in the first instance , mimesis is here used to mean the recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms of abstract ideas or conventional designations .</s>

<s>by image is meant not only a visual presentation , but also remembered sensations of any of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined therewith .</s>

<s>this is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated .</s>

<s>mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience , in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself .</s>

<s>the images themselves , like their counterparts in experience , are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately ;
they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one another .</s>

<s>they bring an inextricable component of value within themselves , with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality .</s>

<s>as in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them , so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images .</s>

<s>mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense .</s>

<s>a word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a recognizable object , the mere picturing of a scene tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings .</s>

<s>similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field .</s>

<s>a truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy .</s>

<s>the mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials .</s>

<s>when words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance .</s>

<s>these are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice .</s>

<s>the presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely understood .</s>

<s>underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed .</s>

<s>experience is not seen , as it is in classical rationalism , as presenting us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and registering their character , movements , and changes on the tabula rasa of an uninvolved intellect .</s>

<s>neither is primary experience understood according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense organs .</s>

<s>primary feelings of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects ( houses , trees , implements , etc. )</s>

<s>nor a collection of isolated and neutral sensory qualities .</s>

<s>in contrast to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers .</s>

<s>the most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ;
a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part .</s>

<s>these desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved , some working for one's good , others threatening ill .</s>

<s>gone is the tabula rasa of the mind .</s>

<s>in its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught .</s>

<s>the principal defender of this view of primary experience as causal efficacy is Alfred North Whitehead .</s>

<s>our most elemental and unavoidable impressions , he says , are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own , which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future .</s>

<s>we feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening .</s>

<s>later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of value , but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience .</s>

<s>it takes a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern , devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection .</s>

<s>Whitehead is here questioning David Hume's understanding of the nature of experience ;
he is questioning , also , every epistemology which stems from Hume's presupposition that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy , and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world , not directly perceived .</s>

<s>what Hume calls sensation is what Whitehead calls perception in the mode of presentational immediacy which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy .</s>

<s>as long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense data , most of the quality and interconnectedness of existence loses its objectivity , becomes an invention of consciousness , and the result is a philosophical scepticism .</s>

<s>Whitehead contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding , for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail , is initially given in the way man feels the world .</s>

<s>in this respect experience is broader and full of a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct .</s>

<s>a chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is one of derivation from the past .</s>

<s>both I and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the entity which I now am .</s>

<s>after only eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration , though in a slight degree , to be sure .</s>

<s>there were more indications by the mid-twentieth century .</s>

<s>I leave it to the statisticians to say what they were , but I noticed several a few years ago , during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg .</s>

<s>in town after town my companion pointed out the Negro school and the White school , and in every instance the former made a better appearance ( it was newer , for one thing ) .</s>

<s>it really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by Booker T. Washington had been going on .</s>

<s>but with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impaired .</s>

<s>for over a hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them .</s>

<s>it's infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly .</s>

<s>by what right of superior virtue , Southerners ask , do the people of the North do this ?</s>

<s>the traditional strategy of the South has been to expose the vices of the North , to demonstrate that the North possessed no superior virtue , to show the world that as James's Christopher Newman said to his adversaries ) however bad I may be , you're not quite the people to say it .</s>

<s>in the pre-Civil War years , the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North .</s>

<s>at the present time , the counter-attack takes the line that there's no more of the true spirit of integration in the North than in the South .</s>

<s>the line is a pretty good one .</s>

<s>people talk about the law of the land .</s>

<s>the expression has become quite a cliche .</s>

<s>but people can't be made to integrate , socialize ( the two are inseparable by Southern standards ) by law .</s>

<s>I was having lunch not long ago ( apologies to N. V. Peale ) with three distinguished historians ( one specializing in the European Middle Ages , one in American history , and one in the Far East ) , and I asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with deliberate speed , majestic instancy ( Francis Thompson's words for the Hound Of Heaven's Pursuit ) by judicial fiat .</s>

<s>they didn't seem to be able to think of any .</s>

<s>a Virginia judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change .</s>

<s>but I suspect that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation -- the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he said , they make a desert , and call it peace ( solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant .
)</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>moreover , the law of the land is not irrevocable ;
it can be changed ;

<s>Mr. Justice Taney's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the North , and soon became a dead letter .</s>

<s>prohibition was the law of the land , but it was unpopular ( how many of us oldsters took up drinking in prohibition days , drinking was so gay , so fashionable , especially in the sophisticated Northeast ]
) and was repealed .</s>

<s>the cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history .</s>

<s>the Declaration of Independence says that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed .</s>

<s>the phrase consent of the governed needs a hard look .</s>

<s>how do we define it ?</s>

<s>is the consent of the governed a numerical majority ?</s>

<s>Calhoun dealt with this question in his Disquisition On Government .</s>

<s>to guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority , Calhoun developed his theory of concurrent majority , which , he said , by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , prevents all partial or local legislation .</s>

<s>who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community ?</s>

<s>that regional peculiarities do not still exist ?</s>

<s>that the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region ?</s>

<s>who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of the consent of the governed ?</s>

<s>circumstances alter cases .</s>

<s>a friend of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell .</s>

<s>he seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere .</s>

<s>I murmured something about a possible difference between New Mexico's history and Mississippi's .</s>

<s>one can meet with aloofness almost anywhere : the THIDIU viewpoint , It Doesn't Affect Us ]
Southern Liberals ( there are a good many ) -- especially if they're rich -- often exhibit blithe insouciance .</s>

<s>the trouble here is that it's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything .</s>

<s>you've already sent your daughter to Miss J select academy for girls and your son to Mr. J select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity .</s>

<s>if there's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there's always New England .</s>

<s>New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , South as well as West .</s>

<s>they may even enroll a colored student or two for show , though he usually turns out to be from Thailand , or any place other than the American South .</s>

<s>it would be interesting to know how much integration there is in the famous , fashionable colleges and prep schools of New England .</s>

<s>a recent newspaper report said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one thousand at Yale ;
that is , about one-half of one per cent , which looks pretty tokenish to me , especially in an institution which professes to be national .</s>

<s>I must confess that I prefer the Liberal who is personally affected , who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith .</s>

<s>I leave out of account the question of the best interests of the children , the question of what their best interests really are .</s>

<s>I'm talking about the grand manner of the Liberal -- North and South -- who is not affected personally .</s>

<s>if these people were denied a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice ?
)</s>

<s>, what voices would be left ?</s>

<s>who is involved willy nilly ?</s>

<s>well , after everybody has followed the New England pattern of segregating one's children into private schools , only the poor folks are left .</s>

<s>and it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction .</s>

<s>a dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grew up in the South and has spent many years in New England , said to me not long ago : I can't forgive New England for rejecting all complicity .</s>

<s>being a teacher of American literature , I remembered Whittier's Massachusetts To Virginia , where he said : but that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone , and reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown .</s>

<s>there is a legend ( Hawthorne records it in his English Notebooks .</s>

<s>and one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page ) to the effect that the Mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves .</s>

<s>whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value .</s>

<s>complicity is an embarrassing word .</s>

<s>it is something which most of us try to get out from under .</s>

<s>like the cowboy in Stephen Crane's Blue Hotel , we run around crying , well , I didn't do anything , did I ?</s>

<s>Robert Penn Warren puts it this way in Brother To Dragons : the recognition of complicity is the beginning of innocence , where innocence , I think , means about the same thing as redemption .</s>

<s>a man must be able to say , Father , I have sinned , or there is no hope for him .</s>

<s>Lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his Second Inaugural that God gives to both North and South this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense came .</s>

<s>he also spoke of the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited toil .</s>

<s>Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade .</s>

<s>after how many generations is such wealth ( mounting all the while through the manipulations of high finance ) purified of taint ?</s>

<s>it is a question which New Englanders long ago put out of their minds .</s>

<s>but didn't they get off too easy ?</s>

<s>New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence , as Jefferson explained in his Autobiography : the clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it .</s>

<s>our Northern brethren also I believe felt a little tender under those censures ;

<s>isn't it a bit odd that the three states of Southern New England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been J & J colleges ?</s>

<s>was it supposed , perchance , that J & J ( vocational training , that is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flooded that part of the New England world in the post-Civil War period , the immigrants having been brought in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West ?</s>

<s>is it not ironical that Roger Williams's state , Rhode Island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ?</s>

<s>in the early days of a homogeneous population , the public school was quite satisfactory .</s>

<s>among the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English .</s>

<s>of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner Von Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago .</s>

<s>equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present .</s>

<s>in the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself .</s>

<s>Heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family .</s>

<s>on his father's side he was of German descent , on his mother's he came of the old Swedish nobility .</s>

<s>the family estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake Vattern in south central Sweden .</s>

<s>it is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations .</s>

<s>as a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of Sweden's ancient glory .</s>

<s>he liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part .</s>

<s>being somewhat delicate in health , at the age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe , for which he at once developed a passion , so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad , at first in Italy , then in Greece , Egypt , Asia Minor , and Palestine .</s>

<s>in one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth .</s>

<s>deciding to become a painter , he entered the studio of Gerome in Paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction .</s>

<s>he gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , The Happy Artists .</s>

<s>I scanned the world through printed symbol swart , and through the beggar's rags I strove to see the inner man .</s>

<s>I looked unceasingly with my cold mind and with my burning heart .</s>

<s>in this final line , we have the key to his nature .</s>

<s>few writers have better understood their deepest selves .</s>

<s>Heidenstam could never be satisfied by surface .</s>

<s>it may , however , be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris .</s>

<s>the first result of Heidenstam's long sojourn abroad was a volume of poems , Pilgrimage And Wander-Years ( Vallfart och Vandringsar ) , published in 1888 .</s>

<s>it was a brilliant debut , so much so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets , as did Byron's Childe Harold .</s>

<s>professor Fredrik Book , Sweden's foremost critic of the period , acclaims it as follows : in this we have the verse of a painter ;
strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid .</s>

<s>in a bold , sometimes careless , form there is nothing academic ;
all is seen and felt and experienced , the observation is sharp and the imagination lively .</s>

<s>the young poet-painter reproduces the French life of the streets ;
he tells stories of the Thousand and One Nights , and conjures up before us the bazaars of Damascus .</s>

<s>in the care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence , and for that reason he loves it .</s>

<s>and yet amid all the gay hedonism in Pilgrimage And Wander-Years is a cycle of short poems , Thoughts In Loneliness , filled with brooding , melancholy , and sombre longing .</s>

<s>of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as Nameless And Immortal , which at once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language .</s>

<s>it celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of Neptune at Paestum , next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian classic style now in existence .</s>

<s>on the eve of his return to their native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection .</s>

<s>the supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled , says the wife , her husband has achieved immortality .</s>

<s>not so , he answers , it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal .</s>

<s>the man's true reputation is his work .</s>

<s>the short poems grouped at the end of the volume as Thoughts in Loneliness is , as Professor Book indicated , in sharp contrast with the others .</s>

<s>it consists of fragmentary personal revelations , such as The Spark : there is a spark dwells deep within my soul .</s>

<s>to get it out into the daylight's glow is my life's aim both first and last , the whole .</s>

<s>it slips away , it burns and tortures me .</s>

<s>that little spark is all the wealth I know , that little spark is my life's misery .</s>

<s>a dominant motive is the poet's longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations : not men-folk , but the fields where I would stray , the stones where as a child I used to play .</s>

<s>he is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading .</s>

<s>what he really wants is to find a sacred cause to which he can honestly devote himself .</s>

<s>this restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in Sweden .</s>

<s>his cause was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present .</s>

<s>he did not , however , find himself at once .</s>

<s>his next major work , completed in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled Hans Alienus , which Professor Book describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth .</s>

<s>the hero , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East , a sort of Faustus type , who , to quote from Professor Book again , even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life .</s>

<s>he is driven back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of Tiveden .</s>

<s>from this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self .</s>

<s>by the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions .</s>

<s>he did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with things as they were .</s>

<s>like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity .</s>

<s>he saw Sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism , indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory .</s>

<s>Strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear down the old structures and build anew from the ground up .</s>

<s>Heidenstam's conception , on the contrary , was to revive the present by the memories of the past .</s>

<s>whether in prose or poetry , all of Heidenstam's later work was concerned with Sweden .</s>

<s>with the first of a group of historical novels , the Charles Men ( Karolinerna ) , published in 1897-8 , he achieved the masterpiece of his career .</s>

<s>in scope and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy's War And Peace .</s>

<s>about one-third as long , it is less intimate and detailed , but better coordinated , more concise and more dramatic .</s>

<s>though it centers around the brilliant and enigmatic figure of Charles 12 , the true hero is not finally the king himself .</s>

<s>hence the title of the book , referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king ;
on the fatal battlefield of Poltava , to quote from the novel , the wreath he twined for himself slipped down upon his people .</s>

<s>The Charles Men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories , each depicting a special phase of the general subject .</s>

<s>somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader , eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind in literature .</s>

<s>they comprise a great variety of scene and interest : grim episodes of war , idyllic interludes , superb canvases of world-shaking events , and delightfully humorous sketches of odd characters .</s>

<s>the general effect is tragic .</s>

<s>almost nothing is said of Charles' spectacular victories , the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat .</s>

<s>to carry out this exalted conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale .</s>

<s>his peculiar gift , as had been suggested before , is his intensity .</s>

<s>George Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style .</s>

<s>of few authors is this more true than of Heidenstam .</s>

<s>The Charles Men has a tremendous range of characters , of common folk even more than of major figures .</s>

<s>the career of Charles 12 is obviously very similar to that of Napoleon .</s>

<s>his ideal was Alexander of Macedon , as Napoleon's was Julius Caesar .</s>

<s>his purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice .</s>

<s>each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god .</s>

<s>each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him .</s>

<s>each is still glorified as a national hero .</s>

<s>the first half of The Charles Men , ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709 , is more dramatically coherent than the second .</s>

<s>after the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous .</s>

<s>like Napoleon , he was the worst of losers .</s>

<s>there are , however , some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part , concerning the reactions of the Swedes in adversity .</s>

<s>then more than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness .</s>

<s>this comes out in When The Bells Ring , which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes .</s>

<s>in The King's Ride , Charles breaks out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regains his old self , escapes from Turkey , and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years .</s>

<s>he finds it in utter misery and desolation .</s>

<s>all his people ask for is no more war .</s>

<s>but he plunges into yet another , this time with Norway , and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall , being only thirty-six years of age when he died .</s>

<s>he had become king at fifteen .</s>

<s>then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling .</s>

<s>from being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden .</s>

<s>this is brought out in the next to last chapter of the book , A Hero's Funeral , written in the form of an impassioned prose poem .</s>

<s>slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memories .</s>

<s>the guns are fired , the hymns are sung , and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors .</s>

<s>as he had longed to be , he became the echo of a saga .</s>

<s>Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory .</s>

<s>excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of The Charles Men , and need not detain us here .</s>

<s>it is different with his volume The Swedes And Their Chieftains ( Svenskarna och deras Hovdingar ) , a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high school students .</s>

<s>admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to Swedish history for readers of other countries .</s>

<s>some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural , as suited to the legendary background .</s>

<s>these are suggestive of Selma Lagerlof .</s>

<s>especially touching is the chapter , The Little Sister , about a king's daughter who became a nun in the convent of St. Birgitta .</s>

<s>the record teems with romance and adventure .</s>

<s>Gustaf Vasa is a superb example , and Charles 10 , the conqueror of Denmark , hardly less so .</s>

<s>of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles 12 it is unnecessary to speak .</s>

<s>today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases , but his primary function remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not .</s>

<s>it is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited .</s>

<s>the mythological private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways .</s>

<s>on the one hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed .</s>

<s>as a free-lance investigator , the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client .</s>

<s>for this reason , he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure , whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine .</s>

<s>on the other hand , the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases ;
no client would ever think of asking him to do such things .</s>

<s>whatever his original assignment , the fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder .</s>

<s>operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name , he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves .</s>

<s>he catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished .</s>

<s>thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman .</s>

<s>he is , first and foremost , a defender of public morals , a servant of society .</s>

<s>it is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological detective .</s>

<s>by virtue of his self-reliance , his individualism and his freedom from external restraint , the private eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle class conception of liberty , which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the hindmost .</s>

<s>at the same time , because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society , because he likes to catch criminals , he is in middle class eyes a virtuous man .</s>

<s>in this way , the private detective gets the best of two possible worlds .</s>

<s>he is an individualist but not an anarchist ;
he is a public servant but not a cop .</s>

<s>in short , the fictional private eye is a specialized version of Adam Smith's ideal entrepreneur , the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere promote the public welfare .</s>

<s>in the mystery story , as in The Wealth of Nations , individualism and the social good are two sides of the same benevolent coin .</s>

<s>there is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement : Adam Smith was wrong .</s>

<s>not only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth to monopoly capitalism .</s>

<s>the rise of the giant corporations in Western Europe and the United States dates from the period 1880-1900 .</s>

<s>now , although the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far as Balzac , Dickens , and Poe , it was not until the closing decades of the 19th century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction .</s>

<s>Sherlock Holmes , the ancestor of all private eyes , was born during the 1890s .</s>

<s>thus the transformation of Adam Smith's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life .</s>

<s>driven from the marketplace by the course of history , our hero disguises himself as a private detective .</s>

<s>the birth of the myth compensates for the death of the ideal .</s>

<s>even on the fictional level , however , the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully resolved .</s>

<s>the individualism and public service of the private detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct : he enforces the law without being told to do so .</s>

<s>the private eye is therefore a moral man ;
but his morality rests upon that of his society .</s>

<s>the basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal .</s>

<s>unfortunately , this assumption does not always hold good .</s>

<s>as capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for its survival , the private detective is placed in a serious dilemma .</s>

<s>if he is good , he may not be legal ;
if he is legal , he may not be good .</s>

<s>it is the gradual unfolding and deepening of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery story .</s>

<s>with the advent of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes , the development of the modern private detective begins .</s>

<s>Sherlock Holmes is not merely an individualist ;
he is very close to being a mental case .</s>

<s>a brief list of the great detective's little idiosyncrasies would provide Dr. Freud with ample food for thought .</s>

<s>Holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing stimulants ;
he is prone to semi-catatonic trances induced by the playing of the vioiln ;
he is a recluse , an incredible egotist , a confirmed misogynist .</s>

<s>Holmes rebels against the social conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds .</s>

<s>his eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom .</s>

<s>it was in order to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that Holmes became a detective in the first place .</s>

<s>as he informs Watson , my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence .</s>

<s>these little problems help me to do so .</s>

<s>Holmes is a public servant , to be sure ;
but the society which he serves bores him to tears .</s>

<s>the curious relationship between Holmes and Scotland Yard provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric behavior .</s>

<s>although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with Scotland Yard , Holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality of the police .</s>

<s>they for their part are convinced that Holmes is too unorthodox and theoretical to make a good detective .</s>

<s>why do the police find Holmes unorthodox ?</s>

<s>on the face of it , it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police routine .</s>

<s>another , more interesting explanation , is hinted at by Watson when he observes on several occasions that Holmes would have made a magnificent criminal .</s>

<s>the great detective modestly agrees .</s>

<s>Watson's insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes and his arch-opponent , Dr. Moriarty .</s>

<s>the two men resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism , their relentlessness .</s>

<s>the first series of Sherlock Holmes adventures ends with Holmes and Moriarty grappling together on the edge of a cliff .</s>

<s>they are presumed to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace .</s>

<s>linked to Holmes even in death , Moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great detective , the image of what our hero might have become were he not a public servant .</s>

<s>just as Holmes the eccentric stands behind Holmes the detective , so Holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both .</s>

<s>in the modern English whodunnit , this insinuation of latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared .</s>

<s>Hercule Poirot and Lord Peter Whimsey ( the respective creations of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers ) have retained Holmes' egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits .</s>

<s>Poirot and his counterparts are perfectly respectable people ;
it is true that they are also extremely dull .</s>

<s>their dedication to the status quo has been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a Sherlock Holmes .</s>

<s>the latter's real descendents were unable to take root in England ;
they fled from the Victorian parlor and made their way across the stormy Atlantic .</s>

<s>in the American hardboiled detective story of the '20s and '30s , the spirit of the mad genius from Baker Street lives on .</s>

<s>like Holmes , the American private eye rejects the social conventions of his time .</s>

<s>but unlike Holmes , he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt .</s>

<s>surrounded by crime and violence everywhere , the hardboiled private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation .</s>

<s>his alienation is far more acute than Holmes' ;
he is not an eccentric but rather an outcast .</s>

<s>with Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe , alienation is represented on a purely physical plane .</s>

<s>Wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house , and spends most of his time drinking beer and playing with orchids .</s>

<s>more profound and more disturbing , however , is the moral isolation of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe .</s>

<s>in a society where everything is for sale , Marlowe is the only man who cannot be bought .</s>

<s>his tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence .</s>

<s>beaten , bruised and exhausted , he pursues the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low morals , always alone , always despised .</s>

<s>in the end , he gets his man , but no one seems to care ;
virtue is its own and only reward .</s>

<s>a similar tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of Eric Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery stories , Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon .</s>

<s>Sam Spade joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon ;
but when the bird is found at last , it turns out to be a fake .</s>

<s>now the detective must save his own skin by informing on the girl he loves , who is also the real murderer .</s>

<s>for Sam Spade , neither crime nor virtue pays ;
moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two .</s>

<s>because the private eye intends to save society in spite of himself , he invariably finds himself in trouble with the police .</s>

<s>the latter are either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care .</s>

<s>in either case , they do not appreciate the private detective's zeal .</s>

<s>Perry Mason and Hamilton Burger , Nero Wolfe and Inspector Cramer spend more time fighting each other than they do in looking for the criminal .</s>

<s>frequently enough , the police are themselves in league with the killer ;
Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest provides a classic example of this theme .</s>

<s>but even when the police are honest , they do not trust the private eye .</s>

<s>he is , like Phillip Marlowe , too alienated to be reliable .</s>

<s>finally , in the Maltese Falcon among others , the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion : Sam Spade becomes the chief murder suspect .</s>

<s>in order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal , who happens to be his girl friend .</s>

<s>what was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock Holmes now appears as a direct accusation : the private eye is in danger of turning into his opposite .</s>

<s>it is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery story which creates this fatal dilemma .</s>

<s>by upholding his own personal code of behavior , the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption .</s>

<s>that society responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo , a potential criminal .</s>

<s>if the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society .</s>

<s>he must , in short , cease to be a detective and become a rebel .</s>

<s>on the other hand , if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession , he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism .</s>

<s>Dashiell Hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write mystery stories and turning to other pursuits .</s>

<s>his successors have adopted the opposite alternative .</s>

<s>in order to save the mystery story , they have converted the private detective into an organization man .</s>

<s>the first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer .</s>

<s>at first glance , this hero seems to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors .</s>

<s>for Hammer , nothing is forbidden .</s>

<s>he kills when he pleases , takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge , jury and executioner rolled into one .</s>

<s>it will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network required , because the type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages enumerated in Table 1 .</s>

<s>great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network .</s>

<s>by monitoring , we mean some system of control over the types of information sent from the various centers .</s>

<s>as a word of caution , we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types , question , command , statement , or exclamation .</s>

<s>for example , suppose a man wearing a $200 watch , driving a 1959 Rolls Royce , stops to ask a man on the sidewalk , what time is it ?</s>

<s>this sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car .</s>

<s>if the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question , it has served as an exclamation .</s>

<s>also , since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer ) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command .</s>

<s>however , for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to Table 1 .</s>

<s>on this basis , certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes .</s>

<s>networks illustrating some special types of organization the cocktail party .</s>

<s>presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host's desire to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavors .</s>

<s>the party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another .</s>

<s>the information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air waves , and is received by the ears .</s>

<s>since the air is a continuum , the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points ( the people ) in the net .</s>

<s>as shown in Figure 1 , there is a connection for communication between every pair of points .</s>

<s>this , and other qualifications , make the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication system ever dreamed up .</s>

<s>all four types of message listed in Table 1 are permitted , although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding the commands to a minimum , while exclamations having complimentary intonations are more than customarily encouraged .</s>

<s>the completeness of the connections provide that , for J people , there are F lines of communication between the pairs , which can become a large number ( 1,225 ) for a party of fifty guests .</s>

<s>looking at the diagram , we see that F connection lines come in to each member .</s>

<s>thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal system , but there is one weakness .</s>

<s>in spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group , the F incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond comprehension if J exceeds about six .</s>

<s>the crowd consequently breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six , with a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes .</s>

<s>for the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers , then the open house system is advantageous because the honored guests are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections at the door .</s>

<s>the rural community .</s>

<s>we consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary for family subsistence .</s>

<s>we assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication is between nearest neighbors only , as shown in Figure 2 .</s>

<s>information beyond nearest neighbor is carried second- , third- , and fourth-hand as a distortable rumor .</s>

<s>in Figure 2 , the points in the network are designated by a letter accompanied by a number .</s>

<s>the numbers indicate the number of nearest neighbors .</s>

<s>it will be noted that point J has seven nearest neighbors , J and J have six , and J has only one , while the remaining points have intermediate numbers .</s>

<s>in any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors , a point like J in Figure 2 would ( other things being equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader , while J and J would house the next most important citizens .</s>

<s>a point like J gets information directly from J , but all information beyond J is indirectly relayed through J .</s>

<s>the dweller at J is last to hear about a new cure , the slowest to announce to his neighbors his urgent distresses , the one who goes the farthest to trade , and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort .</s>

<s>since the hazards of poor communication are so great , J can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes , a mine , or a sugar maple camp .</s>

<s>location theorists have given these matters much consideration .</s>

<s>military organizations .</s>

<s>the networks for military communications are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the addition of new machines of war .</s>

<s>they also furnish proof that , in modern war , message sending must be monitored .</s>

<s>without monitoring , a military hookup becomes a noisy party .</s>

<s>the need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military signaling .</s>

<s>Alexander the Great , who used runners as message carriers , did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at once .</s>

<s>as time has passed and science has progressed , the speed of military vehicles has increased , the range of missiles has been extended , the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles has been adopted , and the range and breadth of message sending has increased .</s>

<s>next to the old problem of the slowness of decision making , network structure seems to be paramount , and without monitoring no network has value .</s>

<s>on the parade ground the net may be similar to that shown in Figure 3 .</s>

<s>the monitoring is the highest and most restrictive of any organization in existence .</s>

<s>no questions , statements , or explanations are permitted -- only commands .</s>

<s>commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank .</s>

<s>the same command is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to corporal .</s>

<s>all orders originate with the officer of highest rank and terminate with action of the men in the ranks .</s>

<s>even the officer in charge , be it a captain ( for small display ) or a general , is restrained by monitoring .</s>

<s>this is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility .</s>

<s>the commands are specified by the military regulations ;
are few in number , briefly worded , all different in sound ;
and are combinable into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade ground .</s>

<s>this monitoring is necessary because , on a parade ground , everyone can hear too much , and without monitoring a confused social event would develop .</s>

<s>with troops dispersed on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground , it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication .</s>

<s>years ago this was true , but with the replacement of wires or runners by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ) , these restrictions have disappeared and now again too much is heard .</s>

<s>in contrast to cocktail parties , military organizations , even in the field , are more formal .</s>

<s>in the extreme and oversimplified example suggested in Figure 3 , the organization is more easily understood and more predictable in behavior .</s>

<s>a military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command .</s>

<s>this objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action .</s>

<s>the connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village .</s>

<s>the assumptions upon which the example shown in Figure 3 is based are : ( A ) one man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>( B ) a message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times .</s>

<s>( C ) decisions of a general kind are made by the central command .</s>

<s>and ( D ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower rank .</s>

<s>these assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and so on until there are six levels of personnel .</s>

<s>the number of people acting as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of 55,987 men .</s>

<s>this organizational network would be of no avail if there were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent .</s>

<s>of types of message listed in Table 1 , commands and statements are the only ones sent through the vertical network shown in Figure 3 .</s>

<s>a further regulation is that commands always go down , unaccompanied by statements , and statements always go up , unaccompanied by commands .</s>

<s>questions and , particularly , exclamations are usually channeled along informal , horizontal lines not indicated in Figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor .</s>

<s>it will readily be seen that in this suggested network ( not materially different from some of the networks in vogue today ) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than is usually put into practice .</s>

<s>furthermore , the network in Figure 3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics and the like are interlaced .</s>

<s>not discussed here are some military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks .</s>

<s>such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach .</s>

<s>a team for useful research .</s>

<s>this is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss , for example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the Finns in geochemistry .</s>

<s>we hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes .</s>

<s>this problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis .</s>

<s>since the difficulty of drawing the net is great , we will merely discuss it .</s>

<s>first , we realize that a pure specialist does not exist .</s>

<s>but , for practical purposes , we have people who can be considered as such .</s>

<s>for example , there are persons who are in physical science , in the field of mineralogy , trained in crystallography , who use only X-rays , applying only the powder technique of X-ray diffraction , to clay minerals only , and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating on the montmorillonites ;
or persons in the social sciences in the field of anthropology , studying the lung capacity of seven Andean Indians .</s>

<s>so we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less as he develops , as contrasted to the generalist , who knows less and less about more and more .</s>

<s>American democratic thought pointed up the relation between the Protestant movement in this country and the development of a social religion , which he called the American Democratic Faith .</s>

<s>those familiar with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 .</s>

<s>and he describes it as a balanced polarity between the notions of the free individual and what he called the fundamental law .</s>

<s>I want to say more about Gabriel's so-called fundamental law .</s>

<s>but first I want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it .</s>

<s>he points out that from the time of Jackson on through World War 1 , evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of America .</s>

<s>he terms this early enthusiasm Romantic Christianity and concludes that its similarity to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical Protestantism .</s>

<s>let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis is important to my theme .</s>

<s>he says : beside the Protestant philosophy of Progress , as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism , should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the United States to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted the beacon of democracy .</s>

<s>he specifies , in the middle period of the Nineteenth Century it was colored by Christian supernaturalism , in the Twentieth Century it was affected by naturalism .</s>

<s>but in every period it has been humanism .</s>

<s>and let me add , utopianism , also .</s>

<s>some fourteen or fifteen years ago , in an essay I called The Leader Follows -- Where ?</s>

<s>I used his polarity to illustrate what I thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call Progressivism .</s>

<s>it seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man .</s>

<s>that is to say Gabriel's fundamental law had been so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor law any more .</s>

<s>it is a weakness of Gabriel's analysis that he never seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy .</s>

<s>and with Progressivism the Religion of Humanity was replacing what Gabriel called Christian supernaturalism .</s>

<s>and the common man was developing mythic power , or charisma , on his own .</s>

<s>during the decade that followed , the common man , as that piece put it , grew uncomfortable as the Voice of God and fled from behind Saint Woodrow ( Wilson ) only to learn from Science , to his shocked relief that after all there was no God he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow -- that there was a chemical formula for him , and that too much couldn't be expected of him .</s>

<s>the socialism implicit in the slogan of the Roosevelt Revolution , freedom from want and fear , seems a far cry from the individualism of the First Amendment to the Constitution , or of the Jacksonian frontier .</s>

<s>what had happened to the common man ?</s>

<s>French Egalitarianism had had only nominal influence in this country before the days of Popularism .</s>

<s>the riotous onrush of industrialism after the War for Southern Independence and the general secular drift to the Religion of Humanity , however , prepared the way for a reception of the French Revolution's socialistic offspring of one sort of another .</s>

<s>the first of which to find important place in our federal government was the graduated income tax under Wilson .</s>

<s>moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920s , the dislocations of the Depression , the common ethos of Materialism everywhere , all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced Mike Fink and the Great Gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the Little People .</s>

<s>however , it is important to trace the philosophy of the French Revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former .</s>

<s>that John Locke's philosophy of the social contract fathered the American Revolution with its Declaration of Independence , I believe , we generally accept .</s>

<s>yet , after Rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion of the General Will , the same philosophy , it may be said , became the idea source of the French Revolution also .</s>

<s>the importance of Rousseau's twist has not always been clear to us , however .</s>

<s>this notion of the General Will gave rise to the Commune of Paris in the Revolution and later brought Napoleon to dictatorship .</s>

<s>and it is clearly argued by Lord Percy of Newcastle , in his remarkable long essay , The Heresy Of Democracy , and in a more general way by Voegelin , in his New Science Of Politics , that this same Rousseauan idea , descending through European democracy , is the source of Marx's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat .</s>

<s>this is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves in after World War 2 and our great democratic victory that brought no peace .</s>

<s>the long road that had taken liberals in this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under a Socialist State .</s>

<s>and the J existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar .</s>

<s>and by the time the war ended , liberal leadership in this country was spiritually Marxist .</s>

<s>we will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San Francisco to set up the legal framework , finally and at last , to rationalize war -- to rationalize want and fear -- out of the world : the United Nations .</s>

<s>we of the liberal-led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation .</s>

<s>then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally .</s>

<s>during the next five years the leaders of the Fair Deal reluctantly backed down from the optimistic expectations of the New Deal .</s>

<s>during the next five years liberal leaders in the United States sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of Containment -- and the bitterest irony -- enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon : the atom bomb .</s>

<s>in 1952 , it will be remembered , the G.O.P.</s>

<s>without positive program campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly .</s>

<s>all of this , I know , is recent history familiar to you .</s>

<s>but I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common man , to point up what happened to him under Eisenhower's leadership .</s>

<s>a perceptive journalist , Sam Lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates .</s>

<s>he opens his discourse , however , with a review of the Eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents , all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age .</s>

<s>the show was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny .</s>

<s>Lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue .</s>

<s>and I select this sentence as its pertinent summation : in essence the drama of his ( Eisenhower's ) Presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling -- thus far with but limited and precarious success -- to give effective voice and force to that conservatism .</s>

<s>I will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle , with its limited and precarious success , toward conservatism .</s>

<s>it has moved on various levels , it has been clamorous and confused .</s>

<s>obviously there has been no agreement on what American conservatism is , or rather , what it should be .</s>

<s>for it was neglected , not to say nascent , when the struggle began .</s>

<s>I saw a piece the other day assailing William Buckley , author of Man And God at Yale and publisher of The National Review , as no conservative at all , but an old liberal .</s>

<s>I would agree with this view .</s>

<s>but I'm not here to define conservatism .</s>

<s>what I am here to do is to report on the gyrations of the struggle -- a struggle that amounts to self-redefinition -- to see if we can predict its future course .</s>

<s>one of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election , I suppose , is that we , the majority , were dissatisfied with Eisenhower conservatism .</s>

<s>though , to be sure , we gave Kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment .</s>

<s>this is , however , symptomatic of our national malaise .</s>

<s>but before I try to diagnose it , I would offer other evidence .</s>

<s>I will mention two volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year .</s>

<s>the earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise , sponsored by Life magazine , under the title of The National Purpose .</s>

<s>the contributors to this testament were all well-known : a former Democratic candidate for President , a New Deal poet , the magazine's chief editorial writer , two newspaper columnists , head of a national broadcasting company , a popular Protestant evangelist , etc.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>what I want to point out here is that all of them are ex-liberals , or modified liberals , with perhaps one exception .</s>

<s>I suppose we might classify Billy Graham as an old liberal .</s>

<s>and I would further note that they all -- with one exception again -- sang in one key or another the same song .</s>

<s>its refrain was : let us return to the individualistic democracy of our forefathers for our salvation .</s>

<s>Adlai Stevenson expressed some reservations about this return .</s>

<s>others invoked technology and common sense .</s>

<s>only Walter Lippman envisioned the possibility of our having outlived most of what we used to regard as the program of our national purposes .</s>

<s>but the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth of socialism was conspicuously absent .</s>

<s>the second specific comment was the report of Eisenhower's Commission on National Goals , titled Goals For Americans .</s>

<s>they , perhaps , gave the pitch of their position in the preface where it was said that Eisenhower requested that the Commission be administered by the American Assembly of Columbia University , because it was non-partisan .</s>

<s>the Commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what I would call the unconscious liberal , but not unconscious enough , to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism .</s>

<s>and here again we hear the same refrain mentioned above : the paramount goal of the United States set long ago was to guard the rights of the individual , ensure his development , enlarge his opportunity .</s>

<s>this group is secularist and their program tends to be technological .</s>

<s>but it is the need to undertake these testaments that I would submit here as symptom of the common man's malaise .</s>

<s>and let me add Murray's new book as another symptom of it , particularly so in view of the attention Time magazine gave it when it came out recently .</s>

<s>Father Murray goes back to the Declaration of Independence , too , though I may add , with considerably more historical perception .</s>

<s>I will reserve discussion of it for a moment , however , to return to President Kennedy .</s>

<s>as symptomatic of the common man's malaise , he is most significant : a liberal and a Catholic , elected by the skin of his teeth .</s>

<s>does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy , not to say confused , state of the public mind ?</s>

<s>what is the common man's complaint ?</s>

<s>let's take a panoramic look back over the course we have come .</s>

<s>has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under Eisenhower ?</s>

<s>and the basic character of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic .</s>

<s>Ralph Gabriel gave it the name of Protestant philosophy of Progress .</s>

<s>but there's a subjective side to that utopian outlook .</s>

<s>does our society have a runaway , uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ?</s>

<s>here there may be an analogy with cancer : we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth .</s>

<s>should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ?</s>

<s>noting such evidence is the first step ;
and almost the only cure is early detection and removal .</s>

<s>one way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our society's organs to see if their functioning is as healthy as before .</s>

<s>so an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation .</s>

<s>in any event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a virus infection , the disease , we shall find , is political , economical , social , and even medical .</s>

<s>have not our physical abilities already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now living ?</s>

<s>hence the prime issue , as I see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature .</s>

<s>we are already committed to establishing man's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social-political-economical context we are fond of today .</s>

<s>otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate .</s>

<s>we have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else .</s>

<s>we must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ?</s>

<s>so in these pages the term technology is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man's control over himself and over other men .</s>

<s>naturally this includes all communication forms , e.g.</s>

<s>languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control .</s>

<s>properly mindful of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world , we must employ these resources without war or violent revolution .</s>

<s>if we were creating a wholly new society , we could insist that our social , political , economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than hamper man ;
best growth .</s>

<s>but we cannot start off with a clean slate .</s>

<s>so we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to the effect of each on man's major needs .</s>

<s>asked which institution most needs correction , I would say the corporation as it exists in America today .</s>

<s>at first glance this appears strange : of all people , was not America founded by rugged individualists who established a new way of life still inspiring undeveloped societies abroad ?</s>

<s>but hear Harrison E. Salisbury , former Moscow correspondent of The New York Times , and author of To Moscow -- And Beyond .</s>

<s>in a book review of The Soviet Cultural Offensive , he says , long before the State Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West Contacts Staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of Porgy And Bess overrode the State Department to carry the contemporary cultural warfare behind the enemy lines .</s>

<s>they were not diplomats or jazz musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry Ford , Hugh Cooper , Thomas Campbell , the International Harvester Co. , and David W. Griffith .</s>

<s>their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies .</s>

<s>this favorable image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti-American propaganda corporations now outmoded .</s>

<s>perhaps the public's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the rugged capitalist entrepreneur no more exists in America .</s>

<s>in his stead is a milquetoast version known as the corporation .</s>

<s>but even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America , foreigners can ;
and our loss of prestige abroad is the direct result .</s>

<s>no amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts .</s>

<s>if we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it .</s>

<s>first , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per se cannot take economic leadership .</s>

<s>businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind .</s>

<s>when we forced individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term pseudo-capitalism and so took a major step toward socialism .</s>

<s>the biggest loss , of course , was the individual's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy .</s>

<s>socialism , I grant , has a definite place in our society .</s>

<s>but let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic .</s>

<s>some forms of capitalism do indeed work -- superb organizations , a credit to any society .</s>

<s>but the pseudo-capitalism which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics and social life , will not stand close scrutiny .</s>

<s>its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham .</s>

<s>it serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that .</s>

<s>as a creative enterprise , its abilities are primarily in swallowing creative enterprises developed outside its own organization ( an ability made possible by us , and almost mandatory ) .</s>

<s>as to benefits to employees , it is notorious for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services .</s>

<s>the corporation in America is in reality our form of socialism , vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy .</s>

<s>but while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole .</s>

<s>so we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation's needs for survival .</s>

<s>the corporation has a limited , specific place in our society .</s>

<s>ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society .</s>

<s>examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form , e.g.</s>

<s>constructing major airports or dams .</s>

<s>thus , if corporations are not to run away with us , they must become quasi-governmental institutions , subject to public control and needs .</s>

<s>in all other areas , private initiative of the proprietorship type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services .</s>

<s>proprietorship avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ;
and for this human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests .</s>

<s>such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot .</s>

<s>it can project long-range goals for itself .</s>

<s>corporations react violently to short-range stimuli , e.g.</s>

<s>, quarterly and annual dividend reports .</s>

<s>proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control ;
corporations , being more amorphous , cannot .</s>

<s>proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity , representing a human personality , and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community .</s>

<s>corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public .</s>

<s>the proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board of directors and stockholders .</s>

<s>leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop .</s>

<s>men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now .</s>

<s>hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest .</s>

<s>proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations , e.g.</s>

<s>the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth .</s>

<s>corporations should pay added taxes , to be used for educational purposes ( not necessarily of the formal type ) .</s>

<s>the right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated .</s>

<s>to perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to the fore , and is basically anti-democratic .</s>

<s>when the proprietor dies , the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it .</s>

<s>strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely interdependent , as they are each a part of the whole .</s>

<s>strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship .</s>

<s>certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so .</s>

<s>if we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ?</s>

<s>one kind of proprietorship these proposals would go far toward creating the economic atmosphere favoring growth of the individual , who , in turn , would help us to cope with runaway technology .</s>

<s>individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition .</s>

<s>the battle is not easy .</s>

<s>we are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leaders .</s>

<s>persons developed in today's corporations cannot hope to serve here -- a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside .</s>

<s>in my own company , in effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , I have been able to do many things for my employees which normal corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do .</s>

<s>also , I am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , I would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow-employees .</s>

<s>any abilities I may have were achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the growth and control of my business , coupled with raising my family .</s>

<s>this combined experience , on a foundation of very average , I assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against .</s>

<s>perhaps a list of some of the practices of my company will help here .</s>

<s>the company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles .</s>

<s>from an initial investment of $1,200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital investment , to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $10,000,000 ( we don't disclose financial figures to the public ) .</s>

<s>its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth ;
and no limitation is in evidence .</s>

<s>our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance in just a few years time , despite substantial , well established competition .</s>

<s>during the last years of Woodrow Wilson's administration , a red scare developed in our country .</s>

<s>many Americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of Russia and turned to the repression of ideas by force .</s>

<s>Postmaster General Burleson set about to protect the American people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails .</s>

<s>Attorney General Palmer made a series of raids that sent more than 4,000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights .</s>

<s>then , not many years later , the Un-American Activities Committee , under the leadership of Martin Dies , pilloried hundreds of decent , patriotic citizens .</s>

<s>anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government .</s>

<s>this hysteria reached its height under the leadership of Senator Joseph McCarthy .</s>

<s>demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notions .</s>

<s>new ideas were dangerous and must be repressed , no matter how .</s>

<s>those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency .</s>

<s>they give strict interpretation to William James' statement that every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself .</s>

<s>they seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new .</s>

<s>hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion , unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe .</s>

<s>despite this danger , however , we are informed on every hand that ideas , not machines , are our finest tools ;
they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded on a ledger page ;
they are the most valuable of commodities -- and the most salable , for their demand far exceeds supply .</s>

<s>so all-important are ideas , we are told , that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes : those who invent new ideas of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others .</s>

<s>seemingly , with an unrestricted flow of ideas , all will be well , and we are even assured that an idea a day will keep the sheriff away .</s>

<s>that , however , may also bring the police , if the thinking does not meet with social approval .</s>

<s>criminals , as well as model citizens , exercise their minds .</s>

<s>merely having a mental image of some sort is not the all-important consideration .</s>

<s>of course , there must be clarity : a single distinct impression is more valuable than many fuzzy ones .</s>

<s>but clarity is not enough .</s>

<s>the writer took a class of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in St. Joseph , Missouri .</s>

<s>an inmate , a former university professor , expounded to us , logically and clearly , that someone was pilfering his thoughts .</s>

<s>he appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities that justice might be done .</s>

<s>despite the clarity of his presentation , his idea was not of Einsteinian calibre .</s>

<s>true , ideas are important , perhaps life's most precious treasures .</s>

<s>but have we not gone overboard in stressing their significance ?</s>

<s>have we not actually developed idea worship ?</s>

<s>ideas we must have , and we seek them everywhere .</s>

<s>we scour literature for them ;
here we find stored the wisdom of great minds .</s>

<s>but are all these works worthy of consideration ?</s>

<s>can they stand rigid scrutiny ?</s>

<s>Shakespeare's wit and wisdom , his profound insight into human nature , have stood the test of centuries .</s>

<s>but was he infallible in all things ?</s>

<s>what of his treatment of the Jew in The Merchant Of Venice ?</s>

<s>Shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of Shylock , but probably he never saw a Jew , unless in some of his travels .</s>

<s>the Jews had been banished from England in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655 , when Shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years .</s>

<s>if any had escaped expulsion by hiding , they certainly would not frequent the market-place .</s>

<s>Shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays , but borrowed them from old stories , ballads , and plays , wove them together , and then breathed into them his spark of life .</s>

<s>rather than from a first-hand study of Jewish people , his delineation of Shylock stems from a collection of Italian stories , Il Pecorone , published in 1558 , although written almost two centuries earlier .</s>

<s>he could learn at second hand from books , but could not thus capture the real Jewish spirit .</s>

<s>Harris J. Griston , in Shaking The Dust From Shakespeare ( 216 ) , writes : there is not a word spoken by Shylock which one would expect from a real Jew .</s>

<s>he took the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone .</s>

<s>the Jew was the safest victim .</s>

<s>no Jew was on hand to boycott his financially struggling theater .</s>

<s>it would have been unwise policy , for instance , to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman .</s>

<s>just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of Mars , or even of Tikopia , and no senatorial investigation will result .</s>

<s>who cares about them ]
Shakespeare does not tell us that Shylock was an aberrant individual .</s>

<s>he sets him forth as being typical of the group .</s>

<s>he tells of his Jewish heart -- not a Shylockian heart ;
but a Jewish heart .</s>

<s>this would make anyone crafty and cruel , capable of fiendish revenge .</s>

<s>there is no justification for such misrepresentation .</s>

<s>if living Jews were unavailable for study , the Bible was at hand .</s>

<s>reading the Old Testament would have shown the dramatist that the ideas attributed to Shylock were abhorrent to the Jews .</s>

<s>are we better off for having Shakespeare's idea of Shylock ?</s>

<s>studying The Merchant Of Venice in high school and college has given many young people their notions about Jews .</s>

<s>does this help the non-Jew to understand this group ?</s>

<s>Thomas De Torquemada , Inquisitor-General of the Spanish Inquisition , put many persons to death .</s>

<s>his name became synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty .</s>

<s>would we gain by keeping alive his memory and besmirching today's Roman Catholics by saying he had a Catholic heart ?</s>

<s>let his bones and his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong ;
he is out of place in our times .</s>

<s>Shakespeare's Shylock , too , is of dubious value in the modern world .</s>

<s>ideas , in and of themselves , are not necessarily the greatest good .</s>

<s>a successful businessman recently prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all economists should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where they and their theories might rot together .</s>

<s>will his words come to be treasured and quoted through the years ?</s>

<s>frequently we are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted and in the end only the good ones will survive .</s>

<s>but is that not like going to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pouring out liquids and powders from an array of bottles and then , after stirring , expecting a new wonder drug inevitably to result ?</s>

<s>what of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion ?</s>

<s>is there some magic in it that assures results ?</s>

<s>when Peter B. Kyne ( Pride Of Palomar , 43 ) informed us in 1921 that we had an instinctive dislike for the Japanese , did the heated debates of the Californians settle the truth or falsity of the proposition ?</s>

<s>The Leopard's Spots came from the pen of Thomas Dixon in 1902 , and in this he announced an unchangeable law .</s>

<s>if a child had a single drop of Negro blood , he would revert to the ancestral line which , except as slaves under a superior race , had not made one step of progress in 3,000 years .</s>

<s>that doctrine has been accepted by many , but has it produced good results ?</s>

<s>in the same vein , a certain short-story plot has been overworked .</s>

<s>the son and heir of a prominent family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of her finger nails .</s>

<s>in time she presents her aristocratic husband with a coal-black child .</s>

<s>is the world better for having this idea thrust upon it ?</s>

<s>will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity ?</s>

<s>for answers to such questions we must turn to the anthropologists , the biologists , the historians , the psychologists , and the sociologists .</s>

<s>long ago they consigned the notions of Kyne and Dixon to the scrap heap .</s>

<s>false ideas surfeit another sector of our life .</s>

<s>for several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship .</s>

<s>the stepmother , almost without exception , has been presented as a cruel ogress .</s>

<s>children , conditioned by this mistaken notion , have feared stepmothers , while adults , by their antagonistic attitudes , have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one .</s>

<s>debate is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild a happier one .</s>

<s>research , on the other hand , has shown many stepmothers to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers .</s>

<s>Helen Deutsch informed us ( The Psychology Of Women , Vol.</s>

<s>2 , 434 ) that in all cultures the term stepmother automatically evokes deprecatory implications , a conclusion accepted by many .</s>

<s>will mere debate on that proposition , even though it be free and untrammeled , remove the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ?</s>

<s>that is questionable , to say the least .</s>

<s>research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one .</s>

<s>most assuredly ideas are invaluable .</s>

<s>but ideas , just for the sake of having them , are not enough .</s>

<s>in the 1930's , cures for the depression literally flooded Washington .</s>

<s>for a time the President received hundreds of them every day , most of them worthless .</s>

<s>ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and debate .</s>

<s>when some question arises in the medical field concerning cancer , for instance , we do not turn to free and open discussion as in a political campaign .</s>

<s>we have recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist in the laboratory .</s>

<s>the merits of the Salk anti-polio vaccine were not established on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorials , but in the laboratory and by tests in the field on thousands of children .</s>

<s>our presidential campaigns provide much debate and argument .</s>

<s>but is the result new barnsful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence solve our domestic and international problems ?</s>

<s>man , we are told , is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from bad .</s>

<s>but what a super-Herculean task it is to winnow anything of value from the mud-beplastered arguments used so freely , particularly since such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes , in themselves declarations of intellectual bankruptcy .</s>

<s>we are reminded , however , that freedom of thought and discussion , the unfettered exchange of ideas , is basic under our form of government .</s>

<s>assuredly in our political campaigns there is freedom to think , to examine any and all issues , and to speak without restraint .</s>

<s>no holds are barred .</s>

<s>but have the results been heartening ?</s>

<s>may we state with confidence that in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security ?</s>

<s>we must not forget , to be sure , that free discussion and debate have produced beneficial results .</s>

<s>in truth , we can say that this broke the power of Senator Joseph McCarthy , who was finally exposed in full light to the American people .</s>

<s>if he had been liquidated in some way , he would have become a martyr , a rallying point for people who shared his ideas .</s>

<s>debate in the political arena can be productive of good .</s>

<s>but it is a clumsy and wasteful process : it can produce negative results but not much that is positive .</s>

<s>debate rid us of McCarthy but did not give us much that is positive .</s>

<s>it did something to clear the ground , but it erected no striking new structure ;
it did not even provide the architect's plan for anything new .</s>

<s>in the field of the natural sciences , scientifically verified data are quite readily available and any discussion can be shortened with good results .</s>

<s>in the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage .</s>

<s>by no means would we discourage the production of ideas : they provide raw materials with which to work ;
they provide stimulations that lead to further production .</s>

<s>we would establish no censorship .</s>

<s>the President's personality would have opened that office to him .</s>

<s>and for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been liable to the charge that he had attempted to make it a successorship by inheritance .</s>

<s>it is testimony to the deep respect in which Mr. Eisenhower was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not explicitly to be broached .</s>

<s>these began to be apparent in a press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting specialists might clarify the President's condition for the nation .</s>

<s>and if Howard Rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate the ethics of the medical profession , his article in the Atlantic Monthly accomplished a good deal more .</s>

<s>it forced us to fix the responsibility for the position in which all medical commentators had been placed .</s>

<s>the discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective the President's decision will finally clarify itself as a moral , rather than a medical , problem .</s>

<s>because the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the President , rather than with his doctors , nothing raises more surely for us the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems under political pressure .</s>

<s>for the President had dealt with the matter humbly , in what he conceived as the democratic way .</s>

<s>but the problem is one which gives us the measure of a man , rather than a group of men , whether a group of doctors , a group of party members assembled at a dinner to give their opinion , or the masses of the voters .</s>

<s>any attempt to reconcile this statement of the central issue in the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive it as the central issue will at least resolve our confusions about the chaotic and misleading results of the earnestness of both doctors and President in a situation which should never have arisen .</s>

<s>it was a response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition which resulted in attempts at prediction .</s>

<s>in no other situation would a group of doctors , struggling competently to improve the life expectancy of a man beloved by the world , be subjected to such merciless and persistent questioning , and before they were prepared to demonstrate the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind the problems it faces .</s>

<s>and though we can look back now and see their errors , we can look back also to the ultimate error .</s>

<s>it recurred in the press conferences : the President's remarks about his running developed a singular tone , one which we find in few statements made by public individuals on such a matter .</s>

<s>the press conference became a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking , rather than his convictions .</s>

<s>he commented -- thoughtfully , a reporter told us -- that it was not too important for the individual how he ends up .</s>

<s>he gave us a simile to explain his admission that even at the worst period of his second illness it never occurred to him there was any renewed question about his running : as in the Battle of the Bulge , he had no fears about the outcome until he read the American newspapers .</s>

<s>yet the attitude that the fate of the Presidency demands in such a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed with battles to be fought , regardless of the consequences .</s>

<s>in this case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears .</s>

<s>the Presidency demands an incisive awareness of the larger implications of the death of any incumbent .</s>

<s>it is of the utmost importance to the people of America and of the world how their governing President ends up during the four years of his term .</s>

<s>only when that term is ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom and the courage to discount the dangers of his death .</s>

<s>ironically enough , in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury .</s>

<s>at the national and international level , then , what is the highest kind of morality for the private citizen represents an instance of political immorality .</s>

<s>and we had the uneasy sense that the cleavage between the moral and the political progressed amid the events which concern us .</s>

<s>for the tone of the editorials which greeted Mr. Eisenhower's original announcement of his running had been strangely disquieting .</s>

<s>neither the vibrant enthusiasm which bespeaks a people's intuitive sense of the fitness of things at climactic moments nor the vital argumentation betraying its sense that something significant has transpired was in evidence .</s>

<s>nothing testifies more clearly to that cleavage than the peculiar editorial page appearing in a July issue of Life Magazine , the issue which also carried the second announcement of the candidacy .</s>

<s>the double editorial on Two Aspects Of The U.S.</s>

<s>Spirit was subtly calculated to suggest a moral sanction for gambles great as well as small , reflecting popular approval of this questionable attitude toward the highest office in the land .</s>

<s>The Moral Creed and The Will To Risk live happily together , if we do not examine where the line is to be drawn .</s>

<s>I may possibly be a greater risk than is the normal person of my age , the President had said on February 29th of the election year , ignoring the fact that no one of his age had ever lived out another term .</s>

<s>my doctors assure me that this increased percentage of risk is not great .</s>

<s>but by the time the risk was doubled , events had dismissed from his mind both increased percentages and a previously stated intention of considering carefully anything more serious than a bout of influenza .</s>

<s>only infrequently did the situation color his thinking .</s>

<s>ironically no president we have had would have regretted more than President Eisenhower the possibility to which his own words , in the press conference held at the beginning of August , testified : that unable as he was himself to say his running was best for the country , unconsciously he had placed his party before his nation .</s>

<s>so it is that we relive his opening statement in the first television address with the dramatic immediacy of the present .</s>

<s>no consideration of risk urges itself upon him now : for this is what the mind does with the ideas on which it has not properly focussed .</s>

<s>yet with a mind less shallow , if less sharp , than some of the fortune-happy syndicates which back him , he feels what he cannot formulate ;
and we watch him amid the overtones which suggest he could never in any conscience urge a risk upon the voters .</s>

<s>moving as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of him , he adopts a position that is morally indefensible .</s>

<s>he ascribes to the mercy of God the peace which this personal matter -- the assurance that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do -- has brought him .</s>

<s>what is simply an opinion formed in defiance of the laws of human probability , whether or not it is later confirmed , has become by September of the election year a firm conviction .</s>

<s>as a means of silencing a discussion which ought to have taken place , the statement is an effective one : we sympathize with the universal confusion which gives rise to such convictions .</s>

<s>but it is also the climax to one of the absorbing chapters in our current political history .</s>

<s>in assigning to God the responsibility which he learned could not rest with his doctors , Eisenhower gave evidence of that weakening of the moral intuition which was to characterize his administration in the years to follow .</s>

<s>in any other man this reassurance to the electorate would have caused us a profound moral shock .</s>

<s>about this man we had to think twice .</s>

<s>we knew that it was , as reassurance , the ironic fruit of a deeply moral nature .</s>

<s>but the fact remains that even the unconscious acceptance of himself as a man of destiny divinely protected must be censored in any man who evades the responsibility for his major decisions , and thus for imposing his will on the people .</s>

<s>and in the context of drifting personal utterances we have examined , there was occasional evidence of the origin of all such evasions .</s>

<s>when the possibility that he had not given reconsideration to so weighty a decision seemed to disconcert his questioners , Mr. Eisenhower was known to make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going to talk about the matter any more .</s>

<s>thinking had stopped ;
it was not to be resumed .</s>

<s>the portrait that had developed , fragmentarily but consistently , was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking is alien enough that the making of a decision inhibits , when it does not forestall , any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence .</s>

<s>this does not mean that the decision to run for office should inevitably have been revoked .</s>

<s>instead it means that the thinking in which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the decision , as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative attention to the constitutional problems the decision had uncovered might have done .</s>

<s>drifting through a third illness , apparently without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency other than a talk with the vice-president , Eisenhower revealed the singularly static quality of his thinking .</s>

<s>despite three warnings , no sense of moral urgency impelled him to distinguish his situation , and thus his responsibilities , from Wilson's .</s>

<s>by contrast , the energetic reaction of the leader to the full demands his decision imposes upon him strengthens the moral intuition and gives us the measure of the man .</s>

<s>only by means of an intensive preoccupation with the detailed considerations following from any decision can he ensure attention to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of immorality in the major decision are effectively to be checked .</s>

<s>in the incessant struggle with recalcitrant political fact he learns to focus the essence of a problem in the significant detail , and to articulate the distinctions which clarify the detail as significant , with what is sometimes astounding rapidity .</s>

<s>like Lincoln , he can distinguish his relation to God from the constitutional responsibilities a questionable decision exacts of him .</s>

<s>like Roosevelt , he can distinguish an attitude toward a Russian leader he may share with a host of Americans from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may impose upon him .</s>

<s>he chooses to subordinate one to the other , sometimes reluctantly , accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed .</s>

<s>the very nature of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact leads to the valid convictions which become force of will in the manifest leader .</s>

<s>the capacity for making the distinctions of which diplomacy is compact , and the facility with language which can render them into validity in the eyes of other men are the leader's means for transforming the moral intuition into moral leadership .</s>

<s>the making of distinctions , like the perception of the great distinctions made , is an inordinately difficult business .</s>

<s>Lincoln's slow progress towards the several marking his achievement is even now unrecognizable as such , and loosely interpreted as the alternation of inconsistency with vision .</s>

<s>but because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other by means of the capacities with which words endow it , we do not unwisely examine the type of distinction , in the sphere of politics , on which decisions hang .</s>

<s>only recently , and perhaps because a television debate can so effectively dramatize President Kennedy's extraordinary mastery of detail , have the abilities on which the capacity for making distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of politics .</s>

<s>in his recent evaluation of Kennedy's potentialities for leadership , Walter Lippmann has cited the precision of his mind , his immense command of factual detail , and his instinct for the crucial point as impressive in the extreme ;
and it is surely clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the individual's command of language interacts with the other two .</s>

<s>for this change is not a change from one positive position to another , but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation .</s>

<s>the liberal-conservative division , we might observe in passing , is not of itself directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle between ruling groups .</s>

<s>rather it is rooted in a difference of response to the threat of social disintegration .</s>

<s>the division is not between those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change .</s>

<s>rather it is a division established by two absolutely different ways of thought with regard to man's life in society .</s>

<s>these ways are absolutely irreconcilable because they offer two different recipes for man's redemption from chaos .</s>

<s>the civilizational crisis , the third type of change raises the question what are we to do ?</s>

<s>on the most primitive level .</s>

<s>for the answer cannot be derived from any socially cohesive element in the disrupting community .</s>

<s>there is no socially existential answer to the question .</s>

<s>for the truth formerly experienced by the community no longer has existential status in the community , nor does any answer elaborated by philosophers or theoriticians .</s>

<s>in this phase of change , no idea has social acceptance and so none has ontological status in the community .</s>

<s>an interregnum ensues in which not men but ideas compete for existence .</s>

<s>if we examine the three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure we find an additional profound difference between the third and the first two , one that accounts for the notable difference between the responses they evoke .</s>

<s>the first two types of change occur within the inward and immanent structure of the society .</s>

<s>the first involves a simple shift of interests in the society .</s>

<s>the second involves something deeper , but its characteristic form focuses on a shift in policy for the community , not in the truth on which the community rests .</s>

<s>thus in both types attention is focused on the community itself , and its phenomenological life .</s>

<s>the third type , however , wrenches attention from the life of action and interests in the community and focuses it on the ground of being on which the community depends for its existence .</s>

<s>Voegelin has analyzed this experience in the case of the stable , healthy community .</s>

<s>there the community , faced with the need to formulate policy on the level of absolute justice , can find the answer to its problem in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced .</s>

<s>this , however , cannot be done by a community whose very experience of truth is confused and incoherent : it has no absolute standard , and consequently cannot distinguish the absolute from the contingent .</s>

<s>it has lost its ground of being and floats in a mist of appearances .</s>

<s>relativism and equality are its characteristic diseases .</s>

<s>precisely at the moment when it has lost its vision the mind of the community turns out from itself in a search for the ontological standard whereby it can measure itself .</s>

<s>for paradigmatic history breaks rather than unfolds precisely when the movement is from order to disorder , and not from one order to a new order .</s>

<s>the liberal-conservative split , to define it further , derives from a basic difference concerning the existential status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads to its identification .</s>

<s>when disruptive change has penetrated to the third level of social order , the process of disruption rapidly reaches a point of no return .</s>

<s>indeed , it is probable that this point is reached the moment the third level of change begins .</s>

<s>at that point we reach the closed historical situation : the situation in which man is no longer free to return to a status quo ante .</s>

<s>at that point men become aware of the mystery of history called variously fate , or destiny , or providence , and feel themselves caught helplessly in the writhing of a disrupted society .</s>

<s>the reasons for this experience are rooted in the metaphysical characteristics of such a change .</s>

<s>of all forms of being , society , or community , has the greatest element of determinability .</s>

<s>its ontological status is itself most tenuous because apart from individual men , who are its matter , tradition , the form of society exists only as a shared perception of truth .</s>

<s>the ontological status of society thus is constituted by the psychological status of society's members .</s>

<s>the content of that psychological status determines , ultimately , the content of civilization .</s>

<s>those social , civilizational factors not rooted in the human spirit of the group , ultimately cease to exist .</s>

<s>civilization itself -- tradition -- falls out of existence when the human spirit itself becomes confused .</s>

<s>civilization is what man has made of himself .</s>

<s>its massive contours are rooted in the simple need of man , since he is always incomplete , to complete himself .</s>

<s>it is not enough for man to be an ontological esse .</s>

<s>he needs existential completion , he needs , that is , to move in the direction of completion .</s>

<s>and the direction of that movement is determined by his perception of the truth about himself .</s>

<s>he must , consequently , exist as a self-perceived substantive , developing agent , or he does not exist as man .</s>

<s>thus , it is no mystical intuition , but an analyzable conception to say that man and his tradition can fall out of existence .</s>

<s>this happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance in himself , of a nature that , in Maritain's words , is perceived as a locus of intelligible necessities .</s>

<s>an existentialist is a man who perceives himself only as esse , as existence without substance .</s>

<s>thus human perception and human volition is the immanent cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reaches the civilizational level .</s>

<s>thus with regard to the loss of tradition , in the change from order to disorder the metaphysics of change works itself out as a disruption of the individual soul , a change in which man continues as an objective ontological existent , but no longer as a man .</s>

<s>further , change is a form of motion , it occurs as the act of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency and has not yet reached the terminus of the change .</s>

<s>with regard to the change we are examining , the question is , at what point does the change become irreversible ?</s>

<s>a number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in the process .</s>

<s>change involves the displacement of form .</s>

<s>this means that the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring the existent form in being .</s>

<s>if the existent form is to be retained new factors that reinforce it must be introduced into the situation .</s>

<s>in the case of social decay , form is displaced simply by the process of dissolution with no form at the terminus of the process .</s>

<s>now in the mere fact of the beginning of such displacement we have prima-facie evidence of the ontological weakness of the fading form .</s>

<s>and when we consider the tenuous hold tradition has on existence , any weakening of that hold constitutes a crisis of existence .</s>

<s>the retention of a tradition confronted with such a crisis necessitates the introduction of new spiritual forces into the situation .</s>

<s>however , the crisis occurs precisely as a weakening of spiritual forces .</s>

<s>it would seem , therefore , that in a civilizational crisis man cannot save himself .</s>

<s>the emergence of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a warranty for the victory of disorder .</s>

<s>and it would seem that history is a witness to this truth .</s>

<s>as a further characterization of the liberal conservative split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for escaping inevitabilities in history .</s>

<s>these differences , in turn , derive from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character of change .</s>

<s>unanalyzed responses anxiety and deep insecurity are the characteristic responses evoked by the crisis in tradition .</s>

<s>to experience them , it is not necessary for a people to be actively aware of what is happening to it .</s>

<s>the process of erosion need only undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding within the individual , while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation of processes occurs .</s>

<s>within the individual the reaction has been called various names , all , however , pointing to the same basic experience .</s>

<s>Weil identifies it as being rootless , Guardini as being placeless , Riesman as being lonely .</s>

<s>others call it alienation , and mean by that no simple economic experience ( as Marx does ) but a deep spiritual sense of dislocation .</s>

<s>within institutions there is a marked decline of the process of persuasion and the substitution of a force-fear process which masquerades as the earlier one of persuasion .</s>

<s>we note the use of rhetoric as a weapon , the manipulation of the masses by propaganda , the mobilization of effort and resources .</s>

<s>within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed responses to the experience of civilizational crisis , two basic organizations of response are observable : reaction and ideological progressivism .</s>

<s>these responses are explicable in terms of characteristics inherent in the crisis .</s>

<s>both are predictably destined to fail .</s>

<s>the response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing .</s>

<s>its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through the repression of disruptive forces .</s>

<s>to this end political authority is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive powers .</s>

<s>the implicit assumption of this response is that history is reversible .</s>

<s>seemingly , order is perceived as a kind of subsistent entity now covered by adventitious accretions .</s>

<s>the problem is to remove the accretions and thereby uncover the order that was always there .</s>

<s>such a response , of course , misses the point that in crisis order is going out of existence .</s>

<s>moreover its posture of stubborn but simple resistance is doomed to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the existent form of order , once the activation of change has reached visible proportions .</s>

<s>the most reaction can achieve is stasis , and a stasis that can be maintained only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhausts itself .</s>

<s>despite the hopelessness of the response , it is explicable in terms of the crisis of tradition itself .</s>

<s>since a civilizational crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling class , reaction is normally found among those who feel themselves to be among the ruling class .</s>

<s>their great error is to mingle the responses typical of each of the three types of change .</s>

<s>since civilizational change is the most difficult to perceive and analyze , it seldom is given adequate attention .</s>

<s>and the anxiety it generates is misinterpreted as anxiety over private interest and threatened social status .</s>

<s>the basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in its realistic assumption of the primacy of the real over the ideational .</s>

<s>but this truth is distorted by its extreme application : the assumption of the separate existence of tradition .</s>

<s>the reactionary misses the point that tradition exists ontologically only in the form of psychological-intellectual relations .</s>

<s>reactionary theories , for this reason , usually assume some form of organismic theory .</s>

<s>in its defensive formulations , the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds of the independent existence of the community .</s>

<s>in its dynamic form , it visualizes the community as the embodiment of an ontological force -- the race , for instance , which unfolds in history .</s>

<s>in both cases the individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality .</s>

<s>when the reactionary response is thus bolstered by an intellectual defense , the characteristics of that defense are explicable only in terms of the basic attitudes of unanalyzed reaction .</s>

<s>reaction is rooted in a perception of tradition as a whole .</s>

<s>it is a total situation that is defended : the good old days .</s>

<s>there is no selectivity ;
even the questionable features of the past are defended .</s>

<s>the point is that the reactionary , for whatever motive , perceives himself to have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself , something which , consequently , he was not able to accept or reject on the basis of subjective preference .</s>

<s>the reactionary is confused about the existential status of a decaying tradition , but he does perceive the unity tradition had when it was healthy .</s>

<s>all of which brings up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic insight in a literary work .</s>

<s>is the Oedipus complex , the clinical syndrome , material for a tragedy ?</s>

<s>if we remove ourselves for a moment from our time and our infatuation with mental disease , isn't there something absurd about a hero in a novel who is defeated by his infantile neurosis ?</s>

<s>I am not making a clinical judgment here , for such personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst's consulting room , but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies than tragedy in life .</s>

<s>a man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat his earliest failure in love , only makes us a little weary of man ;
his tragedy seems unworthy and trivial .</s>

<s>now we can argue that the irresistible fate of Oedipus Rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longings of Oedipus projected outward , but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history .</s>

<s>we can also argue that the three brothers Karamazov and Smerdyakov were the external representatives of an internal conflict within one man , Dostoevsky , a conflict having to do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father's woman .</s>

<s>but a novel in which one man Karamazov explored the divisions within his personality would scarcely merit publication in the Psychoanalytic Quarterly .</s>

<s>it is a mistake to look upon the Oedipus of Oedipus Complex as a literary descendant of Oedipus Rex .</s>

<s>whatever the psychological truth in the Oedipus myth , an Oedipus who is drawn to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of humanity and its archaic crime , and the incest that is unknowing renews the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the secret .</s>

<s>but a modern Oedipus who is doomed because he cannot oppose his own childhood is only pathetic , and for renouncing the mystery in favor of psychological truth he gives up the claim on our sympathies .</s>

<s>I am suggesting that a case-history approach to the Oedipus complex is a blind alley for a storyteller .</s>

<s>the best gifts of the novelist will be wasted on the reader who is insulated against any surprises the novelist may have in store for him .</s>

<s>incest is still a durable theme , but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways to surprise the emotions , and there is no better way to do this than that of concealment and symbolic representation .</s>

<s>and the best way to conceal and disguise the elements of an incest story is not to set out to write an incest story .</s>

<s>which brings to mind another Lawrence story and some interesting comparisons in the treatment of the Oedipal theme .</s>

<s>The Rocking Horse Winner is also a story about a boy's love for his mother .</s>

<s>if I now risk some comparisons with Sons And Lovers let it be clear that I am not comparing the two works or judging their merits ;
I am only singling out differences in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects .</s>

<s>The Rocking Horse Winner is a fantasy with extraordinary power to disturb the reader -- but we do not know why .</s>

<s>it is the story of the hopeless love of a little boy for his cold and vain mother .</s>

<s>there are ghostly scenes in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward the climax that will magically give him the name of the winning horse .</s>

<s>the child grows rich on his winnings and conspires with his uncle to make secret gifts of his money to his mother .</s>

<s>the story ends in the child's illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion to ride his horse to win for his mother .</s>

<s>the child dies with his mourning mother at his bedside .</s>

<s>I had read the story many times without asking myself why it affected me or caring why it did .</s>

<s>but on one occasion when I encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was my patient I began to understand the uncanny effects of this story .</s>

<s>it was , of course , a little boy's fantasy of winning his mother to himself , and replacing the father who could not give her the things she wanted -- a classical oedipal fantasy if you like -- but if it were only this the story would be banal .</s>

<s>why does the story affect us ?</s>

<s>how does the rocking exert its uncanny effect upon the reader ?</s>

<s>the rocking is actually felt in the story , a terrible and ominous rhythm that prophesies the tragedy .</s>

<s>the rocking , I realized , is the single element in the story that carries the erotic message , the unspoken and unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a child's fantasy and disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit .</s>

<s>the rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the erotic undercurrent silent and making it present ;
it conceals and yet is suggestive ;
a perfect symbol .</s>

<s>and if we understand the rocking as an erotic symbol we can also see how well it serves as the symbol of impending tragedy .</s>

<s>for this love of the boy for his mother is a hopeless and forbidden love , doomed by its nature .</s>

<s>we are also struck by the fact that this story of a boy's love for his mother does not offend , while the incestuous love of the man , Paul Morel , sometimes repels .</s>

<s>it's easy to see why .</s>

<s>this love belongs to childhood ;
we accord it its place there , and in Lawrence's treatment we are given the innocent fantasy of a child , in fact , the form in which oedipal love is expressed in childhood .</s>

<s>and when the child dies in Lawrence's story in a delirium that is somehow brought on by his mania to win and to make his mother rich , the manifest absurdity of such a disease and such a death does not enter into our thoughts at all .</s>

<s>we have so completely entered the child's fantasy that his illness and his death are the plausible and the necessary conclusion .</s>

<s>I am sure that none of the effects of this story were consciously employed by Lawrence to describe an oedipal fantasy in childhood .</s>

<s>it is most probable that Freud and the Oedipus complex never entered his head in the writing of this story .</s>

<s>he was simply writing a story that wanted to be told , and in the writing a childhood fantasy of his own emerged .</s>

<s>he would not have cared why it emerged , he only wanted to capture a memory to play with it again in his imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy .</s>

<s>in our own time we have seen that the novelist's debt to psychoanalysis has increased but that the novel itself has not profited much from this marriage .</s>

<s>Ortega's hope that modern psychology might yet bring forth a last flowering of the novel has only been partially fulfilled .</s>

<s>the young writer seems intimidated by psychological knowledge ;
he has lost confidence in his own eyes and in the validity of his own psychological insights .</s>

<s>he borrows the insights of psychology to improve his impaired vision but cannot bring to his work the distinctive vision that should be a novelist's own .</s>

<s>he has been seduced by the marvels of the unconscious and has lost interest in studying the surfaces of character .</s>

<s>if many of the characters in contemporary novels appear to be the bloodless relations of characters in a case history it is because the novelist is often forgetful today that those things that we call character manifest themselves in surface behavior , that the ego is still the executive agency of personality , and that all we know of personality must be discerned through the ego .</s>

<s>the novelist who has been badly baptized in psychoanalysis often gives us the impression that since all men must have an Oedipus complex all men must have the same faces .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>I have argued that Oedipus of the Oedipus complex has a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature .</s>

<s>but a writer who has a taste for irony and who sees incest in all its modern dimensions can let his imagination work on the disturbing joke in the incest myth , the joke that strikes right at the center of man's humanness .</s>

<s>moral dread is seen as the other face of desire , and here psychoanalysis delivers to the writer a magnificent irony and a moral problem of great complexity .</s>

<s>there is probably some significance in the fact that two of the best incest stories I have encountered in recent years are burlesques of the incest myth .</s>

<s>the ancient types are reassembled in gloom and foreboding to be irresistibly drawn to their destinies , but the myth fails before the modern truth ;
the oracle speaks false and the dream speaks true .</s>

<s>in both the farmer's tale in Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man and in Thomas Mann's The Holy Sinner , the incest hero rises above the myth by accepting the wish as motive ;
the heroic act is the casting off of pretense .</s>

<s>Thomas Mann wrote The Holy Sinner in 1951 .</s>

<s>it was conceived as a leave-taking , a kind of melancholy gathering-in of the myths of the West , bevor die Nacht sinkt , eine lange Nacht vielleicht und ein tiefes Vergessen .</s>

<s>he chose a medieval legend of incest , Gregorius Vom Stein , and freely borrowed and parodied other myths of the West , mixing themes , language , peoples and times in a master myth in which the old forms continually renew themselves , as in his previous treatment of Joseph .</s>

<s>but The Holy Sinner is not simply a retelling of old stories for an old man's entertainment .</s>

<s>Mann understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated joke he liked to tell .</s>

<s>and when he retold the legend of Gregorius he interpolated a modern version in which the medieval players speak contemporary thoughts in archaic language ;
while they move through the pageantry of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through not-knowing , they reveal the unconscious motive in seeking each other and in the last scene make an extraordinary confession of guilt in the twentieth-century manner .</s>

<s>Grigorss is the child of an incestuous union between a royal brother and sister , the twins Sibylla and Wiligis .</s>

<s>he is born in secrecy after the death of his father and cast adrift soon after birth .</s>

<s>the infant is discovered by a fisherman who brings him home to rear him .</s>

<s>an ivory tablet in the infant's cask recounts the story of his sinful origins and is preserved for the child by the monks of a monastery in the fishing village .</s>

<s>Grigorss , at seventeen , learns his story and goes forth as a knight to uncover his origins .</s>

<s>his sailing vessel is guided by fate to the shores of his own country at a time when Sibylla's domain is overrun by the armies of one of her rejected suitors .</s>

<s>Grigorss overcomes the suitor in battle , delivers the city from its oppressors and marries Sibylla who had fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him .</s>

<s>Sibylla is pregnant with their second child when she finds the ivory tablet concealed by her husband , and the identities of mother and son are revealed .</s>

<s>Grigorss goes off to do penance on a rock for seventeen years .</s>

<s>at the end of this period two pious Christians in Rome receive the revelation which leads them to seek the next Pope on the rock .</s>

<s>Grigorss comes to Rome and becomes a great and beloved Pope .</s>

<s>in the last pages of the book Sibylla comes to Rome to seek an audience with the great Pope and to give her confession .</s>

<s>mother and son recognize each other and , in Mann's version of this legend , make a remarkable confession of guilt to each other , the confession of unconscious motive and unconscious knowledge of their true identities from the time they had first set eyes on each other .</s>

<s>in recollection he has said : natural or man-made objects kept coming into my head , but I would suppress them sternly .</s>

<s>moreover , he organized the movement of his forms , within his rigorously shaped space , into highly complex equilibriums ;
and used gradations of color value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors .</s>

<s>the worthy Mondrian , seeing these pictures , said in a tone of kindly reproof : but you are really an artist of the naturalistic tradition ]
Helion did not realize it at the time , but it was true .</s>

<s>his monumental abstraction , made up of smooth , metallic non-objects acting upon each other with great tension , won Helion much acclaim during the 'thirties .</s>

<s>the play of novel lighting effects also entered into these compositions , whose controlled power and varied activity made them well worth meditating .</s>

<s>as Helion's work showed more and more nostalgia for the world of man and nature , the pure abstractionists expressed some disapproval ;
but Leger , Arp , Lipchitz and Alexander Calder , at the time , gave him their blessing .</s>

<s>his canvases nowadays bore titles frankly declaring them to be Figures In Space , or Blue Figure , or Pink Figure ;
and they had ( vaguely ) heads and feet .</s>

<s>exhibited in shows in London in 1935 , and in New York the following year , the new , more elaborated abstracts were much favored in the circles of the modernists as three-dimentional dramas of great intellectual coherence .</s>

<s>at this period the thirty-year old Helion was ranked as one of the mature leaders of the modern movement , according to Herbert Read , and in the direct line of descent from Cezanne , Seurat , Gris and Leger .</s>

<s>in America , Meyer Schapiro observed that , unlike the Mondrian school , Helion sought a return path to the fullness of nature within the framework of abstract art .</s>

<s>it is notable that at this time he was writing with admiration of Cimabue's and Poussin's way of filling space .</s>

<s>abstract art was still the right path for him ;
but , he held , instead of continuing as an art of reduction , it must grow , must make a place for the contributions of the Raphaels and Poussins as well as for those of the early cubists and Mondrian .</s>

<s>later Helion wrote of this phase : for years I built for myself a subtle instrument of relationships -- colors and forms without a name .</s>

<s>I played on it my secret songs , unexplained , passionate and peaceful .</s>

<s>but his own work was evolving further .</s>

<s>the extreme limitations he sensed in all current abstract art made that seem to him increasingly arid and cold .</s>

<s>he was engaged in constant experiments that searched for new directions .</s>

<s>where would it all lead ?</s>

<s>he himself did not know , as he said in 1935 .</s>

<s>but he was afraid of the future -- he would in fact welcome a way back to social integration , a functional art of some kind .</s>

<s>during the 1920's the Abstractionists , the German Bauhaus group of industrial designers , and the new architects all had the dream of some well ordered utopia , or welfare state , in which their neat and logical constructions might find their proper place .</s>

<s>but whereas the postwar American abstractionists seem to Helion to be determined to escape from the real world , or simply to rebel against it , the ordered abstractions which he and his associates of the 1930's were painting embodied the hope of improving things .</s>

<s>we were possessed by visions of a new civilization to come , very pure and elevated , he has said , in fact some ideal form of socialism such as we had dreamed of since the war of 1914-1918 .</s>

<s>instead of this the 1930's witnessed a tragic economic depression , the rise of Fascist dictators in Europe , the wasting Civil War in Spain .</s>

<s>very much the political man , Helion felt himself deeply affected by the increasingly pessimistic atmosphere of France and all Europe , whose foundations seemed to him more and more shaky .</s>

<s>in 1936 he decided to migrate to America .</s>

<s>the Rooseveltian America was a haven of liberalism and progress and seemed to him to constitute the last best hope for civilization .</s>

<s>Helion also hoped that America's mastery of technology and industrial efficiency would be accompanied by the production of new and beautiful art works .</s>

<s>I arrived in the United States with the idea of establishing myself there more or less permanently and finding inspiration for new compositions .</s>

<s>in New York he was well received by what was then only a small brave band of non-figurative artists , including Alexander Calder , George K. L. Morris , De Kooning , Holty and a few others .</s>

<s>after a year in a studio on Sheridan Square , having married an American girl who was a native of Virginia , Helion moved to a village in the Blue Ridge mountains , where he produced some of the most imposing of his abstract canvases .</s>

<s>the darkening world scene , at the time of the Munich Pact , continued to trouble his mind even in his remote Virginia studio .</s>

<s>fear possessed me , and the certainty of war , he has related .</s>

<s>I truly smelled blood , death , heaps of corpses everywhere .</s>

<s>in haste he labored to finish some last abstract paintings : a three-panel frieze , with a flying figure and a fallen figure ;
a Double-Figure , which went to the Chicago Art Institute , and is considered by him the most successful of his abstracts ;
and in early 1939 , a Fallen Figure of very ominous character , which concluded his abstract phase .</s>

<s>I knew I was carrying on with abstraction to its very end -- for me , he said of the two years' output in Virginia .</s>

<s>with those paintings of big constructions crashing down , he felt he could stop .</s>

<s>they were , in effect his last testament to non-objective art .</s>

<s>he had taken out first papers for American citizenship ;
but after war came to Europe , he decided to return to France , arriving there in January , 1940 .</s>

<s>I hated the war , he said , but thought I ought to go because I was , perhaps , one of those who hadn't done enough to prevent it .</s>

<s>in June , 1940 , Sergeant Helion , with a company of reserve troops waiting to go into battle , was sketching the hills south of the Loire River , when the war suddenly rolled in upon him .</s>

<s>its first apparition was a long , gloomy column of refugees riding in farm wagons , or pushing prams .</s>

<s>his company then carried out a confused retreating movement until it was surrounded by the Germans , a few days before France capitulated .</s>

<s>after a sort of death march during four days without food , Helion and his comrades were shipped by cattle-car to a labor camp at an estate farm in East Germany .</s>

<s>a year later they were removed to a Stalag in the harbor of Stettin .</s>

<s>at the time of his capture Helion had on his person a sketchbook he had bought at Woolworth's in New York .</s>

<s>when he was stripped , deloused and numbered by his guards , his much-thumbed sketchbook was seized and thrown on a pile of prisoners' goods to be confiscated .</s>

<s>it was then I knew that they were making war against Man , the individual within ]
-- who questioned things when given orders .</s>

<s>at Stettin the university-educated artist , who had studied German , was chosen to serve as interpreter and clerk in the office of the Stalag commander .</s>

<s>in secret he also acted as a member of the prisoners' Central Committee , which plotted sabotage , planned a few escapes , and maintained a hidden control over the wretched French slave-laborers .</s>

<s>in the Stalag , Helion came to know and love his comrades , most of them plain folk , who , in their extremity , showed true courage and ran great risks to help each other .</s>

<s>how much they esteemed him is shown by the fact that their underground committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped to escape .</s>

<s>in the prison camp's Black Market civilian clothes were quietly bought and forged papers were devised for him ;
during long weeks the plan for his flight was rehearsed .</s>

<s>every morning contingents of prisoners would be sent out to labor in nearby factories .</s>

<s>one evening , while a volley-ball game was being played in the yard among the prisoners remaining there , a simulated melee was staged -- just as the gates were opened to admit other prisoners returning from work .</s>

<s>as Helion wrote afterward : their sentry followed , four hands were stretched toward me by my comrades behind me .</s>

<s>Marquet held my briefcase ;
Finot held a wallet with my money and papers ;
Moineau and David held nothing but their fingers , they felt rough and kind and warm .</s>

<s>at this moment the volley-ball hit the ground .</s>

<s>Duclos ran toward Desprez with fists raised .</s>

<s>the guards all rushed up to intervene shedding his prison cloak , Helion shot through the gates , now clad in civilian garments and with the passport of a Flemish worker .</s>

<s>riding trains , hitching hikes on trucks across Germany , slipping through guarded frontiers with the help of secret guides , he eventually reached Vichy France , and , by the winter of 1943 , was back in Virginia .</s>

<s>he wrote : to escape from a prison camp required a very special state of mind ;
not only loathing of captivity , but a faith , a hope that is even stronger .</s>

<s>I left behind me brave men , whom captivity had robbed of all hope .</s>

<s>they too loved their families , longed for their villages : yet lacked the faith that drove one to dare the fearful chance of escape .</s>

<s>it was a time of revelations for him .</s>

<s>even the most rational of men , under great stress , may be transported by a new faith and behave like mystics .</s>

<s>Helion knew that he owed his freedom as much to the self-sacrifice of his fellow-men in Arbeitskommando 13 , Stettin , as to his own fierce will and love of life .</s>

<s>after that , he declared , to return to freedom was to fall to one's knees before the real world and adore it .</s>

<s>in prison he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from life , his guards , his companions in misery .</s>

<s>now all his desires centered on rediscovering and singing of the prosaic and yet beautiful world of men and objects so long barred from me by a barbed wire fence .</s>

<s>and , he added : during the many months in prison camp , all abstract images vanished from my mind .</s>

<s>before leaving for America , he happened to see his old friend Jean Arp and confided to him his new resolutions .</s>

<s>Arp protested : but it is impossible ]
everything in the way of representation has already been done by the old masters .</s>

<s>Helion , however , clung to the belief that in escaping from the Stalag I had also escaped from Abstraction .</s>

<s>while convalescing in his Virginia home he wrote a book recording his prison experiences and escape , entitled : They Shall Not Have Me published originally in ( Helion's ) English by Dutton & Co. of New York , in 1943 , the book was received by the press as a work of astonishing literary power and one of the most realistic accounts of World War 2 from the French side .</s>

<s>it was very widely read , too ;
and the author , who seemed the embodiment of France's rising spirit of resistance to her conquerors , was much complimented for his daring military action .</s>

<s>but when he showed his new figurative pictures to his artist friends of the abstract camp , they paid him no compliments and drew long faces .</s>

<s>between 1944 and 1947 Helion had a series of one-man shows -- at the Paul Rosenberg Gallery in New York and in Paris -- of his new realistic pictures .</s>

<s>they reincarnated the figures of human beings banished from his canvases since the 1920's .</s>

<s>these new pictures focussed on the familiar and commonplace objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking about as the things they missed most , hence associated with the sense of lost freedom : the cafe at the corner , the newspaper kiosk , the girls in doorways and windows along the street , the golden-crusted French bread they lacked , the cigarettes denied them .</s>

<s>one of the pictures was of a man with hat drawn over his face ceremoniously lighting a cigarette ;
others were of men doffing their hats to each other , carrying umbrellas with pomp , reading newspapers , or simply showing loaves of bread spread out .</s>

<s>important as was Mr. O'Donnell's essay , his thesis is so restricting as to deny Faulkner the stature which he obviously has .</s>

<s>he and also Mr. Cowley and Mr. Warren have fallen to the temptation which besets many of us to read into our authors -- Nathaniel Hawthorne , for example , and Herman Melville -- protests against modernism , material progress , and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs .</s>

<s>Faulkner's total works today , and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when Mr. Cowley made his comment , or in 1939 , when Mr. O'Donnell wrote his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the South .</s>

<s>if he is a traditionalist , he is an eclectic traditionalist .</s>

<s>if he condemns the recent or the present , he condemns the past with no less force .</s>

<s>if he sees the heroic in a Sartoris or a Sutpen , he sees also -- and he shows -- the blind and the mean , and he sees the Compson family disintegrating from within .</s>

<s>if the barn-burner's family produces a Flem Snopes , who personifies commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic crassness , the Compson family produces a Jason Compson 4 .</s>

<s>Faulkner is a most untraditional traditionalist .</s>

<s>others writing on Faulkner have found the phrase traditional moralist either inadequate or misleading .</s>

<s>among them are Frederick J. Hoffman , William Van O'Connor , and Mrs. Olga Vickery .</s>

<s>they have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough , I believe , in pointing out Faulkner's independence , his questioning if not indeed challenging the Southern tradition .</s>

<s>Faulkner's is not the mind of the apologist which Mr. O'Donnell implies that it is .</s>

<s>he is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions -- or possibly the regulations -- governing his tenure in the post office at Oxford , Mississippi , thirty-five years ago .</s>

<s>that is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of course , that he is steeped in them , in fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books .</s>

<s>it is to say rather , I believe , that he has brought to bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind -- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique .</s>

<s>he has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed Southern .</s>

<s>the fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less Southern , I rather think , for the South has been no more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity .</s>

<s>some of us might be inclined to argue , in fact , that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation , either mental or physical , are particularly Southern traits .</s>

<s>there is no necessity , I suppose , to assert that Mr. Faulkner is Southern .</s>

<s>it would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly Southern pedigree than that of his family .</s>

<s>and , after all , he has lived comfortably at both Oxford , Mississippi , and Charlottesville , Virginia .</s>

<s>the young William Faulkner in New Orleans in the 1920's impressed the novelist Hamilton Basso as obviously conscious of being a Southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so .</s>

<s>besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short periods , and in addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the South during the past hundred years .</s>

<s>it is more difficult with Faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge .</s>

<s>his own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the South , implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation .</s>

<s>his denials of extensive reading notwithstanding , it is no doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in Southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the South or have written about the South .</s>

<s>to believe otherwise would be unrealistic .</s>

<s>but in looking at Faulkner against his background in Mississippi and the South , it is important not to lose the broader perspective .</s>

<s>his earliest work reflected heavy influences from English and continental writers .</s>

<s>evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century , and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , Henry James and James Joyce among them .</s>

<s>his repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him .</s>

<s>my intention , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner's awareness has been confined within the borders of the South , but rather that he has looked at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook is Southern .</s>

<s>the ingredients of Faulkner's novels and stories are by no means new with him , and most of the problems he takes up have had the attention of authors before him .</s>

<s>a useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , I think , by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other Southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region .</s>

<s>the planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since John Pendleton Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature .</s>

<s>the thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the Civil War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed .</s>

<s>as they looked with nostalgia to a society which had been swept away , they were probably no more than half-conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed .</s>

<s>their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the South , even while memories of the war were still sharp .</s>

<s>the tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of Thomas Nelson Page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel So Red The Rose , by Stark Young .</s>

<s>although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have Stark Young's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society .</s>

<s>the myth of the Southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as Francis Pendleton Gaines showed forty years ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed .</s>

<s>Faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook .</s>

<s>without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner's chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil War .</s>

<s>it may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of Ellen Glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society .</s>

<s>Faulkner's low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier Southern novels dealing with plantation life .</s>

<s>they have an ancestry extending back , however , at least to 1728 , when William Byrd described the Lubberlanders he encountered in the back country of Virginia and North Carolina .</s>

<s>the chief literary antecedents of the Snopes clan appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which originated in the South and the Southwest in the three decades before the Civil War .</s>

<s>these narratives of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers , as a rule , and later found their way between book covers , though rarely into the planters' libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes of Horace , Mr. Addison , Mr. Pope , and Sir Walter Scott .</s>

<s>there is evidence to suggest , in fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them -- or to make them as indelicate as they are -- by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South .</s>

<s>William Gilmore Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him .</s>

<s>Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully .</s>

<s>Augustus Baldwin Longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four Southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character Ransy Sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him .</s>

<s>others who wrote of low characters and low life included Thomas Bangs Thorpe , creator of the Big Bear Of Arkansas and Tom Owen , the Bee-Hunter ;
Johnson Jones Hooper , whose character Simon Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem Snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will ;
and George Washington Harris , whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut Lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature .</s>

<s>it would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner's time .</s>

<s>such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long-established literary precedent .</s>

<s>such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of Longstreet and Hooper and Harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers ;
nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters .</s>

<s>one of the early humorists already mentioned , Thomas Bangs Thorpe , can be used to illustrate another point where Faulkner touches authentic Southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials .</s>

<s>Thorpe came to Louisiana from the East as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty .</s>

<s>but Thorpe saw also the hardships of pioneer existence , the cultural poverty of the frontier settlements , and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions .</s>

<s>as a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings , he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on the other an anecdote of the village of Hardscrabble , Arkansas , where no one had ever seen a piano ;
and he wrote also the masterpiece of frontier humor , The Big Bear Of Arkansas , in which earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the mysteries of nature .</s>

<s>some years ago Julian Huxley proposed to an audience made up of members of the British Association for the Advancement of Science that man's supernormal or extra-sensory faculties are ( now ) in the same case as were his mathematical faculties during the ice age .</s>

<s>as a Humanist , Dr. Huxley interests himself in the possibilities of human development , and one thing we can say about this suggestion , which comes from a leading zoologist , is that , so far as he is concerned , the scientific outlook places no rigid limitation upon the idea of future human evolution .</s>

<s>this text from Dr. Huxley is sometimes used by enthusiasts to indicate that they have the permission of the scientists to press the case for a wonderful unfoldment of psychic powers in human beings .</s>

<s>there may be a case of this sort , but it is not one we wish to argue , here .</s>

<s>even if people do , in a not far distant future , begin to read one another's minds , there will still be the question of whether what you find in another man's mind is especially worth reading -- worth more , that is , than what you can read in good books .</s>

<s>even if men eventually find themselves able to look through walls and around corners , one may question whether this will help them to live better lives .</s>

<s>there would be side-conclusions to be drawn , of course ;
such capacities are impressive evidence pointing to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts of biologists and organic evolutionists ;
but the basic puzzles of existence would still be puzzling , and we should still have to work out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article .</s>

<s>all we want from Dr. Huxley's statement is the feeling that this is an open world , in the view of the best scientific opinion , with practically no directional commitments as to what may happen next , and no important confinements with respect to what may be possible .</s>

<s>it seems quite obvious that all the really difficult tasks of human beings arise from the fact that man is not one , but many .</s>

<s>each man , that is , is both one and many .</s>

<s>he is a dreamer of the good society with a plan to put into effect , and he is an individual craftsman with something to make for himself and the people of his time .</s>

<s>he is a parent with a child to nurture , here and now , and he is an educator who worries about the children half way round the world .</s>

<s>he is a utopian with a stake in tomorrow and he is a vulnerable human made captive by the circumstances of today .</s>

<s>he can sacrifice himself for tomorrow and he can sacrifice tomorrow for himself .</s>

<s>he is a Craig's wife who agonizes about tobacco ash on the living room rug and he is a forgetful genius who goes boating with the town baker when dignitaries from the local university have come to call .</s>

<s>he is the stern guardian of the status quo who has raised the utilitarian structures of the age , and he is the revolutionary poet with a gun in his hand who writes a tragic apologetic to posterity for the men he has killed .</s>

<s>what will be the final symmetry of the good society ?</s>

<s>for what do the utopians labor ?</s>

<s>here , on a desk , is a stack of pamphlets representing the efforts of some of the best men of the day to penetrate these questions .</s>

<s>the pamphlets are about law , the corporation , forms of government , the idea of freedom , the defense of liberty , the various lethargies which overtake our major institutions , the gap between traditional social ideals and the working mechanisms that have been set in motion for their realization .</s>

<s>the thing that is notable in all these discussions is the lack of ideological ardor .</s>

<s>there is another kind of ardor , a quiet , sure devotion to the fundamental decencies of human life , but no angry utopian contentions .</s>

<s>actually , you could wish for some passion , now and then , but when you look around the world and see the little volcanos of current history which partisan social passions have wrought , you are glad that in these pamphlets there is at least some civilized calm .</s>

<s>you could also say that in these pamphlets is a relieving quality of maturity .</s>

<s>there is essential pleasantness in reading the writing of men who are not angry , who can contend without quarreling .</s>

<s>this is the good kind of sophistication , and with all our problems and crises this kind of sophistication has flowered in the United States during recent years .</s>

<s>a characteristic expression of such concern and inquiry is found in Joseph P. Lyford's Introduction To The Agreeable Autocracies , a recent paperback study of the institutions of modern democratic society .</s>

<s>Mr. Lyford gives voice to a temper that represents , we think , an achieved plateau of reflective thinking .</s>

<s>after casting about for a way of describing this spirit , we decided that it would be better to use Mr. Lyford's introduction as an illustration .</s>

<s>he begins : at one time it seemed as if the Soviet Union had done us a favor by providing a striking example of how not to behave towards other peoples and other nations .</s>

<s>as things turned out , however , we have not profited greatly from the lesson : instead of persistently following a national program of our own we have often been satisfied to be against whatever Soviet policy seemed to be at the moment .</s>

<s>such activity may or may not have irritated the Kremlin , but it has frequently condemned America to an unnatural defensiveness that has undermined our effort to give leadership to the free world .</s>

<s>the defensiveness has been exaggerated by another bad habit , our tendency to rate the goodness or badness of other nations by the extent to which they applaud the slogans we circulate about ourselves .</s>

<s>since the slogans have little application to reality and are sanctimonious to boot , the applause is faint even in areas of the world where we should expect to find the greatest affection for free government .</s>

<s>shocked at the response to our proclamations , we grow more defensive , and worse , we lose our sense of humor and proportion .</s>

<s>Mr. Nehru is subjected to stern lectures on neutralism by our Department of State , and an American President observes sourly that Sweden would be a little less neurotic if it were a little more capitalistic .</s>

<s>one thing you can say about Mr. Lyford is that he does not suffer from any insecurity as an American .</s>

<s>those who are insecure fear to be candid in self-examination .</s>

<s>only the strong look squarely at weakness .</s>

<s>the maturity in this point of view lies in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being clearly understood .</s>

<s>Mr. Lyford continues : even if the self portrait we distribute for popular consumption were accurate it would be dangerous to present it as a picture of the ideal society .</s>

<s>we would be ignoring the special circumstances of other countries .</s>

<s>the picture is the more treacherous when it misrepresents the facts of American life .</s>

<s>the discrepancy between what we commonly profess and what we practice or tolerate is great , and it does not escape the notice of others .</s>

<s>if our sincerity is granted , and it is granted , the discrepancy can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understanding gained by earnest self-examination .</s>

<s>what is more , the legends have become so sacrosanct that the very habit of self-examination or self-criticism smells of low treason , and men who practice it are defeatists and unpatriotic scoundrels .</s>

<s>although we continue to pay our conversational devotions to free private enterprise , individual initiative , the democratic way , government of the people , competition of the marketplace , etc.</s>

<s>, we live rather comfortably in a society in which economic competition is diminishing in large areas , bureaucracy is corroding representative government , technology is weakening the citizen's confidence in his own power to make decisions , and the threat of war is driving him economically and physically into the ground .</s>

<s>the interesting thing about Mr. Lyford's approach , and the approach of the contributors to The Agreeable Autocracies ( Oceana Publications , 1961 ) to the situation of American civilization , is that it is concerned with comprehending the psychological relationships which are having a decisive effect on American life .</s>

<s>in an ideological argument , the participants tend to thump the table .</s>

<s>they are determined to prove something .</s>

<s>the new spirit , so well illustrated by Mr. Lyford's work , is wholly free of this anxiety .</s>

<s>the problem is rather to find out what is actually happening , and this is especially difficult for the reason that we are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present , sometimes by the very agencies -- our educational system , our mass media , our statesmen -- on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding of ourselves .</s>

<s>the Introduction continues : we experience a vague uneasiness about events , a suspicion that our political and economic institutions , like the genie in the bottle , have escaped confinement and that we have lost the power to recall them .</s>

<s>we feel uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation or a union or a television set , but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and what they are doing to us , we can hardly learn to control them .</s>

<s>it does not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles on The National Purpose .</s>

<s>The Agreeable Autocracies is an attempt to explore some of the institutions which both reflect and determine the character of the free society today .</s>

<s>the men who speculate on these institutions have , for the most part , come to at least one common conclusion : that many of the great enterprises and associations around which our democracy is formed are in themselves autocratic in nature , and possessed of power which can be used to frustrate the citizen who is trying to assert his individuality in the modern world .</s>

<s>these institutions which Mr. Lyford names agreeable autocracies -- where did they come from ?</s>

<s>of one thing we can be sure : they were not sketched out by the revolutionary theorists of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the free society .</s>

<s>no doubt there are historians who can explain to a great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth century .</s>

<s>going back over this ground and analyzing the composition of forces which have created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken by the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions , in Santa Barbara .</s>

<s>but however we come , finally , to explain and account for the present , the truth we are trying to expose , right now , is that the makers of constitutions and the designers of institutions find it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host of all their enterprises .</s>

<s>the host is the flowing life of the human race .</s>

<s>this life has its own currents and rhythms , its own multiple cycles and adaptations .</s>

<s>on occasion it produces extraordinary novelties .</s>

<s>should Rousseau have been able to leave room in his social theory for the advent of television , atomic energy , and J machines ?</s>

<s>how would Thomas Jefferson feel after reading Factories In The Field ?</s>

<s>they tell us , sir , that we are free , because we have in one hand a ballot , and in the other a stock certificate .</s>

<s>with these we shape our destiny and own private property , and that , sir , makes ours the best of all possible societies .</s>

<s>the reality of the situation , however , is described by Mr. Lyford : many of us may even be secretly relieved at having a plausible excuse to delegate ancient civic responsibilities to a new bureaucracy of experts .</s>

<s>thus the member of an industrial union comes to regard his officers as business agents who may proceed without interference or recall ;
the stockholder delivers his proxy ;
and the citizen narrows his political participation to the mere act of voting -- if he votes at all .</s>

<s>Copernicus did not question it , Ptolemy could not .</s>

<s>given the conceptual context within which ancient thought thrived , how could anyone have questioned this principle ?</s>

<s>the reasons for this are partly observational , partly philosophical , and reinforced by other aesthetic and cultural factors .</s>

<s>first , the observational reasons .</s>

<s>the obvious natural fact to ancient thinkers was the diurnal rotation of the heavens .</s>

<s>not only did constellations like Draco , Cepheus , and Cassiopeia spin circles around the pole , but stars which were not circumpolar rose and set at the same place on the horizon each night .</s>

<s>nor did a constellation's stars vary in brightness during the course of their nocturnal flights .</s>

<s>the conclusion -- the distances of the constellations did not vary and their paths were circular .</s>

<s>moreover , the sun's path over earth described a segment of a great circle ;
this was clear from the contour of the shadow traced by a gnomon before and after noon .</s>

<s>as early as the 6th century B.C.</s>

<s>the earth was seen to be spherical .</s>

<s>ships disappear hull-first over the horizon ;
approaching shore their masts appeared first .</s>

<s>earth , being at the center of the universe , would have the same shape as the latter ;
so , e.g.</s>

<s>did Aristotle argue , although this may not be an observational reason in favor of circularity .</s>

<s>the discoid shapes of sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape of celestial things .</s>

<s>in light of all this , one would require special reasons for saying that the paths of the heavenly bodies were other than circular .</s>

<s>why , for example , should the ancients have supposed the diurnal rotation of the heavens to be elliptical ?</s>

<s>or oviform ?</s>

<s>or angular ?</s>

<s>there were no reasons for such suppositions then .</s>

<s>this , conjoined with the considerations above , made the circular motions of heavenly bodies appear an almost directly observed fact .</s>

<s>additional philosophical considerations , advanced notably by Aristotle , supported further the circularity principle .</s>

<s>by distinguishing superlunary ( celestial ) and sublunary ( terrestrial ) existence , and reinforcing this with the four-element physics of Empedocles , Aristotle came to speak of the stars as perfect bodies , which moved in only a perfect way , viz.</s>

<s>in a perfect circle .</s>

<s>now what is perfect motion ?</s>

<s>it must , apparently , be motion without termini .</s>

<s>because motion which begins and ends at discrete places would ( e.g.</s>

<s>for Aristotle ) be incomplete .</s>

<s>circular motion , however , since it is eternal and perfectly continuous , lacks termini .</s>

<s>it is never motion towards something .</s>

<s>only imcomplete , imperfect things move towards what they lack .</s>

<s>perfect , complete entities , if they move at all , do not move towards what they lack .</s>

<s>they move only in accordance with what is in their natures .</s>

<s>thus , circular motion is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely perfect celestial existence .</s>

<s>to return now to the four-element physics , a mixture of muddy , frothy water will , when standing in a jar , separate out with earth at the bottom , water on top , and the air on top of that .</s>

<s>a candle alight in the air directs its flame and smoke upwards .</s>

<s>this gives a clue to the cosmical order of elements .</s>

<s>thus earth has fallen to the center of the universe .</s>

<s>it is covered ( partly ) with water , air is atop of that .</s>

<s>pure fire ( the stars ) is in the heavens .</s>

<s>when combined with the metaphysical notion that pure forms of this universe are best appreciated when least embodied in a material substratum , it becomes clear that while earth will be dross on a scale of material-formal ratios , celestial bodies will be of a subtle , quickened , ethereal existence , in whose embodiment pure form will be the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain subsidiary .</s>

<s>the stars constitute an order of existence different from what we encounter on earth .</s>

<s>this is clear when one distinguishes the types of motion appropriate to both regions .</s>

<s>a projectile shot up from earth returns rectlinearly to its natural place of rest .</s>

<s>but the natural condition for the heavenly bodies is neither rest , nor rectilinear motion .</s>

<s>being less encumbered by material embodiments they partake more of what is divine .</s>

<s>their motion will be eternal and perfect .</s>

<s>let us re-examine the publicized contrasts between Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomy .</s>

<s>bluntly , there never was a Ptolemaic system of astronomy .</s>

<s>Copernicus' achievement was to have invented systematic astronomy .</s>

<s>The Almagest and The Hypotheses outline Ptolemy's conception of his own task as the provision of computational tables , independent calculating devices for the prediction of future planetary perturbations .</s>

<s>indeed , in the Halma edition of Theon's presentation of The Hypotheses there is a chart setting out ( under six distinct headings ) otherwise unrelated diagrams for describing the planetary motions .</s>

<s>no attempt is made by Ptolemy to weld into a single scheme ( a-la-Aristotle ) , these independent predicting-machines .</s>

<s>they all have this in common : the earth is situated near the center of the deferent .</s>

<s>but that one should superimpose all these charts , run a pin through the common point , and then scale each planetary deferent larger and smaller ( to keep the epicycles from bumping ) , this is contrary to any intention Ptolemy ever expresses .</s>

<s>he might even suppose the planets to move at infinity .</s>

<s>Ptolemy's problem is to forecast where , against the inverted bowl of night , some particular light will be found at future times .</s>

<s>his problem concerns longitudes , latitudes , and angular velocities .</s>

<s>the distances of these points of light is a problem he cannot master , beyond crude conjectures as to the orderings of the planetary orbits viewed outward from earth .</s>

<s>but none of this has prevented scientists , philosophers , and even historians of science , from speaking of the Ptolemaic system , in contrast to the Copernican .</s>

<s>this is a mistake .</s>

<s>it is engendered by confounding the Aristotelian cosmology in The Almagest with the geocentric astronomy .</s>

<s>Ptolemy recurrently denies that he could ever explain planetary motion .</s>

<s>this is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy .</s>

<s>so when textbooks , like that of Baker set out drawings of the Ptolemaic System , complete with earth in the center and the seven heavenly bodies epicyclically arranged on their several deferents , we have nothing but a misleading 20th-century idea of what never existed historically .</s>

<s>it is the chief merit in Copernicus' work that all his planetary calculations are interdependent .</s>

<s>he cannot , e.g.</s>

<s>compute the retrograde arc traveled by Mars , without also making suppositions about the earth's own motion .</s>

<s>he cannot describe eclipses without entertaining some form of a three-body problem .</s>

<s>in Ptolemaic terms , however , eclipses and retrograde motion were phenomena simpliciter , to be explained directly as possible resultants of epicyclical combinations .</s>

<s>in a systematic astronomy , like that of Copernicus , retrogradations become part of the conceptual structure of the system ;
they are no longer a puzzling aspect of intricately variable , local planetary motions .</s>

<s>another contrast stressed when discussing Ptolemaic vs. Copernican astronomy , turns on the idea of simplicity .</s>

<s>it is often stated that Copernican astronomy is simpler than Ptolemaic .</s>

<s>some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of the former .</s>

<s>thus , Margenau remarks : a large number of unrelated epicycles was needed to explain the observations , but otherwise the ( Ptolemaic ) system served well and with quantitative precision .</s>

<s>Copernicus , by placing the sun at the center of the planetary universe , was able to reduce the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen .</s>

<s>historical records indicate that Copernicus was unaware of the fundamental aspects of his so-called revolution , unaware perhaps of its historical importance , he rested content with having produced a simpler scheme for prediction .</s>

<s>as an illustration of the principle of simplicity the heliocentric discovery has a peculiar appeal because it allows simplicity to be arithmetized ;
it involves a reduction in the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen .</s>

<s>without careful qualification this can be misleading .</s>

<s>if in any one calculation Ptolemy had had to invoke 83 epicycles all at once , while Copernicus never required more than one third this number , then ( in the sense obvious to Margenau ) Ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler than Copernican .</s>

<s>but no single planetary problem ever required of Ptolemy more than six epicycles at one time .</s>

<s>this , of course , results from the non-systematic , cellular character of Ptolemaic theory .</s>

<s>calculations within the Copernican framework always raised questions about planetary configurations .</s>

<s>these could be met only by considering the dynamical elements of several planets at one time .</s>

<s>this is more ambitious than Ptolemy is ever required to be when he faces his isolated problems .</s>

<s>thus , in no ordinary sense of simplicity is the Ptolemaic theory simpler than the Copernican .</s>

<s>the latter required juggling several elements simultaneously .</s>

<s>this was not simpler but much more difficult than exercises within Ptolemy's astronomy .</s>

<s>analogously , anyone who argues that Einstein's theory of gravitation is simpler than Newton's , must say rather more to explain how it is that the latter is mastered by student-physicists , while the former can be managed ( with difficulty ) only by accomplished experts .</s>

<s>in a sense , Einstein's theory is simpler than Newton's , and there is a corresponding sense in which Copernicus' theory is simpler than Ptolemy's .</s>

<s>but simplicity here refers to systematic simplicity .</s>

<s>the number of primitive ideas in systematically-simple theories is reduced to a minimum .</s>

<s>the Axioms to make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully , so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced rigorously back to these axioms , rules , and primitive notions .</s>

<s>this characterizes Euclid's formulation of geometry , but not Ptolemy's astronomy .</s>

<s>there are in The Almagest no rules for determining in advance whether a new epicycle will be required for dealing with abberations in lunar , solar , or planetary behavior .</s>

<s>the strongest appeal of the Copernican formulation consisted in just this : ideally , the justification for dealing with special problems in particular ways is completely set out in the basic rules of the theory .</s>

<s>the lower-level hypotheses are never ad hoc , never introduced ex post facto just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant datum .</s>

<s>Copernicus , to an extent unachieved by Ptolemy , approximated to Euclid's vision .</s>

<s>De Revolutionibus is not just a collection of facts and techniques .</s>

<s>it is an organized system of these things .</s>

<s>solving astronomical problems requires , for Copernicus , not a random search of unrelated tables , but a regular employment of the rules defining the entire discipline .</s>

<s>hence , noting the simplicity achieved in Copernicus' formulation does not provide another reason for the acceptance of De Revolutionibus , another reason beyond its systematic superiority .</s>

<s>it provides exactly the same reason .</s>

<s>1543 A.D. is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific revolution .</s>

<s>it is really the funeral day of scholastic science .</s>

<s>granted , the cosmological , philosophical , and cultural reverberations initiated by the De Revolutionibus were felt with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow .</s>

<s>but , considered within technical astronomy , a different pattern can be traced .</s>

<s>in what does the dissatisfaction of Copernicus-the-astronomer consist ?</s>

<s>what in The Almagest draws his fire ?</s>

<s>geocentricism per se ?</s>

<s>no .</s>

<s>the formal displacement of the geocentric principle far from being Copernicus' primary concern , was introduced only to resolve what seemed to him intolerable in orthodox astronomy , namely , the unphysical triplication of centric reference-points : one center from which the planet's distances were calculated , another around which planetary velocities were computed , and still a third center ( the earth ) from which the observations originated .</s>

<s>this arrangement was for Copernicus literally monstrous : with ( the Ptolemaists ) it is as though an artist were to gather the hands , feet , head and other members for his images from divers models , each part excellently drawn , but not related to a single body ;
and since they in no way match each other , the result would be a monster rather than a man .</s>

<s>Copernicus required a systematically integrated , physically intelligible astronomy .</s>

<s>his objective was , essentially , to repair those aspects of orthodox astronomy responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these ends .</s>

<s>that such deficiencies existed within Ptolemy's theory was not discovered de novo by Copernicus .</s>

<s>the critical , rigorous examinations of Nicholas of Cusa and Nicholas of Oresme provided the context ( a late medieval context ) for Nicholas Copernicus' own work .</s>

<s>the latter looked backward upon inherited deficiencies .</s>

<s>without abandoning too much , Copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically and mechanically acceptable .</s>

<s>he did not think himself to be firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution .</s>

<s>Henrietta's feeling of identity with Sara Sullam was crowned by her discovery of the coincidence that Sara's epitaph in the Jewish cemetery in Venice referred to her as the Sulamite .</s>

<s>into the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama Henrietta , as every artist delights to do , wove strands of her own intuitive insights into human nature and -- especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters as this pair -- into the relations of men and women : in their relations , she was the giver and he the receiver , nay the demander .</s>

<s>his feeling always exacted sacrifices from her .</s>

<s>one is so accustomed to think of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive , and women as submissive and yielding , that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned , and we condemn the woman as a coquette .</s>

<s>the very firmness of her convictions and logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts ;
usually , this is most exasperating to men , who expect every woman to verify their preconceived notions concerning her sex , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly .</s>

<s>she had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in argument over a man .</s>

<s>women themselves have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside world , and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will , even when their affections are withheld .</s>

<s>she was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done .</s>

<s>one who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger .</s>

<s>in any case but the last , such a course is sure to avenge itself upon the individual ;
the moral powers no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstraining .</s>

<s>and , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding nature .</s>

<s>Henrietta was discovering in the process of writing , as the born writer does , not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the creative powers of observation , insight and intuition .</s>

<s>Dr. Isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of Sara Sullam that he considered submitting it to the Century Magazine or Harper's but he decided that its Jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it The Messenger , so our readers will be benefited instead .</s>

<s>under her father's influence it did not occur to Henrietta that she might write on subjects outside the Jewish field , but she did begin writing for other Anglo-Jewish papers and thus increased her output and her audience .</s>

<s>and she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of Judas Maccabeus performed at the Hanukkah festival which came in December .</s>

<s>by her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that Papa and Mamma gave her a Life Of Dickens as a spur to her aspiration .</s>

<s>another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of Johns Hopkins University within walking distance of home .</s>

<s>it was established in a couple of buildings in the shopping district , with only a few professors , but all eminent men , and a few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings .</s>

<s>in September '76 Thomas Huxley , Darwin's famous disciple , came from England to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening of the University ;
and although it was a school for men only , it afforded Henrietta an opportunity to attend its public lectures .</s>

<s>in the following year her father undertook to give a course in Hebrew theology to Johns Hopkins students , and this brought to the Szold house a group of bright young Jews who had come to Baltimore to study , and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by Mamma and entertained by Henrietta and Rachel , who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting room on Sunday evenings .</s>

<s>from Philadelphia came Cyrus Adler and Joseph Jastrow .</s>

<s>Adler , Judge Sulzberger's nephew , came to study Assyriology .</s>

<s>a smart , shrewd and ambitious young man , well connected , and with a knack for getting in the good graces of important people , he was bound to go far .</s>

<s>Joseph Jastrow , the younger son of the distinguished rabbi , Marcus Jastrow , was a friendly , round-faced fellow with a little mustache , whose field was psychology , and who was also a punster and a jolly tease .</s>

<s>his father was a good friend of Rabbi Szold , and Joe lived with the Szolds for a while .</s>

<s>both these youths , who greatly admired Henrietta , were somewhat younger than she , as were also the neighboring Friedenwald boys , who were then studying medicine ;
and bright though they all were , they could not possibly compete for her interest with Papa , whose mind -- although he never tried to dazzle or patronize lesser lights with it -- naturally eclipsed theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were .</s>

<s>besides , Miss Henrietta -- as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back -- had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing ;
so Cyrus Adler became interested in her friend Racie Friedenwald , and Joe Jastrow -- the only young man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as Henrietta , and signed himself Joe -- fell in love with pretty sister Rachel .</s>

<s>Henrietta , however , was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with Joe's older and more serious brother , Morris , who was just about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to Philadelphia with Papa , when he substituted for Rabbi Jastrow at Rodeph Shalom Temple there during its Rabbi's absence in Europe .</s>

<s>young Morris , who , while attending the University of Pennsylvania , also taught and edited a paper , found time to write Henrietta twenty-page letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of Sarah Bernhardt in Philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of Sulamith on the Jewish reform movement being promulgated by the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati .</s>

<s>unlike his younger brother , Joe , he never presumed to address her more familiarly than as my dear friend , although he praised and envied the elegance and purity of her style .</s>

<s>and when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , Henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and Papa did .</s>

<s>one thing Papa had not taught Henrietta was how to handle a young man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself .</s>

<s>she could not resist the opportunity of showing her superiority in argument over a man which she had remarked as one of the feminine follies of Sara Sullam ;
and in her forthright way , Henrietta , who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness to think of men as the privileged and women as submissive and yielding , felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris Jastrow took the slightest exception -- he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair , as well as on the radical reforms of Dr.</s>

<s>Wise of Hebrew Union College -- until once , in sheer desperation , he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything .</s>

<s>but that did not prevent him from writing more long letters , or from coming to spend his Christmas vacations with the hospitable , lively Szolds in their pleasant house on Lombard Street .</s>

<s>1880s : little women we've got Father and Mother and each other said Beth on the first page of Louisa Alcott's Little Women ;
and , I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world , burst out Jo some five hundred pages later in that popular story of the March family , which had first appeared when Henrietta was eight ;
and the Szold family , as it developed , bore a striking resemblance to the Marches .</s>

<s>Mr. March , like Benjamin Szold , was a clergyman , although of an indeterminate denomination ;
and Marmee March , like Sophie Szold , was the competent manager of her brood of girls , of whom the Marches had only four to the Szolds' five .</s>

<s>but the March girls had their counterparts in the Szold girls .</s>

<s>Henrietta could easily identify herself with Jo March , although Jo was not the eldest sister .</s>

<s>neither was Henrietta hoydenish like Jo , who frankly wished she were a boy and had deliberately shortened her name , which , like Henrietta's , was the feminine form of a boy's name .</s>

<s>but both were high-spirited and vivacious , both had tempers to control , both loved languages , especially English and German , both were good teachers and wrote for publication .</s>

<s>each was her mother's assistant and confidante ;
and each stood out conspicuously in the family picture .</s>

<s>Bertha Szold was more like Meg , the eldest March girl , who learned that a woman's happiest kingdom is home , her highest honor the art of ruling it , not as a queen , but a wise wife and mother .</s>

<s>Bertha , blue-eyed like Mamma , was from the start her mother's daughter , destined for her mother's role in life .</s>

<s>Sadie , like Beth March , suffered ill health -- got rheumatic fever and had to be careful of her heart -- but that never dampened her spirits .</s>

<s>when her right hand was incapacitated by the rheumatism , Sadie learned to write with her left hand .</s>

<s>she wrote gay plays about the girls for family entertainments , like Oh , What Fun ]
A Comedy In Three Acts , in which , under Personages , Henrietta appeared as a Schoolmarm , and Bertha , who was only a trifle less brilliant in high school than Henrietta had been , appeared as Dummkopf .</s>

<s>Sadie studied piano ;
played Chopin in the Soiree Musicale of Mr. Guthrie's Pupils ;
and she recited Hector's Farewell To Andromache most movingly , to the special delight of Rabbi Jastrow at his home in Germantown near Philadelphia , where the Szold girls took turns visiting between the visits of the Jastrow boys at the Szolds' in Baltimore .</s>

<s>Adele , like Amy , the youngest of the Marches , was the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one .</s>

<s>for Rachel , conceded to be the prettiest of the Szold girls -- and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing in her silvery tones -- there was no particular March counterpart ;
but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content -- the one being definitely Jewish and the other vaguely Christian .</s>

<s>the Szolds , like the Marches , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times ;
and , as in the March home , any young man who called on the Szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them .</s>

<s>this included Mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell in love , just as Papa had first fallen in love with her Mamma before he chose her ;
and when a young man like Morris Jastrow had enjoyed the Szold hospitality , he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to Henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the Szold girls and Mamma .</s>

<s>and just as Laurie Lawrence was first attracted to bright Jo March , who found him immature by her high standards , and then had to content himself with her younger sister Amy , so Joe Jastrow , who had also been writing Henrietta before he came to Johns Hopkins , had to content himself with her younger sister , pretty Rachel .</s>

<s>and like Jo March , who saw her sisters Meg and Amy involved in lovering before herself , Henrietta saw her sisters Rachel and Sadie drawn outside their family circle by the attraction of suitors , Rachel by Joe Jastrow , and Sadie by Max Lobl , a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions of his trips by steamboat down the Mississippi .</s>

<s>this time he was making no mistake .</s>

<s>Olgivanna -- in her country the nickname was a respectful form of address -- was not only attractive but shrewd , durable , sensible , and smart .</s>

<s>no wonder Wright was enchanted -- no two better suited people ever met .</s>

<s>almost from that day , until his death , Olgivanna was to stay at his side ;
but the years that immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying , both for Wright and his Montenegrin lady .</s>

<s>it must be granted that the flouting of convention , no matter how well intentioned one may be , is sure to lead to trouble , or at least to the discomfort that goes with social disapproval .</s>

<s>even so , many of the things that happened to Wright and Olgivanna seem inordinately severe .</s>

<s>their afflictions centered on one maddening difficulty : Miriam held up the divorce proceedings that she herself had asked for .</s>

<s>reporters began to trail Miriam everywhere , and to encourage her to make appalling statements about Wright and his doings .</s>

<s>flocks of writs , attachments , and unpleasant legal papers of every sort began to fly through the air .</s>

<s>the distracted Miriam would agree to a settlement through her legal representative , then change her mind and make another attack on Wright as a person .</s>

<s>at last her lawyer , Arthur D. Cloud , gave up the case because she turned down three successive settlements he arranged .</s>

<s>Cloud made an interesting statement in parting from his client : I wanted to be a lawyer , and Mrs. Wright wanted me to be an avenging angel .</s>

<s>so I got out .</s>

<s>Mrs. Wright is without funds .</s>

<s>the first thing to do is get her some money by a temporary but definite adjustment pending a final disposition of the case .</s>

<s>but every time I suggested this to her , Mrs. Wright turned it down and demanded that I go out and punish Mr. Wright .</s>

<s>I am an attorney , not an instrument of vengeance .</s>

<s>Miriam Noel disregarded the free advice of her departing counselor , and appointed a heavy-faced young man named Harold Jackson to take his place .</s>

<s>there were three years of this strange warfare ;
and during the unhappy time , Miriam often would charge that Wright and Olgivanna were misdemeanants against the public order of Wisconsin .</s>

<s>yet somehow , when officers were prodded into visiting Taliesin to execute the warrants , they would find neither Wright nor Olgivanna at home .</s>

<s>this showed that common sense had not died out at the county and village level -- though why the unhappy and obviously unbalanced woman was not restrained remains a puzzle .</s>

<s>the misery of Miriam's bitterness can be felt today by anyone who studies the case -- it was hopeless , agonizing , and destructive , with Miriam herself bearing the heaviest burden of shame and pain .</s>

<s>to get an idea of the embarrassment and chagrin that was heaped upon Wright and Olgivanna , we should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by Miriam in person .</s>

<s>one of the most distressing of these scenes occurred at Spring Green toward the end of the open warfare , on a beautiful day in June .</s>

<s>at this time Miriam Noel appeared , urging on Constable Henry Pengally , whose name showed him to be a descendant of the Welsh settlers in the neighborhood .</s>

<s>a troop of reporters brought up the rear .</s>

<s>Miriam was stopped at the Taliesin gate , and William Weston , now the estate foreman , came out to parley .</s>

<s>he said that Mr. Wright was not in , and so could not be arrested on something called a peace warrant that Miriam was waving in the air .</s>

<s>Miriam now ordered Pengally to break down the gate , but he said he really couldn't go that far .</s>

<s>at this point Mrs. Frances Cupply , one of Wright's handsome daughters by his first wife , came from the house and tried to calm Miriam as she tore down a no visitors sign and smashed the glass pane on another sign with a rock .</s>

<s>Miriam Noel Wright said , here I am at my own home , locked out so I must stand in the road ]
then she rounded on Weston and cried , you always did Wright's dirty work ]
when I take over Taliesin , the first thing I'll do is fire you .</s>

<s>Madame Noel , I think you had better go , said Mrs. Cupply .</s>

<s>and I think you had better leave , replied Miriam .</s>

<s>turning to the reporters , she asked , did you hear her ?</s>

<s>I think you had better leave ]
and this is my own home .</s>

<s>in the silence that followed , Miriam walked close to Mrs. Cupply , who drew back a step on her side of the gate .</s>

<s>then , with staring eyes and lips drawn thin , Miriam said to the young woman , you are ugly -- uglier than you used to be , and you were always very ugly .</s>

<s>you are even uglier than Mr. Wright .</s>

<s>the animosity expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a natural force ;
and it gave Miriam Noel a fund of energy like that of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art .</s>

<s>as if to make certain that Wright would be unable to pay any settlement at all , Miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him ;
she also went to Washington and appealed to Senator George William Norris of Nebraska , the Fighting Liberal , from whose office a sympathetic but cautious harrumphing was heard .</s>

<s>then , after overtures to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce , Miriam gave a ghastly echo of Mrs. Micawber by suddenly stating , I will never leave Mr. Wright .</s>

<s>under this kind of pressure , it is not surprising that Wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers .</s>

<s>Miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly , but one can feel the generalized anger in Wright's remarks to reporters when he was asked , one morning on arrival in Chicago , what he thought of the city as a whole .</s>

<s>first , Wright said , he was choked by the smoke , which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful town .</s>

<s>but surely Michigan Avenue was handsome ?</s>

<s>that isn't a boulevard , it's a racetrack ]
cried Wright , showing that automobiles were considered to be a danger as early as the 1920's .</s>

<s>this is a horrible way to live , Wright went on .</s>

<s>you are being strangled by traffic .</s>

<s>he was then asked for a solution of the difficulty , and began to talk trenchant sense , though private anguish showed through in the vehemence of his manner .</s>

<s>take a gigantic knife and sweep it over the Loop , Wright said .</s>

<s>cut off every building at the seventh floor .</s>

<s>spread everything out .</s>

<s>you don't need concentration .</s>

<s>if you cut down these horrible buildings you'll have no more traffic jams .</s>

<s>you'll have trees again .</s>

<s>you'll have some joy in the life of this city .</s>

<s>after all , that's the job of the architect -- to give the world a little joy .</s>

<s>little enough joy was afforded Wright in the spring of 1925 , when another destructive fire broke out at Taliesin .</s>

<s>the first news stories had it that this blaze was started by a bolt of lightning , as though Miriam could call down fire from heaven like a prophet of the Old Testament .</s>

<s>a storm did take place that night , and fortunately enough , it included a cloudburst that helped put out the flames .</s>

<s>later accounts blamed defective wiring for starting the fire ;
at any rate , heat grew so intense in the main part of the house that it melted the window panes , and fused the K'ang-si pottery to cinders .</s>

<s>Wright set his loss at $200,000 , a figure perhaps justified by the unique character of the house that had been ruined , and the faultless taste that had gone into the selection of the prints and other things that were destroyed .</s>

<s>in spite of the disaster , Wright completed during this period plans for the Lake Tahoe resort , in which he suggested the shapes of American Indian tepees -- a project of great and appropriate charm , that came to nothing .</s>

<s>amid a shortage of profitable work , the memory of Albert Johnson's $20,000 stood out in lonely grandeur -- the money had quickly melted away .</s>

<s>a series of conferences with friends and bankers began about this time ;
and the question before these meetings was , here is a man of international reputation and proved earning power ;
how can he be financed so that he can find the work he ought to do ?</s>

<s>while this was under consideration , dauntless as ever Wright set about the building of Taliesin 3 .</s>

<s>as he made plans for the new Taliesin , Wright also got on paper his conception of a cathedral of steel and glass to house a congregation of all faiths , and the idea for a planetarium with a sloping ramp .</s>

<s>years were to pass before these plans came off the paper , and Wright was justified in thinking , as the projects failed , that much of what he had to show his country and the world would never be seen except by visitors to Taliesin .</s>

<s>and now there was some question as to his continued residence there .</s>

<s>Billy Koch , who had once worked for Wright as a chauffeur , gave a deposition for Miriam's use that he had seen Olgivanna living at Taliesin .</s>

<s>this might put Wright in such a bad light before a court that Miriam would be awarded Taliesin ;
nor was she moved by a letter from Wright pointing out that if he was not compelled to spend money on useless lawyer's bills , useless hotel bills , and useless doctor's bills , he could more quickly provide Miriam with a suitable home either in Los Angeles or Paris , as she preferred .</s>

<s>Miriam sniffed at this , and complained that Wright had said unkind things about her to reporters .</s>

<s>his reply was , everything that has been printed derogatory to you , purporting to have come from me , was a betrayal , and nothing yet has been printed which I have sanctioned .</s>

<s>what irritated Miriam was that Wright had told the papers about a reasonable offer he had made , which he considered she would accept when she tires of publicity .</s>

<s>from her California headquarters , Miriam fired back , I shall never divorce Mr. Wright , to permit him to marry Olga Milanoff .</s>

<s>then Miriam varied the senseless psychological warfare by suddenly withdrawing a suit for separate maintenance that had been pending , and asking for divorce on the grounds of cruelty , with the understanding that Wright would not contest it .</s>

<s>the Bank of Wisconsin sent a representative to the judge's chambers in Madison to give information on Wright's ability to meet the terms .</s>

<s>he said that the architect might reasonably be expected to carry his financial burdens if all harrassment could be brought to an end , and that the bank would accept a mortgage on Taliesin to help bring this about .</s>

<s>Miriam said that she must be assured that that other woman , Olga , will not be in luxury while I am scraping along .</s>

<s>this exhausted Wright's patience , and in consequence he talked freely to reporters in a Madison hotel suite .</s>

<s>Volstead laws , speed laws , divorce laws , he said , as they now stand , demoralize the individual , make liars and law breakers of us in one way or another , and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd .</s>

<s>if Mrs. Wright doesn't accept the terms in the morning , I'll go either to Tokyo or to Holland , to do what I can .</s>

<s>I realize , in taking this stand , just what it means to me and mine .</s>

<s>here Wright gave a slight sigh of weariness , and continued , it means more long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people , making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect and misunderstanding as I best can for myself and those dependent upon me .</s>

<s>next day , word came that Miriam was not going through with the divorce ;
but Wright stayed in the United States .</s>

<s>his mentioning of Japan and Holland had been merely the expression of wishful thinking .</s>

<s>no matter what troubles might betide him , this most American of artists knew in his heart he could not function properly outside his native land .</s>

<s>in a few weeks Miriam made another sortie at Taliesin , but was repulsed at the locked and guarded gates .</s>

<s>more likely , you simply told yourself , as you handed us the book , that it mattered little what we incanted providing we underwent the discipline of incantation .</s>

<s>for pride's sake , I will not say that the coy and leering vade mecum of those verses insinuated itself into my soul .</s>

<s>besides , that particular message does no more than weakly echo the roar in all fresh blood .</s>

<s>but what you could not know , of course , was how smoothly the Victorian Fitzgerald was to lead into an American Fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we adolescents were to come , if not of age , then into a bright , taut semblance of it .</s>

<s>I do not suppose you ever heard of F. Scott Fitzgerald , living or dead , and moreover I do not suppose that , even if you had , his legend would have seemed to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval .</s>

<s>neither his appetites , his exacerbations , nor his despair were kin to yours .</s>

<s>he might have been the man in the moon for all you could have understood him .</s>

<s>but he was no man in the moon to me .</s>

<s>although his tender nights were not the ones I dreamed of , nor was it for yachts , sports cars , tall drinks , and swimming pools , nor yet for money or what money buys that I burned , I too was burning and watching myself burn .</s>

<s>the flame was simply of a different kind .</s>

<s>it was symbolized ( at least for those of us who recognized ourselves in the image ) by that self-consuming , elegiac candle of Edna St. Vincent Millay's , that candle which from the quatrain where she ensconced it became a beacon to us , but which in point of fact would have had to be as tall as a funeral taper to last even the evening , let alone the night .</s>

<s>one should not , of course , pluck the head off a flower and expect its perfume to linger on .</s>

<s>yet this passion for passion , now that I look back on it with passion spent , seems somewhat overblown and operatic , though as a diva Miss Millay perfectly controlled her notes .</s>

<s>only what else was she singing but the old Song of Songs , that most ancient of tunes that nature plays with such unfailing response upon young nerves ?</s>

<s>perhaps this is not so little .</s>

<s>perhaps the mere fact that by plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us , temporarily anyway , the sleeping poet , and in poets can discover their immortality , is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to which we can attest ?</s>

<s>one can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives for a lover or a friend ;
one can take it as no more than another veil torn from the mystery of the soul .</s>

<s>but it could also be looked at from the other end of the spectrum .</s>

<s>one could see this chemical determinant as in itself a miracle .</s>

<s>in any case , Miss Millay's sweet-throated bitterness , her variations on the theme that the world was not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love , her constant and wonderfully tragic posture , so unlike that of Fitzgerald since it required no scenery or props , drew from the me that I was when I fell upon her verses an overwhelming yea .</s>

<s>but all this , I am well aware , is the bel canto of love , and although I have always liked to think that it was to the bel canto and to that alone that I listened , I know well enough that it was not .</s>

<s>if I am to speak the whole truth about my knowledge of love , I will have to stop trying to emulate the transcendant nightingale .</s>

<s>there is another side of love , more nearly symbolized by the croak of the mating capercailzie , or better still perhaps by the mute antics of the slug .</s>

<s>whether you experienced the passion of desire I have , of course , no way of knowing , nor indeed have I wished with even the most fleeting fragment of a wish to know , for the fact that one constitutes by one's mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any speculation upon this part of one's parents' experience more immodest , more scandalizing , more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from a stranger .</s>

<s>I recoil from the very thought .</s>

<s>at the same time , I am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign , since theirs is a science of paradox : if one hates , they say it is because one loves ;
if one bullies , they say it is because one is afraid ;
if one shuns , they say it is because one desires ;
and according to them , whatever one fancies one feels , what one feels in fact is the opposite .</s>

<s>well , normally abnormal or normally normal , neurotic or merely fastidious ( do the tea-leaf readers , by the way , allow psyches to have moral taste ?
)</s>

<s>, I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion .</s>

<s>you probably would not remember , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as I , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the Farm .</s>

<s>I can see us now .</s>

<s>we had been walking quite briskly , for despite your being so small and me so tall , your stride in those days could easily match mine .</s>

<s>we had stopped before a shop window to assess its autumnal display , when you suddenly turned to me , looking up from beneath one of your wrong hats , and with your nervous ahem ]
said : there are things I must tell you about this man you are marrying which he does not know himself .</s>

<s>if you had screamed right there in the street where we stood , I could not have felt more fear .</s>

<s>with scarcely a mumble of excuse , I fled .</s>

<s>I fled , however , not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise from you that the things about my bridegroom -- in the sense you meant the word things -- which you had been galvanizing yourself to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which I had already insisted upon finding out for myself ( despite , I may now say , the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle , yes , on principle , and in cold blood ) because I was resolved , as a modern woman , not to be a mollycoddle waiting for Life but to seize Life by the throat .</s>

<s>I had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid of self-betrayal .</s>

<s>what I fled from was my fear of what , unwittingly , you might betray , without meaning to , about my father and yourself .</s>

<s>but I can see from this latest trick of memory how much more arbitrary and influential it is than the will .</s>

<s>while my memory holds with relentless tenacity , as I cannot too often stress , to my wrongs , when it comes to my shames , it gestures and jokes and toys with chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope of distracting me from them .</s>

<s>just as I was about to enlarge upon my discovery of the underside of the leaf of love , memory , displeased at being asked to yield its unsavory secrets , dashed ahead of me , calling back over its shoulder : skip it .</s>

<s>cut it out .</s>

<s>but I will not skip it or cut it out .</s>

<s>it is not my intention in this narrative to picture myself as a helpless victim moored to the rock of experience and left to the buffetings of chance .</s>

<s>if to be innocent is to be helpless , then I had been -- as are we all -- helpless at the start .</s>

<s>but the time came when I was no longer innocent and therefore no longer helpless .</s>

<s>helpless in that sense I can never be again .</s>

<s>however , I confess my hope that I will be innocent again , not with a pristine , accidental innocence , but rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh to reach the bone .</s>

<s>for innocence , of all the graces of the spirit , is I believe the one most to be prayed for .</s>

<s>although it is constantly made to look foolish ( too simple to come in out of the rain , people say , who have found in the innocent an impediment ) , it does not mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks .</s>

<s>it assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best , and when they seem worst it overlooks them .</s>

<s>to innocence , a word given is a word that will be kept .</s>

<s>instinctively , innocence does unto others as it expects to be done by .</s>

<s>but when these expectations are once too often ground into the dust , innocence can falter , since its strength is according to the strength of him who possesses it .</s>

<s>the innocence of which I speak is , I know , not incorruptible .</s>

<s>but I insist upon believing that even when it is lost , it may , like paradise , be regained .</s>

<s>however , it was not of innocence in general that I was speaking , but of perhaps the frailest and surely the least important side of it which is innocence in romantic love .</s>

<s>here , if anywhere , it is not wholly incontrovertible .</s>

<s>to you , for instance , the word innocence , in this connotation , probably retained its Biblical , or should I say technical sense , and therefore I suppose I must make myself quite clear by saying that I lost -- or rather handed over -- what you would have considered to be my innocence two weeks before I was legally entitled , and in fact by oath required , to hand it over along with what other goods and bads I had .</s>

<s>but to me innocence is far less tangible .</s>

<s>I had long since begun to lose my general innocence when I lost my trust in you , but this special innocence I lost before ever I loved , through my discovery that one could tremble with desire and even experience a flaming delight that had nothing , nothing whatever to do with friendship or liking , let alone with love .</s>

<s>I knew this knowledge to be corrupting at the time I acquired it ;
today , these many years later , after all the temptations resisted or yielded to , the weasel satisfactions and the engulfing dissatisfactions since endured , I call it corrupting still .</s>

<s>you , I could swear to it , remained innocent in this sense until the end .</s>

<s>yours , but not mine , was an age in which innocence was fostered and carefully -- if not perhaps altogether innocently -- preserved .</s>

<s>you had grown up at a time when the most distinguishing mark of a lady was the noli me tangere writ plain across her face .</s>

<s>moreover , because of the particular blot on your family escutcheon through what may only have been one unbridled moment on your grandmother's part , and because you had the lean-to kitchen and trundle bed of your childhood to outgrow , what you obviously most desired with both your conscious and unconscious person , what you bent your whole will , sensibility , and intelligence upon , was to be a lady .</s>

<s>before being daughter , wife , or mother , before being cultured ( a word now bereft both socially and politically of the sheen you children of frontiersmen bestowed on it ) , before being sorry for the poor , progressive about public health , and prettily if somewhat imprecisely humanitarian , indeed first and foremost , you were a lady .</s>

<s>there was , of course , more to the portrait of a lady you carried in your mind's eye than the sine qua non of her virtue .</s>

<s>a lady , you made clear to me both by precept and example , never raised her voice or slumped in her chair , never failed in social tact ( in heaven , for instance , would not mention St. John the Baptist's head ) , never pouted or withdrew or scandalized in company , never reminded others of her physical presence by unseemly sound or gesture , never indulged in public scenes or private confidences , never spoke of money save in terms of alleviating suffering , never gossiped or maligned , never stressed but always minimized the hopelessness of anything from sin to death itself .</s>

<s>with each song he gave verbal footnotes .</s>

<s>the songs Sandburg sang often reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely or in fragments .</s>

<s>often these listeners would refer Sandburg to persons who had similar ballads or ditties .</s>

<s>in due time Sandburg was a walking thesaurus of American folk music .</s>

<s>after he had finished the first two volumes of his Lincoln , Sandburg went to work assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the memory of songs others had taught him .</s>

<s>he rummaged , found composers and arrangers , collaborated on the main design and outline of harmonization with musicians , ballad singers , and musicologists .</s>

<s>the result was a collection of 280 songs , ballads , ditties , brought together from all regions of America , more than one hundred never before published : the American Songbag .</s>

<s>each song or ditty was prefaced by an author's note which indicated the origin and meaning of the song as well as special interest the song had , musical arrangement , and most of the chorus and verses .</s>

<s>the book , published in 1927 , has been selling steadily ever since .</s>

<s>as Sandburg said at the time : it is as ancient as the medieval European ballads brought to the Appalachian Mountains , it is as modern as skyscrapers , the Volstead Act , and the latest oil well gusher .</s>

<s>Schopenhauer never learned Sandburg is in constant demand as an entertainer .</s>

<s>two things contribute to his popularity .</s>

<s>first , Carl respects his audience and prepares his speeches carefully .</s>

<s>even when he is called upon for impromptu remarks , he has notes written on the back of handy envelopes .</s>

<s>he has his own system of shorthand , devised by abbreviations : humility will be humly , with will be J , and that will be J .</s>

<s>the second reason for his popularity is his complete spontaneity with the guitar .</s>

<s>it is a mistake , however , to imagine that Sandburg uses the guitar as a prop .</s>

<s>he is no dextrous-fingered college boy but rather a dedicated , humble , and bashful apostle of this instrument .</s>

<s>at age seventy-four , he became what he shyly terms a pupil of Andres Segovia , the great guitarist of the Western world .</s>

<s>it is not easy to become Segovia's pupil .</s>

<s>one needs high talent .</s>

<s>Segovia has written about Carl : his fingers labor heavily on the strings and he asked for my help in disciplining them .</s>

<s>I found that this precocious , grown-up boy of 74 deserved to be taught .</s>

<s>there has long existed a brotherly affection between us , thus I accepted him as my pupil .</s>

<s>just as in the case of every prodigy child , we must watch for the efficacy of my teaching to show up in the future -- if he should master all the strenuous exercises I inflicted on him .</s>

<s>to play the guitar as he aspires will devour his three-fold energy as a historian , a poet and a singer .</s>

<s>one cause of Schopenhauer's pessimism was the fact that he failed to learn the guitar .</s>

<s>I am certain that Carl Sandburg will not fall into the same sad philosophy .</s>

<s>the heart of this great poet constantly bubbles forth a generous joy of life -- with or without the guitar .</s>

<s>the public's identification of Carl Sandburg and the guitar is no happenstance .</s>

<s>nor does Carl reject this identity .</s>

<s>he is proud of having Segovia for a friend and dedicated a poem to him titled The Guitar .</s>

<s>Carl says it is the greatest poem ever written to the guitar because he has never heard of any other poem to that subtle instrument .</s>

<s>a portable companion always ready to go where you go -- a small friend weighing less than a freshborn infant -- to be shared with few or many -- just two of you in sweet meditation .</s>

<s>the New York Herald Tribune's photographer , Ira Rosenberg , tells an anecdote about the time he wanted to take a picture of Carl playing a guitar .</s>

<s>Carl hadn't brought his along .</s>

<s>Mr. Rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one .</s>

<s>preferably , said Carl , one battered and worn , such as might be found in a pawnshop .</s>

<s>they went to the pawnshop of Joseph Miller of 1162 Sixth Avenue .</s>

<s>Mr. Miller was in the shop , the Herald Tribune story related , but was reluctant to have anybody's picture taken inside , because his business was too confidential for pictures .</s>

<s>but after introductions he asked : Carl Sandburg ?</s>

<s>well you can pose inside .</s>

<s>he wanted Mr. Sandburg to pose with one of the guitars he had displayed behind glass in the center of his shop , but the poet eyed this somewhat distastefully .</s>

<s>Kalamazoo guitars , he said , used by radio hillbilly singers .</s>

<s>he chose one from Mr. Miller's window , a plain guitar with no fancy polish .</s>

<s>while the picture was taken , Mr. Miller's disposition to be generous to Mr. Sandburg increased to the point where he advised , I won't even charge you the one dollar rental fee .</s>

<s>a knowledgeable celebrity when someone in the audience rose and asked how does it feel to be a celebrity , Carl said , a celebrity is a fellow who eats celery with celerity .</s>

<s>this has always been Carl's attitude .</s>

<s>Lloyd Lewis wrote that when he first knew Carl in 1916 , Sandburg was making $27.50 a week writing features for the Day Book and eating sparse luncheons in one-arm restaurants .</s>

<s>he walked home at night for two miles beyond the end of a suburban trolley .</s>

<s>when fame came it changed Sandburg only slightly .</s>

<s>Lewis remembered another newspaperman asking , Carl , have your ideas changed any since you got all these comforts ?</s>

<s>Carl thought the question over slowly and answered : I know a starving man who is fed never remembers all the pangs of his starvation , I know that .</s>

<s>that was all he said , Lewis reports .</s>

<s>that was all he had to say .</s>

<s>in answer to a New York Times query on what is fame ( Thoughts On Fame , October 23 , 1960 ) , Carl said : fame is a figment of a pigment .</s>

<s>it comes and goes .</s>

<s>it changes with every generation .</s>

<s>there never were two fames alike .</s>

<s>one fame is precious and luminous ;
another is a bubble of a bauble .</s>

<s>ah , did you once see Shelley plain ?</s>

<s>the impression you get from Carl Sandburg's home is one of laughter and happiness ;
and the laughter and the happiness are even more pronounced when no company is present .</s>

<s>Carl has been married to Paula for fifty-three years , and he has not made a single major decision without careful consideration and thorough discussion with his wife .</s>

<s>through all these years , Mrs. Sandburg has pointedly avoided the limelight .</s>

<s>she has shared her husband's greatness , but only within the confines of their home ;
it is a dedication which began the moment she met Carl .</s>

<s>Mrs. Sandburg received a Phi Beta Kappa key from the University of Chicago and she was busy writing and teaching when she met Sandburg .</s>

<s>you are the Peoples' Poet was her appraisal in 1908 , and she stopped teaching and writing to devote herself to the fulfillment of her husband's career .</s>

<s>she has rarely been photographed with him and , except for Carl's seventy-fifth anniversary celebration in Chicago in 1953 , she has not attended the dozens of banquets , functions , public appearances , and dinners honoring him -- all of this upon her insistence .</s>

<s>even now I will not intrude upon her except to state a few bare facts .</s>

<s>the only way to describe Paula Sandburg is to say she is beautiful in a Grecian sense .</s>

<s>her clothes , her hair , everything about her is both graceful and simple .</s>

<s>she has small , broad , capable hands and an enormous energy .</s>

<s>she is not only a trained mathematician and Classicist , but a good architect .</s>

<s>she designed and supervised the building of the Harbert , Michigan , house , most of which was constructed by one local carpenter who carried the heavy beams singly upon his shoulder .</s>

<s>as the Sandburg goat herd increased , she also designed the barn alterations to accommodate them .</s>

<s>when erosion threatened the foundation of their home in Harbert , Paula Sandburg planted grapevines and arranged the snow fences which helped hold the sands away .</s>

<s>she was born Lilian Steichen , her parents immigrants from Luxemburg .</s>

<s>her mother called her Paus'l , a Luxemburg endearment meaning pussycat .</s>

<s>some of the children of the family could not pronounce this name and called her Paula , a soubriquet Carl liked so much she has been Paula ever since .</s>

<s>but neither was Lilian her baptismal name .</s>

<s>her parents , pious Roman Catholics , christened her Mary Anne Elizabeth Magdalene Steichen .</s>

<s>my mother read a book right after I was born and there was a Lilian in the book she loved and I became Lilian -- and eventually I became Paula .</s>

<s>Lilian Steichen was an exceptional student .</s>

<s>this family of Luxemburg immigrants , in fact , produced two exceptional children .</s>

<s>Paula's older brother is Edward Steichen , a talented artist and , for the past half-century , one of the world's eminent photographers .</s>

<s>( two years ago the photography editor of Vogue Magazine titled his article about Steichen , The World's Greatest Photographer .
)</s>

<s>by the time Lilian had been graduated from public school , her parents were doing quite well .</s>

<s>her mother was a good manager and established a millinery business in Milwaukee .</s>

<s>but her father was not enthusiastic about sending young Paula to high school .</s>

<s>this is no place for a young girl , he said .</s>

<s>the parents compromised , however , on a convent school and Paula went to Ursuline Academy in London , Ontario .</s>

<s>she was pious , too , once kneeling through the night from Holy Thursday to Good Friday , despite the protest of the nuns that this was too much for a young girl .</s>

<s>she knelt out of reverence for having read the Meditations of St. Augustine .</s>

<s>she read everything else she could get her hands on , including an article ( she thinks it was in the Atlantic Monthly ) by Mark Twain on White Slavery .</s>

<s>Paula was saddened about what was happening to little girls and vowed to kneel no more in Chapel .</s>

<s>she had come to a decision .</s>

<s>if there was ever a thought in her mind she might devote her life to religion , it was now dispelled .</s>

<s>I felt that I must devote myself to the outside world .</s>

<s>she passed the entrance examinations to the University of Illinois , but during the year at Urbana felt more important events transpired at the University of Chicago .</s>

<s>and besides , Thorstein Veblen was one of the Chicago professors .</s>

<s>at the University of Chicago she studied Whitman and Shelley , and became a Socialist .</s>

<s>Socialist leaders in Milwaukee recognized her worth , not only because of her dedication but because of her fluency in German , French , and Luxemburg .</s>

<s>she once gave a German recitation before a convention of German-language teachers in Milwaukee .</s>

<s>Carl and Paula met in Milwaukee in 1907 during Paula's Christmas holiday visit to her parents .</s>

<s>Carl was still Charles A. Sandburg .</s>

<s>he legitimized Paula for Lilian Steichen , and it was Paula who insisted on Carl for Charles .</s>

<s>Victor Berger , the panjandrum of Wisconsin Socialism and member of Congress , had asked Paula Steichen to translate some of his German editorials into English .</s>

<s>Carl , who was stationed in Appleton , Wisconsin , organizing for the Social Democrats , was in Berger's office and made it his business to escort Paula to the streetcar .</s>

<s>she left the next day for her teaching job at Princeton , Illinois .</s>

<s>( after graduation from the University of Chicago , Paula taught for two years in the normal school at Valley City , North Dakota , then two years at Princeton ( Illinois ) Township High School .
)</s>

<s>by the time the streetcar pulled away , he had fallen in love with Paula .</s>

<s>a letter awaited her at Princeton .</s>

<s>Paula says that even though Carl's letters usually began , dear Miss Steichen , there was an understanding from the beginning that they would become husband and wife .</s>

<s>Paula generously lent me one of Carl's love letters , dated February 21 , 1908 , Hotel Athearn , Oshkosh , Wisconsin : dear Miss Steichen : it is a very good letter you send me -- softens the intensity of this guerilla warfare I am carrying on up here .</s>

<s>never until in this work of J organization have I realized and felt the attitude and experience of a Teacher .</s>

<s>the United States is always ready to participate with the Soviet Union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that may lead to peace with justice .</s>

<s>certainly it is not necessary to repeat that the United States has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of any nation ;
by the same token , we reject any Soviet attempt to impose its system on us or other peoples by force or subversion .</s>

<s>now this concern for the freedom of other peoples is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has allied us with more than forty other nations in a common defense effort .</s>

<s>not for a moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these countries ;
we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our solemn commitments to them .</s>

<s>we and our friends are , of course , concerned with self-defense .</s>

<s>growing out of this concern is the realization that all people of the Free World have a great stake in the progress , in freedom , of the uncommitted and newly emerging nations .</s>

<s>these peoples , desperately hoping to lift themselves to decent levels of living must not , by our neglect , be forced to seek help from , and finally become virtual satellites of , those who proclaim their hostility to freedom .</s>

<s>but they must have technical and investment assistance .</s>

<s>this is a problem to be solved not by America alone , but also by every nation cherishing the same ideals and in position to provide help .</s>

<s>in recent years America's partners and friends in Western Europe and Japan have made great economic progress .</s>

<s>the international economy of 1960 is markedly different from that of the early postwar years .</s>

<s>no longer is the United States the only major industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the resources so urgently needed in the newly developed countries .</s>

<s>to remain secure and prosperous themselves , wealthy nations must extend the kind of co-operation to the less fortunate members that will inspire hope , confidence , and progress .</s>

<s>a rich nation can for a time , without noticeable damage to itself , pursue a course of self-indulgence , making its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens -- thus repudiating its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful and prosperous society of nations .</s>

<s>but the enmities it will incur , the isolation into which it will descend , and the internal moral and spiritual softness that will be engendered , will , in the long term , bring it to economic and political disaster .</s>

<s>America did not become great through softness and self-indulgence .</s>

<s>her miraculous progress in material achievements flows from other qualities far more worthy and substantial : adherence to principles and methods consonant with our religious philosophy ;
a satisfaction in hard work ;
the readiness to sacrifice for worthwhile causes ;
the courage to meet every challenge ;
the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the true path of her own best interests .</s>

<s>to us and to every nation of the Free World , rich or poor , these qualities are necessary today as never before if we are to march together to greater security , prosperity and peace .</s>

<s>I believe that the industrial countries are ready to participate actively in supplementing the efforts of the developing nations to achieve progress .</s>

<s>the immediate need for this kind of co-operation is underscored by the strain in this nation's international balance of payments .</s>

<s>our surplus from foreign business transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments overseas , to finance private investment , and to provide assistance to the less developed nations .</s>

<s>in 1959 our deficit in balance of payments approached four billion dollars .</s>

<s>continuing deficits of anything like this magnitude would , over time , impair our own economic growth and check the forward progress of the Free World .</s>

<s>we must meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and world trade .</s>

<s>further , we must induce all industrialized nations of the Free World to work together to help lift the scourge of poverty from less fortunate .</s>

<s>this co-operation in this matter will provide both for the necessary sharing of this burden and in bringing about still further increases in mutually profitable trade .</s>

<s>new Nations , and others struggling with the problems of development , will progress only -- regardless of any outside help -- if they demonstrate faith in their own destiny and use their own resources to fulfill it .</s>

<s>moreover , progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earned ;
there is no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane .</s>

<s>but , just as we drew on Europe for assistance in our earlier years , so now do these new and emerging nations that do have this faith and determination deserve help .</s>

<s>respecting their need , one of the major focal points of our concern is the South-Asian region .</s>

<s>here , in two nations alone , are almost five hundred million people , all working , and working hard , to raise their standards , and in doing so , to make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology that would destroy liberty .</s>

<s>I cannot express to you the depth of my conviction that , in our own and free world interest , we must co-operate with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions , as expressed in their different multi-year plans .</s>

<s>through the World Bank and other instrumentalities , as well as through individual action by every nation in position to help , we must squarely face this titanic challenge .</s>

<s>I shall continue to urge the American people , in the interests of their own security , prosperity and peace , to make sure that their own part of this great project be amply and cheerfully supported .</s>

<s>free world decisions in this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom .</s>

<s>other countries , some of which I visited last month , have similar needs .</s>

<s>a common meeting ground is desirable for those nations which are prepared to assist in the development effort .</s>

<s>during the past year I have discussed this matter with the leaders of several Western nations .</s>

<s>because of its wealth of experience , the Organization for European Economic Cooperation could help with the initial studies needed .</s>

<s>the goal is to enlist all available economic resources in the industrialized Free World , especially private investment capital .</s>

<s>by extending this help , we hope to make possible the enthusiastic enrollment of these nations under freedom's banner .</s>

<s>no more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be imagined .</s>

<s>if we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive partnership between the less fortunate nations and those that have already achieved a high state of economic advancement , we will make brighter the outlook for a world order based upon security and freedom .</s>

<s>otherwise , the outlook could be dark indeed .</s>

<s>we face , indeed , what may be a turning point in history , and we must act decisively and wisely .</s>

<s>as a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives only from a position of broadly based strength .</s>

<s>no matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace , we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in negotiating the issue of arms reduction .</s>

<s>until tangible and mutually enforceable arms reduction measures are worked out we will not weaken the means of defending our institutions .</s>

<s>America possesses an enormous defense power .</s>

<s>it is my studied conviction that no nation will ever risk general war against us unless we should become so foolish as to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support .</s>

<s>it is world-wide knowledge that any power which might be tempted today to attack the United States by surprise , even though we might sustain great losses , would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction .</s>

<s>but I once again assure all peoples and all nations that the United States , except in defense , will never turn loose this destructive power .</s>

<s>during the past year , our long-range striking power , unmatched today in manned bombers , has taken on new strength as the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile has entered the operational inventory .</s>

<s>in fourteen recent test launchings , at ranges of five thousand miles , Atlas has been striking on an average within two miles of the target .</s>

<s>this is less than the length of a jet runway -- well within the circle of destruction .</s>

<s>incidentally , there was an Atlas firing last night .</s>

<s>from all reports so far received , its performance conformed to the high standards I have just described .</s>

<s>such performance is a great tribute to American scientists and engineers , who in the past five years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these long-range ballistic missiles , where America had none before .</s>

<s>this year , moreover , growing numbers of nuclear powered submarines will enter our active forces , some to be armed with Polaris missiles .</s>

<s>these remarkable ships and weapons , ranging the oceans , will be capable of accurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth .</s>

<s>to meet situations of less than general nuclear war , we continue to maintain our carrier forces , our many service units abroad , our always ready Army strategic forces and Marine Corps divisions , and the civilian components .</s>

<s>the continuing modernization of these forces is a costly but necessary process .</s>

<s>it is scheduled to go forward at a rate which will steadily add to our strength .</s>

<s>the deployment of a portion of these forces beyond our shores , on land and sea , is persuasive demonstration of our determination to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies for collective security .</s>

<s>moreover , I have directed that steps be taken to program on a longer range basis our military assistance to these allies .</s>

<s>this is necessary for a sounder collective defense system .</s>

<s>next I refer to our program in space exploration , which is often mistakenly supposed to be an integral part of defense research and development .</s>

<s>we note that , first , America has already made great contributions in the past two years to the world's fund of knowledge of astrophysics and space science .</s>

<s>these discoveries are of present interest chiefly to the scientific community ;
but they are important foundation stones for more extensive exploration of outer space for the ultimate benefit of all mankind .</s>

<s>second , our military missile program , going forward so successfully , does not suffer from our present lack of very large rocket engines , which are necessary in distant space exploration .</s>

<s>I am assured by experts that the thrust of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements .</s>

<s>third , the United States is pressing forward in the development of large rocket engines to place vehicles of many tons into space for exploration purposes .</s>

<s>fourth , in the meantime , it is necessary to remember that we have only begun to probe the environment immediately surrounding the earth .</s>

<s>using launch systems presently available , we are developing satellites to scout the world's weather ;
satellite relay stations to facilitate and extend communications over the globe ;
for navigation aids to give accurate bearings to ships and aircraft ;
and for perfecting instruments to collect and transmit the data we seek .</s>

<s>fifth , we have just completed a year's experience with our new space law .</s>

<s>I believe it deficient in certain particulars .</s>

<s>suggested improvements will be submitted to the Congress shortly .</s>

<s>the accomplishment of the many tasks I have alluded to requires the continuous strengthening of the spiritual , intellectual , and economic sinews of American life .</s>

<s>the steady purpose of our society is to assure justice , before God , for every individual .</s>

<s>we must be ever alert that freedom does not wither through the careless amassing of restrictive controls or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the issues of the day .</s>

<s>a year ago , when I met with you , the nation was emerging from an economic downturn , even though the signs of resurgent prosperity were not then sufficiently convincing to the doubtful .</s>

<s>today our surging strength is apparent to everyone .</s>

<s>1960 promises to be the most prosperous year in our history .</s>

<s>yet we continue to be afflicted by nagging disorders .</s>

<s>among current problems that require solutions , participated in by citizens as well as government , are : the need to protect the public interest in situations of prolonged labor-management stalemate ;
the persistent refusal to come to grips with a critical problem in one sector of American agriculture ;
the continuing threat of inflation , together with the persisting tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility ;
in certain instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal protection of the law .</s>

<s>the group , upon the issuance of its first press release on December 21 , 1957 , designated itself a Committee of Investigation .</s>

<s>in the course of its inquiry , it took testimony from only seven witnesses .</s>

<s>it heard Bang-Jensen twice and his lawyer , Adolf A. Berle , Jr. , once .</s>

<s>its second press release was on January 15 , 1958 , and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed .</s>

<s>it also implied that Paul Bang-Jensen had been irresponsible .</s>

<s>on January 18 , Ernest Gross conducted a press conference at the U.N. lasting an hour .</s>

<s>here , he openly attacked Bang-Jensen and referred to his aberrant conduct .</s>

<s>this conference was held despite Stavropoulos' assurance to Adolf Berle , who was leaving the same day for Puerto Rico , that nothing would be done until his return on January 22 , except that the Secretary General would probably order the list destroyed .</s>

<s>on January 24 Paul Bang-Jensen , accompanied by Adolf Berle , was met by Dragoslav Protitch and Colonel Frank Begley , former Police Chief of Farmington , Conn. , and now head of U.N. special police .</s>

<s>the four , bundled in overcoats , mounted to the wind-swept roof of the U.N. there , Begley lit a fire in a wire basket , and Bang-Jensen dropped four sealed envelopes into the flames .</s>

<s>in one of these he said were notes on the identities of the eighty-one refugees .</s>

<s>the method of destroying the evidence embarrassed Paul Bang-Jensen .</s>

<s>he knew it would be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence .</s>

<s>he was right , and Peter Marshall could not help but recall Andrew Cordier's words on the subject , well , it seemed as good a place as any to do the job .</s>

<s>the Gross group had been formed for the express purpose of advising the Secretary General .</s>

<s>Hammarskjold's supposed desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of Ernest Gross is illusion , at best .</s>

<s>Gross's being outside the U.N. applied only to a physical state , not an objective one .</s>

<s>but by the time the papers were finally disposed of , the group had informed the world of its purpose , its recommendations , and its belief that Paul Bang-Jensen was not of sound mind .</s>

<s>shortly the group would issue its report to the Secretary General , recommending Paul Bang-Jensen's dismissal from the United Nations .</s>

<s>the contents of this 195-page document would become known to many before it would become known to the man it was written about .</s>

<s>until this Hungarian Committee matter came up , Bang-Jensen was a fine and devoted individual .</s>

<s>I had known him for some years , when I was a delegate and before , and this manner had never been his .</s>

<s>Ernest A.</s>

<s>Gross leaned back in his chair and told Peter Marshall how Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold had , on December 4 , 1957 , called him in as a private lawyer to review Bang-Jensen's conduct relating to his association with the Special Committee on the problem of Hungary .</s>

<s>the result was the Gross Report , prepared by Gross , as chairman , with the assistance of two U.N.</s>

<s>Under Secretaries , Constantin Stavropoulos and Philippe De Seynes .</s>

<s>yes , Gross went on , Bang-Jensen was an up-and-coming young man .</s>

<s>he had always done well .</s>

<s>never well known , but he had done his work competently .</s>

<s>Gross had received Marshall courteously and they were discussing the case .</s>

<s>you know , the lawyer said , it's difficult to talk like this about a man who can't answer back .</s>

<s>Gross was behind a clean-top desk , only a manila folder before him .</s>

<s>Marshall sat in one of the several leather chairs .</s>

<s>outside the office windows , twenty-four stories above Wall Street , a light rain was falling .</s>

<s>Mr.</s>

<s>Gross , your report says that our function is investigative and advisory and does not in any way derogate from or prejudice Mr. Bang-Jensen's rights as a staff member .</s>

<s>you know , Bang-Jensen characterized your Committee as having prejudged his case .</s>

<s>Gross swung his swivel chair .</s>

<s>well , how could that have been ?</s>

<s>I don't consider that he was prejudged .</s>

<s>we were given a job and we carried it out , and later , his case was taken up by the Disciplinary Committee .</s>

<s>we have nothing to hide under a bushel .</s>

<s>we did our job , Mr. Stavropoulos and Mr. De Seynes and myself , taking evidence from a number of people .</s>

<s>what did you think about his mental state ?</s>

<s>I think our report sums up our finding , Gross answered .</s>

<s>don't forget , here was a man who had been accusing his colleagues for almost a year of willfully attempting to present an incorrect report .</s>

<s>this was not merely alleging errors , but was carried out by day-after-day allegations in memos , written charges of serious consequence .</s>

<s>this is a distressing thing .</s>

<s>supposing you or I were being accused in this manner , and yet we were doing our level best to carry on our work .</s>

<s>no organization can carry on like that .</s>

<s>I've been in government and I can tell some pretty hairy stories about personnel difficulties , so I know what a problem he was .</s>

<s>what I'd like you to comment on is the criticism leveled at your Committee .</s>

<s>what do you mean ?</s>

<s>for instance , regarding the fact that the Gross Committee issued two interim announcements to the press during its investigation .</s>

<s>you know Bang-Jensen was told the Committee was to convey its views , suggestions and recommendations to the Secretary General .</s>

<s>in his own words , Bang-Jensen took it for granted that the Group would report to the Secretary General privately and not in public .</s>

<s>he claimed that the release of the preliminary findings was prejudicial to his position .</s>

<s>Gross bristled .</s>

<s>for an instant he glared speechless at Marshall .</s>

<s>listen , he said .</s>

<s>I thought the entire report was going to be confidential from beginning to end .</s>

<s>but you know Bang-Jensen launched an active campaign against us in the press .</s>

<s>it was getting so that we , the Committee , were being tried .</s>

<s>you can find it in the papers .</s>

<s>well , as a matter of fact , I've looked through back-issue files of New York papers for December , 1957 , and haven't found a great deal -- Gross shot another look at Marshall .</s>

<s>it wasn't necessarily all here in New York .</s>

<s>don't forget the foreign press .</s>

<s>then what about the second interim public announcement ?</s>

<s>this cited Bang-Jensen's aberrant conduct .</s>

<s>the reason for that report was to settle the matter of the list .</s>

<s>as far as I'm concerned , it was a separate matter from the general Committee study of Bang-Jensen's conduct .</s>

<s>the January fifteen report recommended that Bang-Jensen be instructed to burn the list -- the papers -- in the presence of a U.N. Security Officer .</s>

<s>how about your press conference three days later -- what was the reason for that ?</s>

<s>Bang-Jensen said you told correspondents that you had checked in advance to make sure the term aberrant conduct was not libelous .</s>

<s>he claimed you made other slanderous allegations .</s>

<s>Gross paused and repeated himself .</s>

<s>the entire object of the press conference was to clarify the problem of the list , since many in the press were querying the U.N. about it .</s>

<s>what was the list ?</s>

<s>I don't know .</s>

<s>Bang-Jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that he had in his possession .</s>

<s>it was foolish of him to keep them , whatever they were .</s>

<s>he could have been blackmailed , or his family might have been threatened .</s>

<s>of course the matter caught the public's attention .</s>

<s>we attempted to conclude this , and did so by having the papers burned .</s>

<s>Hammarskjold didn't like the way it was carried out .</s>

<s>it was a sort of Gotterdammerung affair .</s>

<s>Hammarskjold believes the U.N. is an organization that settles matters in a procedural way .</s>

<s>Peter Marshall reflected .</s>

<s>if Hammarskjold had not wanted the list disposed of in this manner , and if Bang-Jensen had not wanted it -- who had ordered it ?</s>

<s>Mr.</s>

<s>Gross , concerning the formation of your Committee , there's the fact that you have been a legal adviser to the U.N. in the past ;
as I understand it , Mr. Hammarskjold wanted outside advice .</s>

<s>could you comment on that ?</s>

<s>I've served as a counsel for the U.N. for some years , specializing particularly in real estate matters or other problems that the regular U.N. legal staff might not be equipped to handle .</s>

<s>Mr. Stavropoulos is the U.N. legal chief and a very good man , but he is not fully versed on some technical points of American law .</s>

<s>what did you think about Bang-Jensen's contention of errors and omissions in the Hungarian report ?</s>

<s>Marshall asked .</s>

<s>those ]
Gross answered .</s>

<s>why , Mick Shann went over and over the report with Alsing Andersen , trying to check them out .</s>

<s>even after the incident between Bang-Jensen and Shann in the Delegates' Lounge and this was not the way the Chicago Tribune presented it .</s>

<s>Gross reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper clippings .</s>

<s>one was an article on the U.N. by Alice Widener from the Cincinnati Enquirer .</s>

<s>the other was by Chesly Manley in the Chicago Daily Tribune .</s>

<s>Gross pointed to the Manley story .</s>

<s>I know Ches , he's a friend of mine .</s>

<s>he probably didn't mean to write it this way , or maybe he did .</s>

<s>there wasn't any violent argument between Bang-Jensen and Shann , as the Tribune puts it .</s>

<s>that implies that Shann was on the enemy side .</s>

<s>you see what I mean ?</s>

<s>how it's phrased there -- the word violent .</s>

<s>the case was that Bang-Jensen came up to Shann claiming he had found further errors in the report .</s>

<s>I've found errors and I want you to look them over .</s>

<s>so once again Shann had to argue with him about this .</s>

<s>but it wasn't a violent discussion .</s>

<s>and after all this , Shann went over all that Bang-Jensen had brought up .</s>

<s>( Shann's own report , Peter Marshall reflected , describes the encounter as immoderate .</s>

<s>Bang-Jensen was in hysterical condition .
)</s>

<s>Gross stopped briefly , then went on .</s>

<s>Shann was responsible for the report .</s>

<s>he has felt terrible about all this .</s>

<s>it was a good report , he did all he could to make it a good report .</s>

<s>when I speak of how Shann felt , I know well .</s>

<s>don't forget , I am an old member of the club , a former delegate .</s>

<s>I think you are being unfair to take these things up now .</s>

<s>you know , this hits in many areas .</s>

<s>it appeals to those who were frustrated in the outcome of the Hungarian situation .</s>

<s>don't forget , the U.N. did no more than the United States did .</s>

<s>it takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to get the impact of this fact .</s>

<s>chapter 22 from the home of his friend , Henrik Kauffmann , in Washington , D.C. , Paul Bang-Jensen sent a telegram dated December 9 , 1957 , to Ernest Gross .</s>

<s>it said in part : the matters to be considered are obviously of a grave character , and I therefore respectfully request that the hearing be postponed for two weeks in order that I might make adequate preparation .</s>

<s>Ernest Gross replied the next day , putting the suspended diplomat's fears to rest .</s>

<s>this reveals some misunderstanding on your part .</s>

<s>the group conducting the review is not holding formal hearings .</s>

<s>it wished to pursue , in the course of this review , questions arising from the body of material already in its possession .</s>

<s>it sounded like a fair enough invitation , Peter Marshall reflected , and Bang-Jensen must have thought so too , because on the thirteenth , he met the group of three on the thirty-sixth floor of the U.N. .</s>

<s>there , Ernest Gross further assured him : we were requested by the Secretary General , as I understand it , to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant , and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the Secretariat .</s>

<s>the only rules which I think we shall follow will be those of common sense , justice , and fairness .</s>

<s>Peter Marshall noted that Bang-Jensen had later referred to his two interviews with the Gross group as unfortunate experiences , and after his second meeting on the sixteenth the Dane refused to attend further hearings without legal counsel .</s>

<s>Marshall pondered the reason for this , and pondered too the replacement of one member of the three-man group .</s>

<s>J.</s>

<s>A. C. Robertson , after serving Gross one week , left for England .</s>

<s>fortunately the hole was found at last and plugged .</s>

<s>another week passed and even the missionaries were enjoying the voyage .</s>

<s>the sickness was gone and , after all , the two young couples were on their honeymoon .</s>

<s>the only lasting difficulty was the food .</s>

<s>in spite of Pickering Dodge's explicit instructions regarding variation of meals , the food did not seem the same as at home .</s>

<s>everything tasted differently from what it does on land and those things I was most fond of at home , I loathed the most here , Ann noted .</s>

<s>at last they concluded that the heavy , full feeling in their stomachs was due to lack of exercise .</s>

<s>walking was the remedy , they decided , but a deck full of chicken coops and pigpens was hardly suitable .</s>

<s>skipping was the alternative .</s>

<s>a rope was found and , like children in school , the missionaries skipped for hours at a time .</s>

<s>finally , tiring of so monotonous a form of exercise , they decided to dance instead .</s>

<s>it was much more fun , reminding the girls of their old carefree days in the Hasseltine frolics room at Bradford .</s>

<s>the weather turned warmer and with it came better appetites , although Harriet was still a little off-color .</s>

<s>she could not face coffee or tea without milk , and was always craving types of food that were not available aboard a sailing ship .</s>

<s>by now she was sure she was going to have a baby , deciding it would be born in India or Burma that November .</s>

<s>she was more excited than frightened at the prospect of having her first child in a foreign land .</s>

<s>the crew of the Caravan never failed to amaze Ann , who during her stay in Salem must frequently have overheard strong sailorly language .</s>

<s>she wrote in her journal , I have not heard the least profane language since I have been on board the vessel .</s>

<s>this is very uncommon .</s>

<s>she was now enjoying the voyage very much .</s>

<s>even the first wave of homesickness had passed , although there were moments when Captain Heard pointed out on his compass the direction of Bradford that she felt a little twinge at her heart .</s>

<s>as for Adoniram , she found him to be the kindest of husbands .</s>

<s>on Sundays , with the permission of Captain Heard , who usually attended with two of his officers , services were held in the double cabin .</s>

<s>sometimes a ship would be sighted and the Caravan pass so close that people could easily be seen on the distant deck .</s>

<s>Captain Heard did not communicate with any strange vessels because of the possibility of war between the United States and Britain .</s>

<s>as warmer temperatures were encountered Ann and Harriet were introduced to the pleasures of bathing daily in salt water .</s>

<s>when May came the Caravan had already crossed the Equator .</s>

<s>they were sailing round the Cape of Good Hope ;
the weather had turned wet and cold .</s>

<s>at this time Harriet wrote in a letter which after their finally landing in India was sent to her mother : I care not how soon we reach Calcutta , and are placed in a still room , with a bowl of milk and a loaf of Indian bread .</s>

<s>I can hardly think of this simple fare without exclaiming , oh , what a luxury .</s>

<s>I have been so weary of the excessive rocking of the vessel , and the almost intolerable smell after the rain , that I have done little more than lounge on the bed for several days .</s>

<s>but I have been blest with excellent spirits , and to-day have been running about the deck , and dancing in our room for exercise , as well as ever .</s>

<s>while studying at the seminary in Andover , Adoniram had been working on a New Testament translation from the original Greek .</s>

<s>he had brought it along to continue during the voyage .</s>

<s>there was one particular word that troubled his conscience .</s>

<s>this was the Greek word most often translated as baptism .</s>

<s>born a Congregationalist , he had been baptized as a tiny baby in the usual manner by having a few drops of water sprinkled on his head , yet nowhere in the whole of the New Testament could he find a description of anybody being baptized by sprinkling .</s>

<s>John the Baptist used total immersion in the River Jordan for believers ;
even Christ was baptized by this method .</s>

<s>the more Adoniram looked at the Greek word for baptism , the more unhappy he became over its true meaning .</s>

<s>as was only natural he confided his searchings to Ann , conceding ruefully that it certainly looked as if their own Congregationalists were wrong and the Baptists right .</s>

<s>Ann was very troubled .</s>

<s>by this time she had learned that it was futile to argue with her young husband , yet the uncomfortable fact remained : the American Congregationalists were sending them as missionaries to the Far East and paying their salaries .</s>

<s>what would happen if Adoniram changed horses in midstream ?</s>

<s>Baptists and Congregationalists in New England were on friendly terms .</s>

<s>how embarrassing it would be if the newly appointed Congregationalist missionaries should suddenly switch their own beliefs in order to embrace Baptist teachings ]
if you become a Baptist , I will not , Ann informed her husband , but sweeping her threat aside Adoniram continued to search for an answer to the personal dilemma in which he found himself .</s>

<s>by early June they were a hundred miles off the coast of Ceylon , by which time all four missionaries were hardened seafarers .</s>

<s>even Harriet could boldly write , I know not how it is ;
but I hear the thunder roll ;
see the lightning flash ;
and the waves threatening to swallow up the vessel ;
and yet remain unmoved .</s>

<s>Ann thrilled to the sight of a delicate butterfly and two strange tropical birds .</s>

<s>land was near , and on June 12 , one hundred and fourteen days after leaving America , they actually saw , twenty miles away , the coast of Orissa .</s>

<s>Captain Heard gave orders for the ship to be anchored in the Bay of Bengal until he could obtain the services of a reputable pilot to steer her through the shallow waters .</s>

<s>sometimes ships waited for days for such a man , but Captain Heard was lucky .</s>

<s>next day a ship arrived with an English pilot , his leadsman , an English youth , and the first Hindu the Judsons and Newells had ever seen .</s>

<s>a little man with a a dark copper color skin , he was wearing calico trousers and a white cotton short gown .</s>

<s>Ann was plainly disappointed in his appearance .</s>

<s>he looks as feminine as you can imagine , she decided .</s>

<s>the pilot possessed excellent skill at his calling ;
all day long the Caravan slowly made her way through the difficult passages .</s>

<s>alas , to Ann's consternation , his language while thus employed left much to be desired .</s>

<s>he swore so loudly at the top of his voice , that she didn't get any sleep all the next night .</s>

<s>next morning the Caravan was out of the treacherous Bay .</s>

<s>relieved of the major part of his responsibility for the safety of the ship , the pilot's oaths became fewer .</s>

<s>slowly she moved up the Hooghli River , a mouth of the mighty Ganges , toward Calcutta .</s>

<s>Ann was entranced with the view , as were her husband and friends .</s>

<s>running across the deck , which was empty now that the livestock had been killed and eaten , they sniffed the spice-laden breezes that came from the shore , each pointing out new and exciting wonders to the other .</s>

<s>out came the journal and in it went Ann's own description of the scene : on each side of the Hoogli , where we are now sailing , are the Hindoo cottages , as thick together as the houses in our seaports .</s>

<s>they are very small , and in the form of haystacks , without either chimney or windows .</s>

<s>they are situated in the midst of trees , which hang over them , and appear truly romantick .</s>

<s>the grass and fields of rice are perfectly green , and herds of cattle are everywhere feeding on the banks of the river , and the natives are scattered about differently employed .</s>

<s>some are fishing , some driving the team , and many are sitting indolently on the banks of the river .</s>

<s>the pagodas we have passed are much larger than the houses .</s>

<s>Harriet was just as delighted .</s>

<s>where were the hardships she had expected ?</s>

<s>she was certain now that it would be no harder to bear her child here in such pleasant surroundings than at home in the big white house in Haverhill .</s>

<s>with childlike innocence she wrote of the Indians as walking with fruit and umbrellas in their hands , with the tawny children around them .</s>

<s>this is the most delightful trial I have ever had , she decided .</s>

<s>the Indians who came aboard ship to collect the mail also interested her greatly , even if she was suitably shocked , according to the customs of the society in which she had been reared , to find them naked , except a piece of cotton cloth wrapped around their middle .</s>

<s>at last they saw Calcutta , largest city of Bengal and the Caravan's destination .</s>

<s>founded August 24 , 1690 by Job Charnock of the East India Company , and commonly called The City of Palaces , it seemed a vast and elegant place to Ann Hasseltine Judson .</s>

<s>solid brick buildings painted dazzling white , large domes and tall , picturesque palms stretched as far as the eye could see , while the wharves and harbor were filled with tall-masted sailing ships .</s>

<s>the noise stunned her .</s>

<s>crowds flocked through the waterfront streets chattering loudly in their strange-sounding Bengali tongue .</s>

<s>Harriet's mouth watered with anticipation when after months of dreaming she sat down at last to her much-craved milk and fresh bread .</s>

<s>Ann , pleased to see her friend happy , was intrigued by the new fruits a friend of Captain Heard had sent on board for their enjoyment .</s>

<s>cautiously she sampled her first pineapple and another fruit whose taste she likened to that of a rich pear .</s>

<s>though she did not then know its name , this strange new fruit was a banana .</s>

<s>six the first act of Adoniram and Samuel on reaching Calcutta was to report at the police station , a necessity when landing in East India Company territory .</s>

<s>on the way they tried to discover all they could about Burma , and they were disturbed to find that Michael Symes's book had not presented an altogether true picture .</s>

<s>he had failed to realize that the Burmese were not really treating him as the important visitor he considered himself .</s>

<s>they were in fact quietly laughing at him , for their King wished to have nothing to do with the Western world .</s>

<s>when Captain John Gibault of Salem had visited Burma in 1793 his ship , the Astra , had been promptly commandeered and taken by her captors up the Irrawaddy River .</s>

<s>although after much trouble he did manage to get it back , he discovered there was no trade to be had .</s>

<s>all Captain Gibault took back to Salem were a few items for the town's East India Museum .</s>

<s>a year later another Salem ship returned from Burma with a cargo of gum lacquer which nobody wanted to buy .</s>

<s>after that Salem ships decided to bypass unfriendly Burma .</s>

<s>the Burmese appeared to have little knowledge of British power or any idea of trade .</s>

<s>they despised foreigners .</s>

<s>cruel Burmese governors could , on the slightest whim , take a man's life .</s>

<s>as for missionaries , even if they succeeded in getting into the country they probably would not be allowed to preach the Christian faith to the Burmans .</s>

<s>unspeakable tortures or even execution might well be their fate .</s>

<s>go back to America or any other place , well-meaning friends of Captain Heard advised them , but put thoughts of going to Burma out of your heads .</s>

<s>somewhat daunted , the two American missionaries reached the police station where they were questioned by a most unfriendly clerk .</s>

<s>when he discovered they had received from the Company's Court of Directors no permission to live in India , coupled with the fact that they were Americans who had been sent to Asia to convert the heathen , he became more belligerent than ever .</s>

<s>they explained that they desired only to stop in India until a ship traveling on to Burma could be found .</s>

<s>she describes , first , the imaginary reaction of a foreigner puzzled by this unseasonable exultation ;
he is answered by a confused , honest Englishman .</s>

<s>the reasons for the Whig joy on this occasion are found to be their expectation of regaining control of the government , their delight at the prospect of a new war , their hopes of having the Tories hanged , and so on .</s>

<s>as for the author of the Englishman , Mrs. Manley sarcastically deplores that the sole defense of the Protestant cause should be left to Ridpath , Dick Steele , and their Associates , with the Apostles of Young Man's Coffee-House .</s>

<s>another controversy typical of the war between the Englishman and the Examiner centered on Robert ( later Viscount ) Molesworth , a Whig leader in Ireland and a member of the Irish Privy Council .</s>

<s>on December 21 , the day that the Irish House of Commons petitioned for removal of Sir Constantine Phipps , their Tory Lord Chancellor , Molesworth reportedly made this remark on the defense of Phipps by Convocation : they that have turned the world upside down , are come hither also .</s>

<s>upon complaints from the Lower House of Convocation to the House of Lords , he was removed from the Privy Council , his remark having been represented as a blasphemous affront to the clergy .</s>

<s>Steele , who had earlier praised Molesworth in Tatler No.</s>

<s>189 , now defended him in Englishman No.</s>

<s>46 , depicting his removal as a setback to the Constitution .</s>

<s>on the other hand , Molesworth was naturally assailed in the Tory press .</s>

<s>Swift , in the Dublin edition of A Preface to the Bishop of Sarum's Introduction , indicated his feelings by including Molesworth , along with Toland , Tindal , and Collins , in the group of those who , like Burnet , are engaged in attacking all Convocations of the clergy .</s>

<s>in the same way he coupled Molesworth and Wharton in a letter to Archbishop King , and he had earlier described him as the worst of them in some Observations on the Irish Privy Council submitted to Oxford .</s>

<s>a month later , in The Publick Spirit Of The Whigs , he used Steele's defense of Molesworth as evidence of his disrespect for the clergy , calling Steele's position an affront to the whole Convocation of Ireland .</s>

<s>on this issue , then , as on so many in these months , Steele and Swift took rigidly opposed points of view .</s>

<s>in the early months of 1714 , the battle between Swift and Steele over the issue of the Succession entered its major phase .</s>

<s>the preliminaries ended with the publication of Steele's Crisis on January 19 , and from that point on the fight proceeded at a rapid pace .</s>

<s>in answer to The Crisis , Swift produced The Publick Spirit Of The Whigs , his most extensive and bitter attack on his old friend .</s>

<s>by this time , as we shall see , the Tories were already planning to punish Steele for his political writing by expelling him from the House of Commons .</s>

<s>despite his defense of himself in the final paper of the Englishman and in his speech before the House , their efforts were successful .</s>

<s>Steele lost his seat in Parliament , and his personal quarrel with Swift , by now a public issue , thus reached its climax .</s>

<s>of all the Whig tracts written in support of the Succession , The Crisis is perhaps the most significant .</s>

<s>certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate .</s>

<s>Hanoverian agents assisted in promoting circulation , said to have reached 40,000 , and if one may judge by the reaction of Swift and other government writers , the work must have had considerable impact .</s>

<s>Steele's main business here is to arouse public opinion to the immediate danger of a Stuart Restoration .</s>

<s>to this end , the first and longest section of the tract cites all the laws enacted since the Revolution to defend England against the Arbitrary Power of a Popish Prince .</s>

<s>in his comment on these laws Steele sounds all the usual notes of current Whig propaganda , ranging from a criticism of the Tory peace to an attack on the dismissal of Marlborough ;
but his principal theme is that the intrigues of the Tories , our Popish or Jacobite Party , pose an immediate threat to Church and State .</s>

<s>like Burnet , he deplores the indifference of the people in the face of the crisis .</s>

<s>treasonable books striking at the Hanoverian Succession , he complains , are allowed to pass unnoticed .</s>

<s>in this connection , Swift , too , is drawn in for attack : the author of The Conduct Of The Allies has dared to drop insinuations about altering the succession .</s>

<s>in his effort to stir the public from its lethargy , Steele goes so far as to list Catholic atrocities of the sort to be expected in the event of a Stuart Restoration , and , with rousing rhetoric , he asserts that the only preservation from these terrours is to be found in the laws he has so tediously cited .</s>

<s>it is no time , he writes , to talk with hints and innuendos , but openly and honestly to profess our sentiments before our enemies have compleated and put their designs in execution against us .</s>

<s>Steele apparently professed his sentiments in this book too openly and honestly for his own good , since the government was soon to use it as evidence against him in his trial before the House .</s>

<s>in the final issues of the Englishman , which ended just as the new session of Parliament began , he provided his enemies with still more ammunition .</s>

<s>for example , No.</s>

<s>56 printed the patent giving the Electoral Prince the title of Duke of Cambridge .</s>

<s>in a few months the Duke was to be the center of a controversy of some significance on the touchy question of the Protestant Succession .</s>

<s>at the order of the Dowager Electress , the Hanoverian agents , supported by the Whig leaders , demanded that a writ of summons be issued which would call the Duke to England to sit in Parliament , thus further insuring the succession by establishing a Hanoverian Prince in England before the Queen's death .</s>

<s>Anne was furious , and Bolingbroke advised that the request be refused .</s>

<s>Oxford , realizing that the law required the issuance of the writ , took the opposite view , for which the Queen never forgave him .</s>

<s>accordingly the request was granted , but the Elector himself , who had not been consulted by his mother , rejected the proposal and recalled his agent Schutz , whose impolitic handling of the affair had caused the Hanoverian interest to suffer and had made Oxford's dismissal more likely than ever .</s>

<s>Steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy for such a plan .</s>

<s>a few days after this Englishman appeared , Defoe reported to Oxford that Steele was expected to move in Parliament that the Duke be called over ;
Defoe then commented , if they could draw that young gentleman into their measures they would show themselves quickly , for they are not asham'd to say they want only a head to make a beginning .</s>

<s>the final issue of the Englishman , No.</s>

<s>57 for February 15 , ran to some length and was printed as a separate pamphlet , entitled The Englishman : being the close of the paper so-called .</s>

<s>Steele's purpose is to present a general defense of his political writing and a resume of the themes which had occupied him in the Englishman ;
but there is much here also which bears directly on his personal quarrel with Swift .</s>

<s>thus he complains , with considerable justice , that the Tory writers have resorted to libel instead of answering his arguments .</s>

<s>his birth , education , and fortune , he says , have all been ridiculed simply because he has spoken with the freedom of an Englishman , and he assures the reader that whoever talks with me , is speaking to a Gentleman born .</s>

<s>as notable examples of this abuse , he quotes passages from the Examiner , that destroyer of all things , and The Character of Richard Steele , which he here attributes to Swift .</s>

<s>though put in rather maudlin terms , Steele's defense of himself has a reasonable basis .</s>

<s>his point is simply that the Tories have showered him with personal satire , despite the fact that as a private subject he has a right to speak on political matters without affronting the prerogative of the Sovereign .</s>

<s>he claims , too , that his political convictions are simply those which are called Revolution Principles and which are accepted by moderate men in both parties .</s>

<s>the final section of this pamphlet is of special interest in a consideration of Steele's relations with Swift .</s>

<s>it purports to be a letter from Steele to a friend at court , who , in Miss Blanchard's opinion , could only be meant as Swift .</s>

<s>Steele first answers briefly the charges which his dear old Friend new converts ;
by this term he means to ridicule their professions of acting in the interest of the Church despite their own education and manner of life -- a gibe , in other words , at the Presbyterianism in Harley's family and at Bolingbroke's reputed impiety .</s>

<s>the Tory leaders , he insinuates , are cynically using the Church as a political by-word to increase party friction and keep themselves in power .</s>

<s>this is the principal point made in this final section of Englishman No.</s>

<s>57 , and it caps Steele's efforts in his other writing of these months to counteract the notion of the Tories as a Church Party supported by the body of the clergy .</s>

<s>next , Steele turns his attention to the Courtier he is addressing .</s>

<s>he explains that there are sometimes honorable courtiers , but that too often a man who succeeds at court does not hesitate to sacrifice his Sovereign and nation to his own avarice and ambition .</s>

<s>such , he implies , is the case with his friend , who is not really a new convert himself but merely a favorer of new converts .</s>

<s>if Jack the Courtier is really to be taken as Swift , the following remark is obviously Steele's comment on Swift's change of parties and its effect on their friendship : I assure you , dear Jack , when I first found out such an allay in you , as makes you of so malleable a constitution , that you may be worked into any form an artificer pleases , I foresaw I should not enjoy your favour much longer .</s>

<s>he closes his letter by demanding that Dunkirk be demolished , that the Pretender be forced to move farther away from the coast of England , and that the Queen and the House of Hanover come to a better understanding .</s>

<s>the last point was soon to be included in the seditious remarks used against him in Parliament .</s>

<s>the Examiner , during Steele's trial a month later , printed an answer from the Courtier addressed to R. S. at Button's coffee-house .</s>

<s>he reviews Steele's entrance into politics and finds that his present difficulties are due to his habit of attributing to his own abilities and talents achievements which more properly should be credited to the indulgence of his friends .</s>

<s>once more , in other words , Steele is said to be indebted to Swift for his wit ;
this was the form in which their private feud most often appeared in the Tory press , especially the Examiner .</s>

<s>in the publick spirit of the Whigs , it may be noted , Swift himself contemptuously dismissed Steele's reference to his friend at court : I suppose by the style of old Friend , and the like , it must be some body there of his own level ;
among whom , his party have indeed more Friends than I could wish .</s>

<s>on February 16 , Steele took his seat in Parliament .</s>

<s>by now he was undergoing a fresh torrent of abuse from Tory papers and pamphlets , and action was being taken to effect his punishment by expulsion from Parliament .</s>

<s>on the very day that the parliamentary session began , another infamous libel appeared , entitled A Letter From The Facetious Dr. Andrew Tripe , At Bath , To The Venerable Nestor Ironside .</s>

<s>it is filled with the usual personal abuse of Steele , especially of his physical appearance ;
in the opening paragraph , too , Steele is accused of extreme egotism , of giving himself the preference to all the learned , his contemporaries , from Dr.</s>

<s>Swift himself , even down to Poet Cr--spe of the Customhouse .</s>

<s>when Harold Arlen returned to California in the winter of 1944 , it was to take up again a collaboration with Johnny Mercer , begun some years before .</s>

<s>the film they did after his return was an inconsequential bit of nothing titled Out Of This World , a satire on the Sinatra bobby-soxer craze .</s>

<s>the twist lay in using Bing Crosby's voice on the sound track while leading man Eddie Bracken mouthed the words .</s>

<s>if nothing else , at least two good songs came out of the project , Out Of This World and June Comes Around Every Year .</s>

<s>though they would produce some very memorable and lasting songs , Arlen and Mercer were not given strong material to work on .</s>

<s>their first collaboration came close .</s>

<s>early in 1941 they were assigned to a script titled Hot Nocturne .</s>

<s>it purported to be a reasonably serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians , their aims , their problems -- the tug-of-war between the pure and the commercial -- and seemed a promising vehicle , for the two men shared a common interest in jazz .</s>

<s>Johnny Mercer practically grew up with the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears .</s>

<s>he was born in Savannah , Georgia , in 1909 .</s>

<s>his father , George A. Mercer , was descended from an honored Southern family that could trace its ancestry back to one Hugh Mercer , who had emigrated from Scotland in 1747 .</s>

<s>the lyricist's father was a lawyer who had branched out into real estate .</s>

<s>his second wife , Lillian , was the mother of John H. Mercer .</s>

<s>by the age of six young Johnny indicated that he had the call .</s>

<s>one day he followed the Irish Jasper Greens , the town band , to a picnic and spent the entire day listening , while his family spent the day looking .</s>

<s>the disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time maid to keeping an eye on the boy .</s>

<s>but one afternoon Mrs. Mercer met her ;
both were obviously on the way to the Mercer home .</s>

<s>the mother inquired , where's Johnny , and why did you leave him ?</s>

<s>there was nothing else I could do , the maid answered , satisfied with a rather vague explanation .</s>

<s>but Mrs. Mercer demanded more .</s>

<s>the maid then told her , because he fired me .</s>

<s>with her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little else but get him started on the study of music -- though she waited until he was ten -- beginning with the piano and following that with the trumpet .</s>

<s>young Mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for both instruments .</s>

<s>still , he did like music making and even sang in the chapel choir of the Woodberry Forest School , near Orange , Virginia , where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well .</s>

<s>when he was fifteen John H. Mercer turned out his first song , a jazzy little thing he called Sister Susie , Strut Your Stuff .</s>

<s>if his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have been , Mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect .</s>

<s>from his playmates in Savannah , Mercer had picked up , along with a soft Southern dialect , traces also of the Gullah dialects of Africa .</s>

<s>such speech differences made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language .</s>

<s>during the summers , while he was still in school , Mercer worked for his father's firm as a messenger boy .</s>

<s>it generally took well into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer's help .</s>

<s>we'd give him things to deliver , letters , checks , deeds and things like that , remembers his half-brother Walter , still in the real estate business in Savannah , and learn days later that he'd absent-mindedly stuffed them into his pocket .</s>

<s>there they stayed .</s>

<s>this rather detached attitude toward life's encumbrances has seemed to be the dominant trait in Mercer's personality ever since .</s>

<s>it is , however , a disarming disguise , or perhaps a shield , for not only has Mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the years , but also one who can function remarkably under pressure .</s>

<s>he has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer ( his records have sold in the millions ) and is a sharp businessman .</s>

<s>he has also an extraordinary conscience .</s>

<s>in 1927 his father's business collapsed , and , rather than go bankrupt , Mercer senior turned his firm over to a bank for liquidation .</s>

<s>he died before he could completely pay off his debts .</s>

<s>some years later the bank handling the Mercer liquidation received a check for $300,000 , enough to clear up the debt .</s>

<s>the check had been mailed from Chicago , the envelope bore no return address , and the check was not signed .</s>

<s>that's Johnny , sighed the bank president , the best-hearted boy in the world , but absent-minded .</s>

<s>but Mercer's explanation was simple : I made out the check and carried it around a few days unsigned -- in case I lost it .</s>

<s>when he remembered that he might have not signed the check , Mercer made out another for the same amount , instructing the bank to destroy the other -- especially if he had happened to have absent-mindedly signed both of them .</s>

<s>when the family business failed , Mercer left school and on his mother's urging -- for she hoped that he would become an actor -- he joined a local little theater group .</s>

<s>when the troupe traveled to New York to participate in a one-act-play competition -- and won -- Mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in triumph , remained in New York .</s>

<s>he had talked one other member of the group to stay with him , but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to Savannah .</s>

<s>but Mercer hung on , living , after a fashion , in a Greenwich Village fourth-flight walk-up .</s>

<s>the place had no sink or washbasin , only a bathtub , his mother discovered when she visited him .</s>

<s>Johnny insisted on cooking a chicken dinner in my honor -- he's always been a good cook -- and I'll never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub .</s>

<s>a story , no doubt apocryphal , for Mercer himself denies it , has him sporting a monacle in those Village days .</s>

<s>though merely clear glass , it was a distinctive trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint himself upon the memories of producers .</s>

<s>one day in a bar , so the legend goes , someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monacle and broke it .</s>

<s>the innocent malfeasant , filled with that supreme sense of honor found in bars , insisted upon replacing the destroyed monacle -- and did , over the protests of the former owner -- with a square monacle .</s>

<s>Mercer is supposed to have refused it with , anyone who wears a square monacle must be affected ]
Everett Miller , then assistant director for the Garrick Gaieties , a Theatre Guild production , needed a lyricist for a song he had written ;
he just happened not to need any actor at the moment , however .</s>

<s>for him Mercer produced the lyric to Out Of Breath Scared To Death Of You , introduced in that most successful of all the Gaieties , by Sterling Holloway .</s>

<s>this 1930 edition also had songs in it by Vernon Duke and Ira Gershwin , by E. Y. Harburg and Duke , and by Harry Myers .</s>

<s>entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged the burgeoning song writer to take a wife , Elizabeth Meehan , a dancer in the Gaieties .</s>

<s>the Mercers took up residence in Brooklyn , and Mercer found a regular job in Wall Street misplacing stocks and bonds .</s>

<s>when he heard that Paul Whiteman was looking for singers to replace the Rhythm Boys , Mercer applied and got the job , not for my voice , I'm sure , but because I could write songs and material generally .</s>

<s>while with the Whiteman band Mercer met Jerry Arlen .</s>

<s>he had yet to meet Harold Arlen , for although they had collaborated on Satan's Li'l Lamb , Mercer and Harburg had worked from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them .</s>

<s>the lyric , Mercer remembers , was tailored to fit the unusual melody .</s>

<s>Mercer's Whiteman association brought him into contact with Hoagy Carmichael , whose Snowball Mercer relyriced as Lazybones , in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning of Mercer's song-writing career .</s>

<s>after leaving Whiteman , Mercer joined the Benny Goodman band as a vocalist .</s>

<s>with the help of Ziggy Elman , also in the band , he transformed a traditional Jewish melody into a popular song , And The Angels Sing .</s>

<s>the countrywide success of Lazybones and And The Angels Sing could only lead to Hollywood , where , besides Harold Arlen , Mercer collaborated with Harry Warren , Jimmy Van Heusen , Richard Whiting , Walter Donaldson , Jerome Kern , and Arthur Schwartz .</s>

<s>Mercer has also written both music and lyrics for several songs .</s>

<s>he may be the only song writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the U. S. Treasury ;
he collaborated on a song with William Hartman Woodin , who was Secretary of the Treasury , 1932-33 .</s>

<s>when Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen began their collaboration in 1940 , Mercer , like Arlen , had several substantial film songs to his credit , among them Hooray For Hollywood , Ride , Tenderfoot , Ride , Have You Got Any Castles , Baby ?</s>

<s>, and Too Marvelous For Words ( all with Richard Whiting ) ;
with Harry Warren he did The Girl Friend Of The Whirling Dervish , Jeepers Creepers , and You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby .</s>

<s>Mercer's lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuances , a puckish sense of humor expressed in language with a colloquial flair .</s>

<s>though versatile and capable of turning out a ballad lyric with the best of them , Mercer's forte is a highly polished quasi-folk wit .</s>

<s>his casual , dreamlike working methods , often as not in absentia , were an abrupt change from Harburg's , so that Arlen had to adjust again to another approach to collaboration .</s>

<s>there were times that he worked with both lyricists simultaneously .</s>

<s>speaking of his work with Johnny Mercer , Arlen says , our working habits were strange .</s>

<s>after we got a script and the spots for the songs were blocked out , we'd get together for an hour or so every day .</s>

<s>while Johnny made himself comfortable on the couch , I'd play the tunes for him .</s>

<s>he has a wonderfully retentive memory .</s>

<s>after I would finish playing the songs , he'd just go away without a comment .</s>

<s>I wouldn't hear from him for a couple of weeks , then he'd come around with the completed lyric .</s>

<s>Arlen is one of the few ( possibly the only ) composer Mercer has been able to work with so closely , for they held their meetings in Arlen's study .</s>

<s>some guys bothered me , Mercer has said .</s>

<s>I couldn't write with them in the same room with me , but I could with Harold .</s>

<s>he is probably our most original composer ;
he often uses very odd rhythms , which makes it difficult , and challenging , for the lyric writer .</s>

<s>while Arlen and Mercer collaborated on Hot Nocturne , Mercer worked also with Arthur Schwartz on another film , Navy Blues .</s>

<s>Arlen , too , worked on other projects at the same time with old friend Ted Koehler .</s>

<s>besides doing a single song , When The Sun Comes Out , they worked on the ambitious American-Negro Suite , for voices and piano , as well as songs for films .</s>

<s>the American-Negro Suite is in a sense an extension of the Cotton Club songs in that it is a collection of Negro songs , not for a night club , but for the concert stage .</s>

<s>the work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight-bar musical strain to which Koehler set the words there'll be no more work ;
there'll be no more worry , matching the spiritual feeling of the jot .</s>

<s>this grew into the song Big Time Comin' .</s>

<s>by September 1940 the Suite had developed into a collection of six songs , four spirituals , a dream , and a lullaby .</s>

<s>the Negro composer Hall Johnson studied the American-Negro Suite and said of it , of all the many songs written by white composers and employing what claims to be a Negroid idiom in both words and music , these six songs by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler easily stand far out above the rest .</s>

<s>thoroughly modern in treatment , they are at the same time , full of simple sincerity which invariably characterizes genuine Negro folk-music and are by no means to be confused with the average Broadway Spirituals which depend for their racial flavor upon sundry allusions to the Amen Corner , Judgement Day , Gabriel's Horn , and a frustrated devil -- with a few random hallelujahs thrown in for good measure .</s>

<s>I feel obliged to describe this cubbyhole .</s>

<s>it had a single porcelain stall and but one cabinet for the chairing of the bards .</s>

<s>it was here that the terror-stricken Dennis Moon played an unrehearsed role during the children's party .</s>

<s>a much larger room , adjacent to the lavatory , served as a passageway to and from the skimpy toilet .</s>

<s>that unused room was large enough for -- well , say an elephant could get into it and , as a matter of fact , an elephant did .</s>

<s>something occurred on the morning of the children's party which may illustrate the kind of trouble our restricted toilet facilities caused us .</s>

<s>it so happened that sports writer Arthur Robinson got out of the hospital that morning after promising his doctor that he be back in an hour or two to continue his convalescence .</s>

<s>Arthur Robinson traveled with the baseball clubs as staff correspondent for the American .</s>

<s>he was ghost writer for Babe Ruth , whose main talent for literary composition was the signing of his autograph .</s>

<s>Robbie was a war veteran with battle-shattered knees .</s>

<s>he arrived on crutches at the Newspaper Club with one of his great pals , Oliver Herford , artist , author , and foe of stupidity .</s>

<s>Mr. Herford's appearance was that of a frustrated gnome .</s>

<s>he seemed timid ( at first , ) wore nose glasses from which a black ribbon dangled , and was no bigger than a jockey .</s>

<s>Robinson asked Herford to escort him to the club's lavatory before they sat down for a highball and a game of cards .</s>

<s>in the jakes , after Robbie and his crutches were properly stowed , Mr. Herford went to the adjoining facility .</s>

<s>he had barely assumed his stance there when a fat fellow charged through the doorway .</s>

<s>without any regard for rest-room protocol , the hulking stranger almost knocked Herford off his pins .</s>

<s>the artist-author said nothing , but stood to one side .</s>

<s>he waited a long time .</s>

<s>nothing was said , nothing accomplished .</s>

<s>the unrelieved stranger eventually turned away from the place of his -- shall we dare say his Waterloo ?</s>

<s>-- to go to the door .</s>

<s>Mr. Herford touched the fat man's arm .</s>

<s>pardon me , sir .</s>

<s>may I say that you have just demonstrated the truth of an old proverb -- the younger Pliny's , if memory serves me -- which , translated freely from the archaic Latin , says , the more haste , the less peed .</s>

<s>Governor Alfred E. Smith was the official host at the children's party .</s>

<s>United States Senator Royal S. Copeland was wearing the robes of Santa Claus and a great white beard ;
the Honorable Robert Wagner , Sr. , at that time a justice of the New York Supreme Court , was on the reception committee .</s>

<s>I was in charge of the arrangements -- which were soon enough disarranged .</s>

<s>I had had difficulties from the very first day .</s>

<s>when , in my enthusiasm , I proposed the party , my city editor ( who disliked the club and many of its members ) tried to block my participation in the gala event .</s>

<s>even earlier than that he had resented the fact that I had been chosen to edit the club's Reporter .</s>

<s>city editor Victor Watson of the New York American was a man of brooding suspicions and mysterious shifts of mood .</s>

<s>Mr. Hearst's telegraphic code word for Victor Watson was fatboy .</s>

<s>the staff saw in him the qualities of a Don Cossack , hence , as mentioned before , his nickname the Hetman .</s>

<s>the Hetman's physical aspects were not those of a savage rider of the steppes .</s>

<s>indeed , he looked more like a well-fleshed lay brother of the Hospice of St. Bernard .</s>

<s>nor were his manners barbaric .</s>

<s>he had a purring voice and poker player's immobility of features which somehow conveyed the feeling that he knew where all the bodies were buried .</s>

<s>he was the son of a Scottish father and an American Jewish mother , long widowed , with whom he lived in a comfortable home in Flushing .</s>

<s>he had worked in the newspaper business since he was nineteen years old , always for the Hearst service .</s>

<s>from the very first he regarded himself as Mr. Hearst's disciple , defender , and afterward his prime minister , self-ordained .</s>

<s>it was said that the Hetman plotted to take over the entire Hearst newspaper empire one day by means of various coups : the destruction of editors who tried to halt his course , the unfrocking of publishers whose mistakes of judgment might be magnified in secret reports to Mr. Hearst .</s>

<s>whatever the Hetman's ambitions , his colleagues were kept ill at ease .</s>

<s>among the outstanding members of the Hearst cabinet whom he successfully opposed for a time were the great Arthur Brisbane , Bradford Merrill , S.S. Carvalho , and Colonel Van Hamm .</s>

<s>he also disliked Runyon , for no good reason other than the fact that the Demon's talent was so marked as to put him well beyond the Hetman's say-so or his supervision .</s>

<s>Runyon , for his part , had a contemptuous regard for Mr. Watson .</s>

<s>he's a wrong-o , said Runyon , and I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw the Statue of Liberty .</s>

<s>Arthur Bugs Baer wrote to me just recently , Vic wanted to die in harness , with his head towards the wagon .</s>

<s>he supported his mother and his brother , who afterwards committed suicide .</s>

<s>Watson told me that his brother always sent roses to his mother , blossoms bought with Vic's allowance to him .</s>

<s>and would you believe it , Vic added , she likes him better than she does me .</s>

<s>why ?</s>

<s>about the only time the Hetman seemed excited was when one of his own pet ideas was born .</s>

<s>then he would get to his feet , as though rising in honor of his own remarkable powers , and say almost invariably , Gentlemen , this is an amazing story ]
it's bigger than the Armistice .</s>

<s>some of the Hetman's ideas were dream-ridden , vaguely imparted , and at times preposterous .</s>

<s>one day he assigned me to lay bare a plot by the Duponts to supply munitions to a wholly fictitious revolution he said was about to occur in Cuba .</s>

<s>he said that his information was so secret that he would not be able to confide in me the origin of his pipeline tip .</s>

<s>I can tell you this much , he said .</s>

<s>it's bigger than the Armistice .</s>

<s>I worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment and consulted several of my own well-informed sources .</s>

<s>then I spent the next two days at the baseball park and at Jack Doyle's pool parlors .</s>

<s>when I returned to make my report , the Hetman did not remember having sent me on the secret mission .</s>

<s>he was busy , he said , in having someone submit to a monkey-gland operation .</s>

<s>and I was to go to work on that odd matter .</s>

<s>I shall tell of it later on .</s>

<s>the Hetman had a strong liking for a story , any story which was to be had by means of much sleuthing or by roundabout methods .</s>

<s>most of my stories were obtained by simply seeking out the person who could give me the facts , and not as a rule by playing clever tricks .</s>

<s>one day I tired of following the Hetman's advice of shadowing and of the ring-around-the-rosie approach to a report that Enrico Caruso had pinched a lady's hip while visiting the Central Park monkey house .</s>

<s>I explained my state of mind to artist Winsor McCay and to Bugs Baer .</s>

<s>Mr. Baer obtained a supply of crepe hair and spirit-gum from an actor at the Friars .</s>

<s>we fashioned beards , put them on , and reported to the Hetman at the city desk .</s>

<s>Mr. Baer had an auburn beard , like Longfellow's .</s>

<s>Mr. McCay had on a sort of Emperor Maximilian beard and mustache .</s>

<s>as for myself , I had on an enormous black muff .</s>

<s>this , together with a derby hat and horn-rim eyeglasses , gave me the appearance of a Russian nihilist .</s>

<s>we are ready for your next mysterious assignment , said Mr. Baer to the Hetman .</s>

<s>where to , sir ?</s>

<s>Mr. Watson did not have much humor in his make-up , but he managed a mirthless smile .</s>

<s>just then a reporter telephoned in from the Bronx to give the rewrite desk an account of a murder .</s>

<s>the Hetman told me to take the story over the phone and to write it .</s>

<s>while I was sitting at one of the rewrite telephones with my derby and my great beard , Arthur Brisbane whizzed in with some editorial copy in his hand .</s>

<s>he paused for a moment to look at me , then went on to the city desk to deliver his Today column .</s>

<s>I thought it expedient to take off my derby , my glasses , and the beard ;
and also to change telephones .</s>

<s>I managed to do this by the time the great A.B.</s>

<s>returned to the place where he last had seen the fierce nihilist .</s>

<s>he stood there staring with disbelief at the vacant desk .</s>

<s>then he wrinkled his huge brow and went slowly out of the room .</s>

<s>he had a somewhat goggle-eyed expression .</s>

<s>he had been seeing things .</s>

<s>the Hetman's ideas for news stories or editorial campaigns were by no means always fruitless or lacking in merit .</s>

<s>he campaigned successfully for the riddance of Death Avenue and also brought about the ending of pollution of metropolitan beaches by sewage .</s>

<s>he exposed the bucket-shop racket with the able assistance of two excellent reporters , Nat Ferber and Carl Helm .</s>

<s>in the conduct of these and many other campaigns , the Hetman proved to be a much abler journalist than his critics allowed .</s>

<s>it seems to me now , in a long backward glance , that many of the Hetman's conceits and odd actions -- together with his grim posture when brandishing the hatchet in the name of Mr. Hearst -- were keyed with the tragedy which was to close over him one day .</s>

<s>alone , rejected on every hand , divorced , and in financial trouble , he leaped from an eleventh-floor window of the Abbey Hotel in 1937 .</s>

<s>one finds it difficult to pass censure on the lonely figure who waited for days for a saving word from his zealously served idol , W.R. Hearst .</s>

<s>that word was withheld when the need of it seemed the measure of his despair .</s>

<s>the unfinished note , written in pencil upon the back of a used envelope , and addressed to the coroner , makes one wonder about many things : God forgive me for everything .</s>

<s>I cannot much to Damon Runyon's amazement , as well as my own , I got along splendidly with the Hetman ;
that is , until I became an editor , hence , in his eyes , a rival .</s>

<s>not long after Colonel Van Hamm had foisted me on the Watson staff I received a salary raise and a contract on the Hetman's recommendation .</s>

<s>during the next years he gave me the second of the five contracts I would sign with the Hearst Service .</s>

<s>it was a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to have a contract in those days before the epidemic of syndicated columnists .</s>

<s>I would like to believe that my ability warranted this advancement .</s>

<s>somehow I think that Watson paid more attention to me than he otherwise might have because his foe , Colonel Van Hamm , wouldn't touch me with a ten-foot blue pencil .</s>

<s>I remember one day when Mr. Hearst ( and I never knew why he liked me , either ) sent the Hetman a telegram : please find some more reporters like that young man from Denver .</s>

<s>Watson showed this wire to Colonel Van Hamm .</s>

<s>the colonel grunted , then made a remark which might be construed in either of two ways .</s>

<s>don't bother to look any further .</s>

<s>we already have the only one of its kind .</s>

<s>the Hetman did have friends , but they were mostly outside the newspaper profession .</s>

<s>Sergeant Mike Donaldson , Congressional Medal of Honor soldier , was one of them .</s>

<s>Dr. Menas S. Gregory was another .</s>

<s>I used to go with Watson to call on the eminent neurologist at his apartment , to sit among the doctor's excellent collection of statues , paintings , and books and drink Oriental coffee while Watson seemed to thaw out and become almost affable .</s>

<s>there was one time , however , when his face clouded and he suddenly blurted , why did my brother commit suicide ?</s>

<s>I cannot remember Dr. Gregory's reply , if , indeed , he made one .</s>

<s>if she were not at home , Mama would see to it that a fresh white rose was there .</s>

<s>sometimes , Mrs. Coolidge would close herself in the Green Suite on the second floor , and play the piano she had brought to the White House .</s>

<s>Mama knew she was playing her son's favorite pieces and feeling close to him , and did not disturb her .</s>

<s>all the rest of the days in the White House would be shadowed by the tragic loss , even though the President tried harder than ever to make his little dry jokes and to tease the people around him .</s>

<s>a little boy came to give the President his personal condolences , and the President gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in .</s>

<s>backstairs , the maids cried a little over that , and the standing invitation was not mentioned to Mrs. Coolidge .</s>

<s>the President was even more generous with the First Lady than he had been before the tragedy .</s>

<s>he would bring her boxes of candy and other presents to coax a smile to her lips .</s>

<s>he brought her shawls .</s>

<s>dresses were short in the days of Mrs. Coolidge , and Spanish shawls were thrown over them .</s>

<s>he got her dozens of them .</s>

<s>one shawl was so tremendous that she could not wear it , so she draped it over the banister on the second floor , and it hung over the stairway .</s>

<s>the President used to look at it with a ghost of a smile .</s>

<s>Mrs. Coolidge spent more time in her bedroom among her doll collection .</s>

<s>she kept the dolls on the Lincoln bed .</s>

<s>at night , when Mama would turn back the covers , she would have to take all the dolls off the bed and place them elsewhere for the night .</s>

<s>Mama always felt that the collection symbolized Mrs. Coolidge's wish for a little girl .</s>

<s>among the dolls was one that meant very much to the First Lady , who would pick it up and look at it often .</s>

<s>it had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist .</s>

<s>an accompanying sympathetic letter explained that inside the envelope was a name for Mrs. Coolidge's first granddaughter .</s>

<s>Mama knew this doll was meant to help Mrs. Coolidge overcome her grief by turning her eyes to the future .</s>

<s>the name inside the envelope was Cynthia .</s>

<s>the Coolidges' life , after the death of their son , was quieter than ever .</s>

<s>John was away at school most of the time .</s>

<s>Mrs. Coolidge would knit , and the President would sit reading , or playing with the many pets around them .</s>

<s>now and then , the President would call for Little Jack , Master of the Hounds , which was his nickname for a messenger who had worked in the White House since Teddy Roosevelt's administration , and discuss the welfare of some one of the animals .</s>

<s>it was part of Little Jack's work to look after the dogs .</s>

<s>one White House dog was immortalized in a painting .</s>

<s>that was Rob Roy , who posed with Mrs. Coolidge for the portrait by Howard Chandler Christy .</s>

<s>to get him to pose , Mrs. Coolidge would feed him candy , so he enjoyed the portrait sessions as well as she did .</s>

<s>I would like to straighten out a misconception about the dress Mrs. Coolidge is wearing in this painting .</s>

<s>it is not the same dress as the one on her manikin in the Smithsonian .</s>

<s>people think the dress in the picture was lengthened by an artist much later on .</s>

<s>this is not true .</s>

<s>the dress in the painting is a bright red , with rhinestones forming a spray on the right side .</s>

<s>there is a long train flowing from the shoulders .</s>

<s>Mrs. Coolidge gave Mama this dress for me , and I wore it many times .</s>

<s>I still have the dress , and I hope to give it to the Smithsonian Institution as a memento , or , as I more fondly hope , to present it to a museum containing articles showing the daily lives of the Presidents -- if I can get it organized .</s>

<s>but to get back to the Coolidge household , Mrs. Coolidge so obviously loved dogs , that the public sent her more dogs -- Calamity Jane , Timmy , and Blackberry .</s>

<s>the last two were a red and a black chow .</s>

<s>Rob Roy remained boss of all the dogs .</s>

<s>he showed them what to do , and taught them how to keep the maids around the White House in a state of terror .</s>

<s>the dogs would run through the halls after him like a burst of bullets , and all the maids would run for cover .</s>

<s>Mama didn't know what to do -- whether to tell on Rob Roy or not -- since she had the ear of Mrs. Coolidge more than the other maids .</s>

<s>but she was afraid the First Lady would not understand , because Rob Roy was a perfect angel with the First Family .</s>

<s>every day , when the President took his nap , Rob Roy would stretch out on the window seat near him , like a perfect gentleman , and stare thoughtfully out the window , or he would take a little nap himself .</s>

<s>he would not make a sound until the President had wakened and left for the office ;
then he would bark to let everyone know the coast was clear .</s>

<s>his signal was for the other dogs to come running , but it was also the signal for Mama and the other maids to watch out .</s>

<s>Rob Roy was self-appointed to accompany the President to his office every morning .</s>

<s>Rob Roy was well aware of the importance of this mission , and he would walk in front of the President , looking neither to the right nor to the left .</s>

<s>at dinner , lunch , or breakfast , the President would call out , supper ]
-- he called all meals supper -- after the butler had announced the meal .</s>

<s>all the dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the President and go to the dining room .</s>

<s>they would all lie around on the rug during the meal , a very pretty sight as Rob Roy , Prudence , and Calamity Jane were all snow-white .</s>

<s>when Prudence and Blackberry were too young to be trusted in the dining room , they were tied to the radiator with their leashes , and they would cry .</s>

<s>Mama tried to talk to them and keep them quiet while she tidied up the sitting room before the First Family returned .</s>

<s>finally , Mama did mention to Mrs. Coolidge that she felt sorry for the little dogs , and then Mrs. Coolidge decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone , even though her husband disapproved of the waste of electricity .</s>

<s>Mama was now the first maid to Mrs. Coolidge , because Catherine , the previous first maid , had become ill and died .</s>

<s>Mrs. Coolidge chose Mama in her place .</s>

<s>it was a high mark for Mama .</s>

<s>every First Family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship .</s>

<s>for the Coolidges , it was Mr. and Mrs. Frank W. Stearns of Boston , Massachusetts , owners of a large department store .</s>

<s>they seemed to be at the White House half the time .</s>

<s>the butlers were amused because when the Stearns were there , the President would say grace at breakfast .</s>

<s>if the Stearns were not there , grace would be omitted .</s>

<s>speaking of breakfast , the President inaugurated a new custom -- that of conducting business at the breakfast table .</s>

<s>the word was that this too was part of an economy move on his part .</s>

<s>a new bill had been passed under Harding that designated the Government , rather than the President , as the tab-lifter for official meals .</s>

<s>so the President would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting Government officials to attend .</s>

<s>he caused a lot of talk when he also chose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair while he ate .</s>

<s>Mama said that if Presidents were supposed to be colorful , Mr. Coolidge certainly made a good president .</s>

<s>he knew exactly how to be colorful ]
the favorite guest of the house , as far as the staff was concerned , was Mr. Wrigley , the chewing gum king .</s>

<s>the White House had chewing gum until it could chew no more , and every Christmas , Mr. Wrigley sent the President a check for $100 , to be divided among all the help .</s>

<s>you can imagine that he got pretty good service .</s>

<s>another good friend of the Coolidges' was George B. Harvey , who was the Ambassador to Great Britain from 1921 to 1923 .</s>

<s>he had been a friend of the Hardings , and continued to be invited by the Coolidges .</s>

<s>the first royalty whom Mama ever waited on in the White House was Queen Marie of Rumania , who came to a State dinner given in her honor on October 21 , 1926 .</s>

<s>she was not an overnight guest in the White House , but Mr. Ike Hoover , the chief usher , had Mama check her fur coat when she came in , and take care of her needs .</s>

<s>Mama said she was one of the prettiest ladies she had ever seen .</s>

<s>Mama was very patriotic , and one of the duties she was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag that flew above the White House .</s>

<s>actually , two flags were used at the mansion -- a small one on rainy days , and a big one on bright days .</s>

<s>the wool would become frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind , and Mama would mend it .</s>

<s>she would often go up on the roof to see the attendant take down the flag in the evening .</s>

<s>she used to tell me , when I stand there and look at the flag blowing this way and that way , I have the wonderful , safe feeling that Americans are protected no matter which way the wind blows .</s>

<s>even when Mrs. Coolidge was in mourning for her son , she reached out to help other people in trouble .</s>

<s>one person she helped was my brother .</s>

<s>Mama had told her how Emmett's lungs had been affected when he was gassed in the war .</s>

<s>he was in and out of Mount Alto Hospital for veterans any number of times .</s>

<s>taking a personal interest , she had the doctor assigned to the White House , Dr. James Coupal , look Emmett over .</s>

<s>as a result , he was sent to a hospital in Arizona until his health improved enough for him to come back to Washington to work in the Government service .</s>

<s>but again , there was danger that his lungs would suffer in the muggy Washington weather , and he had to return to the dry climate of the West to live and work .</s>

<s>when Mrs. Coolidge was in mourning , she did not wear black .</s>

<s>she wore grey every day , and white every evening .</s>

<s>Mama knew that she was out of mourning when she finally wore bright colors .</s>

<s>the President helped her a lot by selecting some lovely colored dresses to get her started .</s>

<s>she opened the boxes with a tear in her eye and a sad smile on her face .</s>

<s>on the social side , the chore Mama had at the formal receptions at the White House thrilled her the most .</s>

<s>it was her job to stand at the foot of the stairs , and , just as the First Lady stepped off the last tread , Mama would straighten out her long train before she marched to the Blue Room to greet her guests with the President .</s>

<s>Mama would enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone , and would note a gown here and there to tell me about that night .</s>

<s>one night , Mama came home practically in a state of shock .</s>

<s>she had stood at the bottom of the stairs , as usual , when Mrs. Coolidge came down , in the same dress that is now in the Smithsonian , to greet her guests .</s>

<s>Mama stooped down to fix the train , but there was no train there ]
she reached and reached around the dress , but there was nothing there .</s>

<s>she looked up and saw that , without knowing it , Mrs. Coolidge was holding it aloft .</s>

<s>Mrs. Coolidge looked down , saw Mama's horrified expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor .</s>

<s>Mama swirled the train in place , and not a step was lost .</s>

<s>the Coolidges did not always live at the White House during the Presidency .</s>

<s>impressive as this enumeration is , it barely hints at the diverse perceptions of Jews , collectively or individually , that have been attested by their Gentile environment .</s>

<s>it is reasonable to affirm two propositions : Jews have been perceived by non-Jews as all things to all men ;
some Jews have in fact been all things to all men .</s>

<s>in the arena of power Jews have at one time or another been somebody's ally ;
they have observed correct neutrality ;
they have been someone's enemy .</s>

<s>in the market place Jews have in fact under various circumstances been valued customers and suppliers , or clannish monopolists and cutthroat competitors .</s>

<s>and so on through the roles referred to in the previous paragraph .</s>

<s>diversity of perception , yes ;
diversity of fact , yes .</s>

<s>but the two do not invariably or even typically coincide .</s>

<s>the conventional image of a particular time and place is not necessarily congruent with the image of the facts as established over the years by scholarly and scientific research .</s>

<s>conventional images of Jews have this in common with all perceptions of a configuration in which one feature is held constant : images can be both true and false .</s>

<s>the genuinely interesting question , then , becomes : what factors determine the degree of realism or distortion in conventional images of Jews ?</s>

<s>the working test of the facts must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation to relevant situations .</s>

<s>granted , such functional images are subject to human error ;
they are self-correcting in the sense that they are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against error .</s>

<s>in accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors can be usefully distinguished : current intelligence ;
predispositions regarding intelligence .</s>

<s>General Grant may have been the victim of false information in the instance reported in this book ;
if so , he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed to bad information and dubious estimates of the future .</s>

<s>but General Grant may have been self-victimized .</s>

<s>he may have entered the situation with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the press of affairs .</s>

<s>predispositions , in turn , fall conveniently into two categories for purposes of analysis .</s>

<s>to some extent predispositions are shaped by exposure to group environments .</s>

<s>in some measure they depend upon the structure of individual personality .</s>

<s>the anti-Semitism of Hitler owed something to his exposure to the ideology of Lueger's politically successful Christian socialist movement in Vienna .</s>

<s>but millions of human beings were exposed to Lueger's propaganda and record .</s>

<s>after allowing for group exposures , it is apparent that other factors must be considered if we are to comprehend fanaticism .</s>

<s>these are personality factors ;
they include harmonies and conflicts within the whole man , and mechanisms whereby inner components are more or less smoothly met .</s>

<s>modern psychiatric knowledge provides us with many keys to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind .</s>

<s>the foregoing factors are pertinent to the analysis of perceptual images and the broad conditions under which they achieve realism or fall short of it .</s>

<s>undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of Gentile conceptions of the Jew unfolded in the present anthology is that it provides a formidable body of material that invites critical examination in terms of reality .</s>

<s>many selections are themselves convincing contributions to this appraisal .</s>

<s>undoubtedly , however , the significance of the volume is greater than the foregoing paragraphs suggest .</s>

<s>speaking as a non-Jew I believe that its primary contribution is in the realm of future policy .</s>

<s>since we can neither undo nor redo the past , we are limited to the events of today and tomorrow .</s>

<s>in this domain the simple fact of coexistence in the same local , national , and world community is enough to guarantee that we cannot refrain from having some effect , large or small , upon Gentile-Jewish relations .</s>

<s>what shall these effects be ?</s>

<s>I am deliberately raising the policy problems involved in Gentile-Jewish relations .</s>

<s>comprehensive examination of any policy question calls for the performance of the intellectual tasks inseparable from any problem-solving method .</s>

<s>the tasks are briefly indicated by these questions : what are my goals in Gentile-Jewish relations ?</s>

<s>what are the historical trends in this country and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized ?</s>

<s>what factors condition the degree of realization at various times and places ?</s>

<s>what is the probable course of future developments ?</s>

<s>what policies if adopted and applied in various circumstances will increase the likelihood that future events will coincide with desired events and do so at least cost in terms of all human values ?</s>

<s>it is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy questions of such depth and range .</s>

<s>the discussion is therefore limited to a suggested procedure for realizing at least some of the potential importance of this volume for future policy .</s>

<s>as a groundwork for the proposal I give some attention to the first task enumerated above , the clarification of goal .</s>

<s>my reply is that I associate myself with all those who affirm that Gentile-Jewish relations should contribute to the theory and practice of human dignity .</s>

<s>the basic goal finds partial expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , a statement initiated and endorsed by individuals and organizations of many religious and philosophical traditions .</s>

<s>within this frame of reference policies appropriate to claims advanced in the name of the Jews depend upon which Jewish identity is involved , as well as upon the nature of the claim , the characteristics of the claimant , the justifications proposed , and the predispositions of the community decision makers who are called upon to act .</s>

<s>if Jews are identified as a religious body in a controversy that comes before a national or international tribunal , it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity to protect freedom of worship .</s>

<s>when decision makers act within this frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate to religion .</s>

<s>since the recognition of Israel as a nation state , claims are made in many cases which identify the claimant as a member of the new body politic .</s>

<s>community decision makers must make up their minds whether a claim is acceptable to the larger community in terms of prevailing expectations regarding members of nation states .</s>

<s>in free countries many controversies involve self-styled Jews who use the symbol in asserting a vaguely cultural rather than religious or political identity .</s>

<s>the decision maker who acts for the community as a whole must decide whether the objectives pursued and the methods used are appropriate to public policy regarding cultural groups .</s>

<s>we know that much is made of the multiplicity and ambiguity of the identities that cluster around the key symbol of the Jew .</s>

<s>many public and private controversies will undoubtedly continue to reflect these confusions in the mind and usage of Gentile and Jew .</s>

<s>however , in the context of legal and civic policy , these controversies are less than novel .</s>

<s>they involve similar uncertainties regarding the multiple identities of any number of non-Jewish groups .</s>

<s>so far as the existing body of formal principle and procedure is concerned , categorical novelties are not to be anticipated in Jewish-Gentile relationships ;
claims are properly disposed of according to norms common to all parties .</s>

<s>it is not implied that formal principles and procedures are so firmly entrenched within the public order of the world community or even of free commonwealths that they will control in all circumstances involving Jews and Gentiles during coming years .</s>

<s>social process is always anchored in past predisposition ;
but it is perennially restructured in situations where anchors are dragged or lost .</s>

<s>in conformance with the maximization principle we affirm that Gentile-Jewish relations will be harmonious or inharmonious to the degree that one relation or the other is expected by the active participants to yield the greatest net advantage , taking all value outcomes and effects into consideration .</s>

<s>it is not difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative tensions will cumulate ;
for instance , imagine the situation if Israel ever joins an enemy coalition .</s>

<s>the formal position of Americans who identify themselves with one or more of the several identities of the Jewish symbol is already clear ;
the future weight of informal factors cannot be so easily assessed .</s>

<s>when we consider the disorganized state of the world community , and the legacy of predispositions adversely directed against all who are identified as Jews , it is obvious that the struggle for the minds and muscles of men needs to be prosecuted with increasing vigor and skill .</s>

<s>during moments of intense crisis the responsibility of political leaders is overwhelming .</s>

<s>but their freedom of policy is limited by the pattern of predisposition with which they and the people around them enter the crisis .</s>

<s>at such critical moments predispositions favorable to human dignity most obviously pay off .</s>

<s>by the same test predispositions destructive of human personality exercise their most sinister impact , with the result that men of good will are often trapped and nullified .</s>

<s>among measures in anticipation of crisis are plans to inject into the turmoil as assistants of key decision makers qualified persons who are cognizant of the corrosive effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are also able to raise calm and realistic voices when overburdened leaders near the limit of self-control .</s>

<s>we are learning how to do these things in some of the vast organized structures of modern society ;
the process can be accelerated .</s>

<s>a truism is that the time to prepare for the worst is when times are best .</s>

<s>during intercrisis periods the educational facilities of the community have the possibility of remolding the perspectives and altering the behavior of vast numbers of human beings of every age and condition .</s>

<s>as more men and women are made capable of living up to the challenge of decency the chances are improved that the pattern of predisposition prevailing in positions of strength in future crises can be favorably affected .</s>

<s>now an abiding difficulty of paragraphs like the foregoing is that they appear to preach ;
and in contemporary society we often complain of too much reaffirmation of the goodness of the good .</s>

<s>in any case I do not intend to let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the problem of implementing good intentions .</s>

<s>I assume that the number of readers of this anthology who regard themselves as morally perfect is small , and that most readers are willing to consider procedures by which they may gain more insight into themselves and better understanding of others .</s>

<s>properly used , the present book is an excellent instrument of enlightenment .</s>

<s>let us not confuse the issue by labeling the objective or the method psychoanalytic , for this is a well established term of art for the specific ideas and procedures initiated by Sigmund Freud and his followers for the study and treatment of disordered personalities .</s>

<s>the traditional method proceeds by the technique of free association , punctuated by interpretations proposed by the psychoanalytic interviewer .</s>

<s>what we have in mind does have something in common with the goals of psychoanalysis and with the methods by which they are sought .</s>

<s>for what we propose , however , a psychoanalyst is not necessary , aim is to enable the reader to even though one get beneath his own defenses -- his defenses of himself to himself .</s>

<s>for this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is necessary ;
but involvement needs to be accompanied by a special frame of mind .</s>

<s>the relatively long and often colorful selections in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorbed in what is said , whether he responds with anger or applause .</s>

<s>but simple involvement is not enough ;
self-discovery calls for an open , permissive , inquiring posture of self-observation .</s>

<s>the symposium provides an opportunity to confront the self with specific statements which were made at particular times by identifiable communicators who were addressing definite audiences -- and throughout several hundred pages everyone is talking about the same key symbol of identification .</s>

<s>an advantage of being exposed to such specificity about an important and recurring feature of social reality is that it can be taken advantage of by the reader to examine covert as well as overt resonances within himself , resonances triggered by explicit symbols clustering around the central figure of the Jew .</s>

<s>two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time .</s>

<s>one , a reservation on the point I have just made , is the phenomenon of pseudo-thinking , pseudo-feeling , and pseudo-willing , which Fromm discussed in The Escape From Freedom .</s>

<s>in essence this involves grounding one's thought and emotion in the values and experience of others , rather than in one's own values and experience .</s>

<s>there is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself , reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else .</s>

<s>clearly what the person brings to the reading is important .</s>

<s>moreover , if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in a work , he is contributing to this pseudo-thinking ;
if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work , he is helping them to achieve their own identity .</s>

<s>the second timely part of this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products of today .</s>

<s>in the range and variety of characters who , in their literary lives , get along all right with life styles one never imagined possible , there is an implicit lesson in differentiation .</s>

<s>the reader , observing this process , might ask why not be different ?</s>

<s>and find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species .</s>

<s>the observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be , like the models he sees , even more like everybody else .</s>

<s>and this , I think , holds for values as well as life styles .</s>

<s>one would need to test this proposition carefully ;
after all , the large ( and probably unreliable ) Reader's Digest literature on the most unforgettable character I ever met deals with village grocers , country doctors , favorite if illiterate aunts , and so forth .</s>

<s>scientists often turn out to be idiosyncratic , too .</s>

<s>but still , the proposition is worth examination .</s>

<s>it is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience , the morality , the sensitivity to some code of right and wrong .</s>

<s>I do not know that this is true ;
both Flugel and Ranyard West deal with the development and nature of conscience , as do such theologians as Niebuhr and Buber .</s>

<s>it forms the core of many , perhaps most , problems of psychotherapy .</s>

<s>I am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary study in the development of conscience -- most of their attention is to a pre-literate period of life , or , for the theologians of course , to the influence of religion .</s>

<s>still , it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one's ideas of right and wrong ;
certainly the awakened alarm over the comic books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of this influence .</s>

<s>probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available .</s>

<s>this is in large part a code of behavior and a glossary of values : what is it that people do and should do and how one should regard it .</s>

<s>in a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth-century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover , how to behave , how to think about this new experience , how to exercise restraint .</s>

<s>literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose , dedication , mission , significance .</s>

<s>this , no doubt , is part of what Gilbert Seldes implies when he says of the arts , they give form and meaning to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense .</s>

<s>men seem almost universally to want a sense of function , that is , a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone , living or unborn , close and immediate or generalized .</s>

<s>feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation .</s>

<s>a need so deeply planted , asking for direction , so to speak , is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples and heroic proportions of literature .</s>

<s>the terms renewal and refreshed , which often come up in aesthetic discussion , seem partly to derive their import from the renewal of purpose and a refreshed sense of significance a person may receive from poetry , drama , and fiction .</s>

<s>the notion of inspiration is somehow cognate to this feeling .</s>

<s>how literature does this , or for whom , is certainly not clear , but the content , form , and language of the message , as well as the source , would all play differentiated parts in giving and molding a sense of purpose .</s>

<s>one of the most salient features of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization of emotion .</s>

<s>let us differentiate a few of these ideas .</s>

<s>the Aristotelian notion of catharsis , the purging of emotion , is a persistent and viable one .</s>

<s>the idea here is one of discharge but this must stand in opposition to a second view , Plato's notion of the arousal of emotion .</s>

<s>a third idea is that artistic literature serves to reduce emotional conflicts , giving a sense of serenity and calm to individuals .</s>

<s>this is given some expression in Beardsley's notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision .</s>

<s>a fourth view is the transformation of emotion , as in Housman's fine phrase on the arts : they transform and beautify our inner nature .</s>

<s>it is possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion is a fifth idea .</s>

<s>F.S.C.</s>

<s>Northrop , in his discussion of The Functions And Future Of Poetry , suggests this : one of the things which makes our lives drab and empty and which leaves us , at the end of the day , fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing , practical , utilitarian concern of common-sense objects .</s>

<s>if art is to release us from these postulated things ( things we must think symbolically about ) and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy , it must sever its connection with these common sense entities .</s>

<s>I take the central meaning here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality of life without literature and a life enriched by it .</s>

<s>Richards' view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety : for him it constitutes , in part , the organization of impulses .</s>

<s>a sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account of all of these .</s>

<s>but there is one in particular which , it seems to me , deserves special attention .</s>

<s>in the wide range of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effects than the control of love and hate .</s>

<s>the study of literature contributes to this control in a curious way .</s>

<s>William Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks , it seems to me , have a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected : for if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love ( and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of Platonic esteem ) and if it is to talk of anger and murder ( and yet not aim at arousing anger and indignation ) -- then it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification , compounding , or magnification , or any direct assault upon the affections at all .</s>

<s>something indirect , mixed , reconciling , tensional might well be the stratagem , the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like expressions of these emotions , without aiming at their incitement or even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement .</s>

<s>the rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions may be a most valuable human experience .</s>

<s>here I do not mean catharsis , the discharge of emotion .</s>

<s>I mean something more like Freud's concept of the utility of play to a small child : he plays house or doctor or fireman as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences , reliving them imaginatively until they are under control .</s>

<s>there is a second feature of the influences of literature , good literature , on emotional life which may have some special value for our time .</s>

<s>in B. M. Spinley's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of London , a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience .</s>

<s>perhaps it is only an analogy , but one of the most obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation .</s>

<s>anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what I mean .</s>

<s>it is at least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as well as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature .</s>

<s>in any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions , particularly with respect to the sense of harmony , or relief of tension , or sense of a transformed inner nature which may occur , a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required .</s>

<s>in the calm which follows the reading of a poem , for example , is the effect produced by the enforced quiet , by the musical quality of words and rhythm , by the sentiments or sense of the poem , by the associations with earlier readings , if it is familiar , by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate , by the diversion of attention , by the sense of security in a legitimized withdrawal , by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regarded as forbidden , or by half-conscious ideas about the magical power of words ?</s>

<s>these are , if the research is done with subtlety and skill , researchable topics , but the research is missing .</s>

<s>one of the most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility that it is thought to provide .</s>

<s>sensibility is a vague word , covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent , quality , or skill .</s>

<s>among other things it means perception , discrimination , sensitivity to subtle differences .</s>

<s>both the extent to which this is true and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged .</s>

<s>its truth is illustrated by the skill , sensitivity , and general expertise of the English professor with whom one attends the theatre .</s>

<s>the limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment : contrast the perceptual skill of English professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor cars , political candidates , or female beauty .</s>

<s>along these lines , the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than I have seen .</s>

<s>in a symposium and general exploration of the field of Personal Perception and Interpersonal Behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ;
Solomon Asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc. )</s>

<s>dealing with personal qualities of human beings and events .</s>

<s>but to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap .</s>

<s>I would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth .</s>

<s>I use this term to mean three things : a search for the human significance of an event or state of affairs , a tendency to look at wholes rather than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling .</s>

<s>it is the obverse of triviality , shallowness , emotional anaesthesia .</s>

<s>I think these attributes cluster , but I have no evidence .</s>

<s>in fact , I can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure to literary art .</s>

<s>the late R. G. Collingwood , a philosopher whose work has proved helpful to many students of literature , once wrote :
we are all , though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it , in far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with Chaucer and Cimabue , or even Shakespeare and Titian .</s>

<s>by an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien present , and enjoy the carvings of cavemen and Japanese colour-prints ;
but the possibility of this effort is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries , and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken place .</s>

<s>the natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy contemporary art , to despise and dislike the art of the recent past , and wholly to ignore everything else .</s>

<s>one might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general public , of the newspaper critic , and of the creative artist himself .</s>

<s>there results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary .</s>

<s>such study may take many forms .</s>

<s>the study of ideas in literature is one of these .</s>

<s>of course , it goes without saying that no student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene .</s>

<s>he will frequently return to it .</s>

<s>the continuities , contrasts , and similarities discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible and the one is often understood through the other .</s>

<s>when we assert the value of such study , we find ourselves committed to an important assumption .</s>

<s>most students of literature , whether they call themselves scholars or critics , are ready to argue that it is possible to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them .</s>

<s>many will add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding .</s>

<s>this understanding , of course , may in its turn take many forms and some of these -- especially those most interesting to the student of comparative literature -- are essentially historical .</s>

<s>but the historian of literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic questions of form , texture , or technique .</s>

<s>he may also consider ideas .</s>

<s>it is true that this distinction between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight .</s>

<s>but , in general , we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other .</s>

<s>at this point a working definition of idea is in order , although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed .</s>

<s>the term idea refers to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the immediacies of sensuous or emotional experience .</s>

<s>it is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy .</s>

<s>an idea , let us say , may be roughly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may be concerned .</s>

<s>in this essay , we are , along with most historians , interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas , that are so to speak writ large in history of literature where they recur continually .</s>

<s>outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself , including the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries ;
also secondary notions such as the perfectibility of man , the depravity of man , and the dignity of man .</s>

<s>one might , indeed , argue that the history of ideas , in so far as it includes the literatures , must center on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning .</s>

<s>we need not , to be sure , expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature .</s>

<s>an idea , of the sort that we have in mind , although of necessity readily available to imagination , is more general in connotation than most poetic or literary images , especially those appearing in lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience .</s>

<s>thus Burns's My love is like a red , red rose and Hopkins' The thunder-purple sea-beach , plumed purple of Thunder although clearly intelligible in content , hardly present ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned .</s>

<s>on the other hand , Arnold's The unplumbed , salt , estranging sea , taken in its context , certainly does so .</s>

<s>understanding a work of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies .</s>

<s>thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject matter typical or atypical of its period .</s>

<s>again , he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways .</s>

<s>our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries .</s>

<s>very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or belongs to some way of thought labelled as a school or an -ism , i.e.</s>

<s>a complex or syndrome of ideas occurring together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification .</s>

<s>thus ideas like grace , salvation , and providence cluster together in traditional Christianity .</s>

<s>usually the work studied offers us a special or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the ideas in question , so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expressions of an -ism or mode of thought .</s>

<s>accordingly we may speak of the Platonism peculiar to Shelley's poems or the type of Stoicism present in Henley's Invictus , and we may find that describing such Platonism or such Stoicism and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise .</s>

<s>after all , Shelley is no orthodox or Hellenic Platonist , and even his romantic Platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries .</s>

<s>again , Henley's attitude of defiance which colors his ideal of self-mastery is far from characteristic of a Stoic thinker like Marcus Aurelius , whose gentle acquiescence is almost Christian , comparable to the patience expressed in Milton's sonnet on his own blindness .</s>

<s>in recent years , we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature and the arts , although these aspects should be studied in conjunction with the history of philosophy , of religion , and of the sciences .</s>

<s>when these fields are surveyed together , important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence , a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions , primarily literary , religious , and philosophical , but frequently including contact with the fine arts and even , to some extent , with science .</s>

<s>here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the historian's research .</s>

<s>let us quote once more from R. G. Collingwood : history is properly concerned with the actions of human beings regarded from the outside , an action is an event or series of events occurring in the physical world ;
regarded from the inside , it is the carrying into action of a certain thought the historian's business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts which constituted them .</s>

<s>it is a characteristic of thoughts that in re-thinking them we come , ipso facto , to understand why they were thought .</s>

<s>such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , is not a matter of intuition .</s>

<s>history has this in common with every other science : that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge , except where he can justify his claim by exhibiting to himself in the first place , and secondly to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration , the grounds upon which it is based .</s>

<s>this is what was meant , above , by describing history as inferential .</s>

<s>the knowledge in virtue of which a man is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves about certain events .</s>

<s>it is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns , by no means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research .</s>

<s>the student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition , which are at the same time patterns of transformation , whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another .</s>

<s>let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought -- turning our attention from the Reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades .</s>

<s>we may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts .</s>

<s>finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at present widespread .</s>

<s>no one will deny that such broad developments and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them .</s>

<s>still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature .</s>

<s>the actual moments of contact are vitally important .</s>

<s>these moments are historical events in the lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative literature must be frequently concerned .</s>

<s>perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recurring literary influence on the Western world has been that of the Old and New Testament .</s>

<s>certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of Western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the Bible .</s>

<s>this reading and the comments that it evoked constitute the influence .</s>

<s>a contrast of the scripture reading of , let us say , St. Augustine , John Bunyan , and Thomas Jefferson , all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment , can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression .</s>

<s>in much the same way , we recognize the importance of Shakespeare's familarity with Plutarch and Montaigne , of Shelley's study of Plato's dialogues , and of Coleridge's enthusiastic plundering of the writings of many philosophers and theologians from Plato to Schelling and William Godwin , through which so many abstract ideas were brought to the attention of English men of letters .</s>

<s>we may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the scientists .</s>

<s>English philosopher Samuel Alexander's debt to Wordsworth and Meredith is a recent interesting example , as also A. N. Whitehead's understanding of the English romantics , chiefly Shelley and Wordsworth .</s>

<s>Hegel's profound admiration for the insights of the Greek tragedians indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy .</s>

<s>again the student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating , if to our minds grotesque , anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the natural elimination of the unfit in Lucretius , who in turn seems to have borrowed the concept from the philosopher Empedocles .</s>

<s>here an important caveat is in order .</s>

<s>we must avoid the notion , suggested to some people by examples such as those just mentioned , that ideas are units in some way comparable to coins or counters that can be passed intact from one group of people to another or even , for that matter , from one individual to another .</s>

<s>suppose you take Mr. Hearst's morning American at $10,000 a year , Brisbane proposed .</s>

<s>you could come down to the office once a day , look over a few exchanges , dictate an editorial , and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary labors .</s>

<s>if within one year you can make a success out of the American , you can practically name your own salary thereafter .</s>

<s>of course , if you don't make the American a success , Hearst will have no further use for you .</s>

<s>the blue-eyed Watson decided that he would dislike living in New York , and the deal fell through .</s>

<s>Hearst's luck was even poorer when he had a chat with Franklin K. Lane , a prominent California journalist and reform politician , whom he asked for his support .</s>

<s>Lane was still burning because he had narrowly missed election as governor of California in 1902 and laid his defeat to the antagonism of Hearst's San Francisco Examiner .</s>

<s>Hearst disclaimed blame for this , but the conversation , according to Lane , ended on a tart note .</s>

<s>Mr. Lane , Hearst said , if you ever wish anything that I can do , all you will have to do will be to send me a telegram asking , and it will be done .</s>

<s>Mr. Hearst , Lane replied as he left , if you ever get a telegram from me asking you to do anything , you can put the telegram down as a forgery .</s>

<s>Hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to New York to become a father .</s>

<s>on April 10 , 1904 , his first child was born , a son named George after the late Senator .</s>

<s>Hearst saw his wife and child , sent a joyful message to his mother in California , and soon returned to Washington , where on April 22 , for the first time , he opened his mouth in Congress .</s>

<s>this was not before the House but before the Judiciary Committee , where he asked for action on one of his pet bills , that calling for an investigation of the coal-railroad monopoly .</s>

<s>Attorney Shearn had worked on this for two years and had succeeded in getting a report supporting his stand from the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York .</s>

<s>Hearst had spent more than $60,000 of his own money in the probe , but still Attorney General Knox was quiescent .</s>

<s>six of the railroads carrying coal to Tidewater from the Pennsylvania fields , Hearst said , not only had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned outright at least eleven mines .</s>

<s>they had watered their stock at immense profit , then had raised the price of coal fifty cents a ton , netting themselves another $20,000,000 in annual profit .</s>

<s>the Attorney General has been brooding over that evidence like an old hen on a doorknob for eighteen months , Hearst said .</s>

<s>he has not acted in any way , and won't let anyone take it away from him .</s>

<s>what I want is to have this evidence come before Congress and if the Attorney General does not report it , as I am very sure he won't , as he has refused to do anything of the kind , I then wish that a committee of seven Representatives be appointed with power to take the evidence .</s>

<s>the Congressman tried hard , but failed .</s>

<s>this was the very sort of legislation that Roosevelt himself had in mind .</s>

<s>there can be little doubt that there was a conspiracy in Washington , overt or implied , to block anything Hearst wanted , even if it was something good .</s>

<s>hatred tied his hands in Congress .</s>

<s>Roosevelt and others considered him partly responsible for the murder of McKinley .</s>

<s>they were repelled by his noisy newspapers , his personal publicity , his presumptuous campaign for the Presidential nomination , and by the swelling cloud of rumor about his moral lapses .</s>

<s>he might get votes from his constituents , but he would never get a helping hand in Congress .</s>

<s>he was the House pariah .</s>

<s>even the regular Democrats disowned him .</s>

<s>inherently incapable of cooperating with others , he ran his own show regardless of how many party-line Democratic toes he stepped on .</s>

<s>he was a political maverick , a reformer with his own program , determined to bulldoze it through or to blazon the infamy of those who balked him .</s>

<s>he showed little interest in measures put forward by the regular Democrats .</s>

<s>he sought to run Congress as he ran his New York American or Journal , a scheme veteran legislators resisted .</s>

<s>for a freshman Congressman to read political Lessons to graybeard Democrats was poor policy for one who needed to make friends .</s>

<s>he soon quarreled with all the party leaders in the House , and came to be regarded with detestation by regular Democrats as a professional radical leading a small pack of obedient terriers whose constant snapping was demoralizing to party discipline .</s>

<s>to old-line Democrats , the Hearst Presidential boom , now in full cry , was the joke of the new century .</s>

<s>yet no leader had come to the fore who seemed likely to give the puissant T. R. a semblance of a race .</s>

<s>there was talk of dragging old ex-President Cleveland out of retirement for another try .</s>

<s>some preferred Judge Alton B. Parker of New York .</s>

<s>there was a host of dark horses .</s>

<s>the sneers at Hearst changed to concern when it was seen that he had strong support in many parts of the country .</s>

<s>platoons of Hearst agents were traveling from state to state in a surprisingly successful search for delegates at the coming convention , and there were charges that money was doing a large part of the persuading .</s>

<s>just when it was needed for the campaign , Hearst Paper No.</s>

<s>8 , the Boston American , began publication .</s>

<s>a Bay State supporter said , Mr. Hearst's fight has been helped along greatly by the starting of his paper in Boston .</s>

<s>his candidacy affected his journalism somewhat .</s>

<s>he ordered his editors to tone down on sensationalism and to refrain from using such words as seduction , rape , abortion , criminal assault and born out of wedlock .</s>

<s>in a story headed , Hearst Offers Cash
, the Republican New York Tribune spread the money rumor , quoting an unnamed Hearst supporter as saying : the argument that is cutting most ice is that Hearst is the only candidate who is fighting the trusts fearlessly and who would use all the powers of government to disrupt them if he were elected .</s>

<s>the Hearst men say that if Hearst is nominated , he and his immediate friends will contribute to the Democratic National Committee the sum of $1,500,000 .</s>

<s>this , it is urged , would relieve the national committee from the necessity of appealing to the trust magnates .</s>

<s>the alternative to this is that if a conservative candidate is nominated the national committee will have to appeal to the trusts for their campaign funds , and in doing this will incur obligations which would make a Democratic victory absolutely fruitless .</s>

<s>the average Democratic politician , especially in the country districts , is hungry for the spoils of office .</s>

<s>it has been a long time since he has seen any campaign money , and when the proposition is laid down to him as the friends of Mr. Hearst are laying it down these days he is quite likely to get aboard the Hearst bandwagon .</s>

<s>if anything , the conservative Democrats were more opposed to Hearst than the Republicans .</s>

<s>in his own state of New York , the two Democratic bellwethers , State Leader Hill and Tammany Boss Murphy , were saying nothing openly against Hearst but industriously boosting their own favorites , Murphy being for Cleveland and Hill for Parker .</s>

<s>they had lost twice with the radical Bryan , and were having no part of Hearst , whom they considered more radical than Bryan .</s>

<s>but his increasing strength in the West looked menacing .</s>

<s>it caused Henry Watterson to sound a blast in his Louisville Courier-Journal : does any sane Democrat believe that Mr. Hearst , a person unknown even to his constituency and his colleagues , without a word or act in the public life of his country , past or present , that can be shown to be his to commend him , could by any possibility be elected President of the United States ?</s>

<s>but there is a Hearst barrel .</s>

<s>more splenetic was Senator Edward Carmack of Tennessee , a Parker man .</s>

<s>the nomination of Hearst would compass the ruin of the party , Carmack said .</s>

<s>it would be a disgrace , and , as I have already said to the people of Tennessee , if Hearst is nominated , we may as well pen a dispatch , and send it back from the field of battle : all is lost , including our honor .</s>

<s>a lone pro-Hearst voice from New York City was that of William Devery , who had been expelled as a Tammany leader but still claimed strong influence in his own district .</s>

<s>I understand Hearst is a candidate for Presidential honors , Devery said without cracking a smile .</s>

<s>there's nothing like buildin' from the bottom up .</s>

<s>if he's going to the St. Louis convention as a delegate we ought to know it .</s>

<s>he's got a lot of friends , and he ought to come along and let us know if he wants our help .</s>

<s>Hearst won the Iowa state convention , but ran into a bitter battle in Indiana before losing to Parker , drawing an angry statement from Indiana's John W. Kern : we are menaced for the first time in the history of the Republic by the open and unblushing effort of a multi-millionaire to purchase the Presidential nomination .</s>

<s>our state has been overrun with a gang of paid agents and retainers .</s>

<s>as for the paid Hessians from other states , we are here to instruct the Indiana Democracy in their duty , I have nothing but contempt .</s>

<s>the Hearst dollar mark is all over them .</s>

<s>the talk of a Hearst barrel was increasing .</s>

<s>another Indiana observer later commented , perhaps we shall never know how much was spent ( by Hearst ) , but if as much money was expended elsewhere as in Indiana a liberal fortune was squandered .</s>

<s>in his fight for the Illinois and Indiana delegations , Hearst made several trips to Chicago to confer with Andrew Lawrence , the former San Francisco Examiner man who was now his Chicago kingpin , and once to meet with Bryan .</s>

<s>on one visit he stopped at the office of the American , where he was known surreptitiously as the Great White Chief , and for the first time met his managing editor , fat Moses Koenigsberg .</s>

<s>Koenigsberg never did learn what Hearst wanted , for the latter shook hands and moved toward the door .</s>

<s>never mind , thank you , he said .</s>

<s>I must hurry to catch my train .</s>

<s>another editor pointed despairingly at a bundle of letters that had accumulated for him , saying , but Mr. Hearst , what shall I do with this correspondence ?</s>

<s>I'll show you , Hearst replied , grinning .</s>

<s>he took the stack of mail and tossed it into the waste basket .</s>

<s>don't bother .</s>

<s>every letter answers itself in a couple of weeks .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>the Hearst barrel Hearst hopped into a private railroad car with Max Ihmsen and made an arduous personal canvass for delegates in the western and southern states , always wearing a frock coat , listening intently to local politicians , and generally making a good impression .</s>

<s>he laughed at a story that he planned to bolt the party if he was not nominated .</s>

<s>I should , of course , he said , like any other man , be honored and gratified should the Democrats see fit to nominate me .</s>

<s>but I do not have to be bribed by office to be a Democrat .</s>

<s>I have supported the Democratic party in the last five campaigns .</s>

<s>I supported Cleveland three times and Bryan twice .</s>

<s>I intend to support the nominee of the party at St. Louis , whoever he may be .</s>

<s>the Hearst press followed the Chief's progress at the various state conventions with its usual admiring attention , stressing the enthusiasm and loyalty he inspired .</s>

<s>this was historic in its way , for it marked the first time an American Presidential aspirant had advertised his own virtues in his own string of newspapers spanning the land .</s>

<s>yet his editors did not abandon their sense of story value .</s>

<s>when Nan Patterson , a stunning and money-minded chorus girl who had appeared in a Floradora road show , rode down Broadway in a hansom cab with her married lover , Frank Young , she stopped the cab to disclose that Young had been shot dead , tearfully insisting that he had shot himself although experts said he could not have done so .</s>

<s>Trevelyan's Liberalism was above all a liberalism of the spirit , a deep feeling of communion with men fighting for country and for liberty .</s>

<s>his passion and enthusiasm convey the courage and high adventure of Garibaldi's exploits and give the reader a unique sense of participation in the events described .</s>

<s>the three volumes brought to the fore a characteristic of Trevelyan's prose which remained conspicuous through his later works -- a genius for describing military action with clarity and with authority .</s>

<s>the confused rambling of guerrilla warfare , such as most of Garibaldi's campaigns were , was brought to life by Trevelyan's pen in some of the best passages in the books .</s>

<s>his personal familiarity with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed much to the final result , but familiarity alone would not have been enough without other qualities .</s>

<s>military knowledge , love of detail , and a sure feeling for the portrayal of action were the added ingredients .</s>

<s>but the Garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic story .</s>

<s>Trevelyan contributed considerable new knowledge of the issues connected with his subject .</s>

<s>the outstanding example was in Garibaldi And The Thousand , where he made use of unpublished papers of Lord John Russell and English consular materials to reveal the motives which led the British government to permit Garibaldi to cross the Straits of Messina .</s>

<s>in looking back over the volumes , it is possible to find errors of interpretation , some of which were not so evident at the time of writing .</s>

<s>thus Trevelyan repeats the story which pictured Victor Emmanuel as refusing to abandon the famous Statuto at the insistence of General Radetzky .</s>

<s>later research has shown this part of the legend of the Re Galantuomo to be false .</s>

<s>Trevelyan accepts Italian nationalism with little analysis , he is unduly critical of papal and French policy , and he is more than generous in assessing British policy .</s>

<s>but fifty years later the trilogy still maintains a firm place in the list of standard works on the unification of Italy , a position cautiously prophesied by the reviewers at the time of publication .</s>

<s>Trevelyan's Manin And The Venetian Revolution Of 1848 , his last major volume on an Italian theme , was written in a minor key .</s>

<s>published in 1923 , it did not gain the popular acclaim of the Garibaldi volumes , probably because Trevelyan felt less at home with Manin , the bourgeois lawyer , than with Garibaldi , the filibuster .</s>

<s>the complexities of Venetian politics eluded him , but the story of the revolution itself is told in restrained measures , with no superfluous passages and only an occasional overemphasis of the part played by its leading figure .</s>

<s>if it is not one of his best books , it can only be considered unsatisfactory when compared with his own Garibaldi .</s>

<s>already Trevelyan had begun to parallel his nineteenth-century Italian studies with several works on English figures of the same period .</s>

<s>first The Life Of John Bright appeared and seven years later Lord Grey Of The Reform Bill .</s>

<s>of the two , The Life Of Bright is incomparably the better biography .</s>

<s>Trevelyan centers too exclusively on Bright , is insufficiently appreciative of the views of Bright's opponents and critics , and makes light of the genuine difficulties faced by Peel .</s>

<s>yet he is right when he claims in his autobiography that he drew the real features of the man , his tender and selfless motives and his rugged fearless strength .</s>

<s>in the story of Bright and the Corn Law agitation , the Crimean War , the American Civil War , and the franchise struggle Trevelyan reflects something of the moral power which enabled this independent man to exercise so immense an influence over his fellow countrymen for so long .</s>

<s>because Bright's speeches were so much a part of him , there are long and numerous quotations , which , far from making the biography diffuse , help to give us the feel of the man .</s>

<s>associated in a sense with the Manchester School through his mother's family , Trevelyan conveys in this biography something of its moral conviction and drive .</s>

<s>nineteenth-century virtues , however , seem somehow to have gone out of fashion and the Bright book has never been particularly popular .</s>

<s>the biography of Lord Grey is strictly speaking not a biography at all .</s>

<s>it is a Whig history of the Tory reaction which preceded the Reform Bill of 1832 , and it uses the figure of Grey to give some unity to the narrative .</s>

<s>the volume is a piece of passionate special pleading , written with the heat -- and often with the wisdom , it must be said -- of a Liberal damning the shortsightedness of politicians from 1782 to 1832 .</s>

<s>characteristically , Trevelyan enjoyed writing the work .</s>

<s>the theme of glorious summer coming after a long winter of discontent and repression was , he has told us , congenial to his artistic sense .</s>

<s>and Grey's Northumberland background was close to Trevelyan's own .</s>

<s>but his concentration on personalities and his categorical assessment of their actions fail to convey the political complexities of a long generation harassed by world-wide war and confronted with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented industrial and social transformation .</s>

<s>some historians have found his point of view not to their taste , others have complained that he makes the Tory tradition appear contemptible rather than intelligible , while a sympathetic critic has remarked that the intricate interplay of social dynamics and political activity of which , at times , politicians are the ignorant marionettes is not a field for the exercise of his talents .</s>

<s>the Liberal-Radical heritage which informs all of Trevelyan's interpretations of history here seems clearly to have distorted the issues and oversimplified the period .</s>

<s>for once his touch deserted him .</s>

<s>research in the period of Grey and Bright led naturally to a more ambitious work .</s>

<s>Britain in the nineteenth century is a textbook designed to give the sense of continuous growth , to show how economic led to social , and social to political change , how the political events reacted on the economic and social , and how new thoughts and new ideals accompanied or directed the whole complicated process .</s>

<s>the plan is admirably fulfilled for the period up to 1832 .</s>

<s>more temperately than in the study of Grey and despite his Liberal bias , Trevelyan vividly sketches the England of pre-French Revolution days , portrays the stresses and strains of the revolutionary period in rich colors , and brings developments leading to the Reform Bill into sharp and clear focus .</s>

<s>his technique is genuinely masterful .</s>

<s>by what one reader called a series of dissolving views , he merges one period into another and gives a sense of continuous growth .</s>

<s>but after 1832 , the narrative tends to lose its balanced , many-sided quality and to become a medley of topics , often unconnected by any single thread .</s>

<s>economic analysis was never Trevelyan's strong point and the England of the industrial transformation cries out for economic analysis .</s>

<s>yet after 1832 , the interrelations of economic and social and political affairs become blurred and the narrative becomes largely a conventional political account .</s>

<s>finally , the period after 1870 receives little attention and that quite superficial .</s>

<s>yet Britain In The Nineteenth Century became the vade mecum of beginning students of history , went through edition after edition , and continues to be reprinted up to the very present .</s>

<s>its success is a tribute , above all , to Trevelyan's brilliance as a literary stylist .</s>

<s>in 1924 Trevelyan traveled to the United States , where he delivered the Lowell lectures at Harvard University .</s>

<s>these lectures formed the nucleus of a general survey of English development which took form afterward as A History Of England .</s>

<s>in short order , the general history became his most popular work and has remained , aside from his later social history , the work most widely favored by the public .</s>

<s>The History Of England has often been compared with Green's Short History .</s>

<s>like Green , Trevelyan aimed to write a history not of English kings or English conquests , but of the English people .</s>

<s>the result was fortunate .</s>

<s>the History takes too much for granted to serve as a text for other than English schoolboys , and like Britain in the nineteenth century it deteriorates badly as it goes beyond 1870 .</s>

<s>Trevelyan's excursions into contemporary history were rarely happy ones .</s>

<s>but as a stimulating , provocative interpretation of the broad sweep of English development it is incomparable .</s>

<s>living pictures of the early boroughs , country life in Tudor and Stuart times , the impact of the industrial revolution compete with sensitive surveys of language and literature , the common law , parliamentary development .</s>

<s>the strength of the History is also its weakness .</s>

<s>Trevelyan is militantly sure of the superiority of English institutions and character over those of other peoples .</s>

<s>his nationalism was not a new characteristic , but its self-consciousness , even its self-satisfaction , is more obvious in a book that stretches over the long reach of English history .</s>

<s>and yet the elements which capture his liberal and humanistic imagination are those which make the English story worth telling and worth remembering .</s>

<s>tolerance and compromise , social justice and civil liberty , are today too often in short supply for one to be overly critical of Trevelyan's emphasis on their central place in the English tradition .</s>

<s>like most major works of synthesis , The History Of England is informed by the positive views of a first-class mind , and this is surely a major work .</s>

<s>four years after the publication of The History Of England , the first volume of Trevelyan's Queen Anne trilogy appeared .</s>

<s>by now he had become Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge and had been honored by the award of the Order of Merit .</s>

<s>his academic duties had little evident effect on his prolific pen .</s>

<s>Blenheim was followed in rapid succession by Ramillies And The Union With Scotland and by The Peace And The Protestant Succession , the three forming together a detailed picture of England under Queen Anne .</s>

<s>like his volume on Wycliffe , the work was accompanied by the publication of a selected group of documents , in this case illustrative of the history of Queen Anne's reign down to 1707 .</s>

<s>Trevelyan was at least in part attracted to the period by an almost unconscious desire to take up the story where Macaulay's History Of England had broken off .</s>

<s>in addition , he believed in the dramatic unity and separateness of the period from 1702-14 , lying between the Stuart and Hanoverian eras with a special ethos of its own .</s>

<s>he saw the age as one in which Britain settled her free constitution and attained her modern place in the world .</s>

<s>to most observers , there is little doubt that he placed an artificial strait jacket of unity upon the years of Anne's reign which in reality existed only in the pages of his history .</s>

<s>of the three volumes , Blenheim is easily the best .</s>

<s>in four opening chapters reminiscent of Macaulay's famous third chapter , Trevelyan surveys the state of England at the opening of the eighteenth century .</s>

<s>his delightful picture of society and institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period vividly to life .</s>

<s>he tends to underestimate -- or perhaps to view charitably -- the brutality and the violence of the age , so that there is an idyllic quality in these pages which hazes over some of its sharp reality .</s>

<s>yet as an evocation of time past , there are few such successful portraits in English historical literature .</s>

<s>once the scene is set , Trevelyan skilfully builds up the tense story until it reaches its climax in the dramatic victory of Marlborough and Eugene of Savoy at Blenheim .</s>

<s>the account of the battle is , next to his descriptions of Garibaldi's campaigns , Trevelyan's outstanding military narrative .</s>

<s>the scene is etched in sharp detail , the military problems brilliantly explained , and the excitement and importance of the battle made evident .</s>

<s>if only for this modest masterpiece of military history , Blenheim is likely to be read and reread long after newer interpretations have perhaps altered our picture of the Marlborough wars .</s>

<s>Ramillies And The Union With Scotland has fewer high spots than Blenheim and much less of its dramatic unity .</s>

<s>yet in several chapters on Scotland in the eighteenth century , Trevelyan copes persuasively with the tangled confusion of Scottish politics against a vivid background of Scottish religion , customs , and traditions .</s>

<s>I stood on a table , surrounded by hundreds of expectant young faces .</s>

<s>questions came to me from all sides about my world citizenship activities .</s>

<s>after making a short statement about human rights , and the freedom to travel , I told them I would be going to the Kehl bridge the next morning in order to cross the Rhine into Germany .</s>

<s>may we come with you ?</s>

<s>called out a dozen young voices .</s>

<s>well , I might not get that far , I told them , as actually I have no papers to enter Germany and , as a matter of fact , no permit to return to France once I leave .</s>

<s>that was all they needed .</s>

<s>they would champion me .</s>

<s>we would all meet at ten o'clock at the Kehl bridge , five miles from Strasbourg , and march triumphantly across into Germany .</s>

<s>there was only one hitch : the small town of Kehl , on the other side of the Rhine , was still under French jurisdiction .</s>

<s>the real Franco-German frontier was beyond the town's limits .</s>

<s>in fact , all persons were permitted to cross the Rhine into Kehl , there being no sentry posted on the west side of the river .</s>

<s>that evening , as I learned later , the students , enjoying that spontaneous immodesty in action known only to university students , surged out onto the streets of Strasbourg , overturning empty streetcars , marking up store fronts , and shouting imprudently , Garry Davis to power ]
as I got off the trolley at Kehl bridge the next morning , I was met by what looked like 5,000 students , some of whom were carrying sticks apparently for the coming battle with the police .</s>

<s>alarmed by this display of weapons , I looked toward the bridge and there saw , stretched across the near side , a cordon of policemen , their bicycles forming a roadblock before which stood several French officers in uniform and a small waspish man in a brown derby .</s>

<s>listen please , I called to the students in French .</s>

<s>I thank you most heartily for being here .</s>

<s>this is full evidence of your support for my principles .</s>

<s>these principles , however , will not be served by violence in any form .</s>

<s>if they are right , they will prevail of and by themselves .</s>

<s>I ask you all to support me in this .</s>

<s>if one finger is raised against the authorities , all our moral power will vanish .</s>

<s>your self-control in this respect will be the only witness to your understanding of what I am saying .</s>

<s>I have full confidence in you .</s>

<s>now , let's go .</s>

<s>I marched up to the waiting officials , the students massed behind me .</s>

<s>as usual , the press photographers were on hand .</s>

<s>the waspish man stopped me three paces from the bicycle barricade , and asked me in French if I had papers to leave France .</s>

<s>I replied in the affirmative , taking out my recently acquired titre d'identite et de voyage , on which was stamped a permission to leave France .</s>

<s>he examined it carefully , handed it back and said , eh bien , you may leave France .</s>

<s>I took one step eastward .</s>

<s>one of the uniformed officers stepped in my way , demanding to know whether I had permission to enter Germany .</s>

<s>no , I have no permission to enter Germany , I told him .</s>

<s>alors , you may go no farther , he said imperiously .</s>

<s>is this then the frontier ?</s>

<s>I asked him .</s>

<s>yes .</s>

<s>at this , the students let out a yell , knowing full well the actual frontier was beyond the town of Kehl .</s>

<s>but I have no permission to re-enter France , and I have just left , I told him .</s>

<s>I must then be standing on the line between France and Germany .</s>

<s>the waspish man stepped forward .</s>

<s>line ?</s>

<s>line ?</s>

<s>but there is no line between France and Germany , that is , no actual line .</s>

<s>I mean no line ?</s>

<s>I asked .</s>

<s>but if there is no line , how can there be two countries ?</s>

<s>you have just given me permission to leave France , which I did .</s>

<s>I have witnesses .</s>

<s>and as you know , I have no permission to re-enter France once out .</s>

<s>now I learn I cannot enter Germany .</s>

<s>obviously I'm stuck on the line between the two countries .</s>

<s>the students were laughing uproariously at this piece of logic , and even the policemen were trying hard not to smile .</s>

<s>mais non , the Interior Ministry man coaxed , you may come back to Strasbourg , now , if you wish .</s>

<s>oh ?</s>

<s>then will you give me a visa to re-enter France ?</s>

<s>visa ?</s>

<s>but there is no question of a visa .</s>

<s>you are still in France .</s>

<s>ah , then please tell me where the frontier is because this gentleman here -- I indicated the French occupation officer -- informs me that Germany is just on the other side of him .</s>

<s>the Interior man looked uneasily at his French compatriot .</s>

<s>from the crowd were coming cries of he's right ]
there must be a line ]
and bravo , Garry , continue ]
seeing their hesitation , I said , well , until I have permission to enter Germany , or a visa to re-enter France , I shall be obliged to remain here on the line between two countries , whereupon I moved to the side of the road , parked my backpack against the small guardhouse on the sidewalk , sat down , took out my typewriter , and began typing the above conversation .</s>

<s>the reporters were questioning the Interior man and the French officer , both of whom remained noncommittal as to what action , if any , would be taken in my regard .</s>

<s>finally they went off to file their stories , after the photographers had taken pictures of my latest vigil .</s>

<s>the students crowded around asking questions , slapping me on the back , and generally being friendly .</s>

<s>but what will you do this evening , Mr. Davis ?</s>

<s>asked a young mustached Frenchman .</s>

<s>it will be very cold .</s>

<s>I don't know , I told him , except that I will be here .</s>

<s>I shall see about getting you a tent , he said .</s>

<s>I have a small sports shop in Strasbourg .</s>

<s>that would be a great help , I told him , thanking him for his thoughtfulness .</s>

<s>a special guard was posted at my end of the bridge to make sure I didn't cross , the ludicrousness of the situation being revealed fully in that everyone else -- men , women , and children , dogs , cats , horses , cars , trucks , baby carriages -- could cross Kehl bridge into Kehl without surveillance .</s>

<s>the day passed eventfully enough , with a constant stream of visitors , some stopping only to say hello , others getting into serious conversations , such as one Andre Fuchs , a free-lance journalist from Strasbourg who wrote an article for the Nouvelle Alsatian in highly sympathetic terms .</s>

<s>some students from the University returned around six with a large pot containing enough hot soup to last me a week .</s>

<s>a volunteer food brigade had been arranged , they told me , which would supply me with the necessities as long as I remained at the bridge .</s>

<s>a little later , the sports shop man returned with a small pup tent .</s>

<s>one of the girl students , sitting by while I ate the thick soup , asked me if I had a sleeping bag .</s>

<s>when I informed her that I didn't , she said she would borrow her brother's and bring it to me later that evening .</s>

<s>you do not know me , she said in good English , but my mother was your governess in Philadelphia when you were a child .</s>

<s>her name was Esther Peter .</s>

<s>I was delighted to make that personal contact in such trying and unusual circumstances .</s>

<s>the Peter family proved wonderful and helpful friends in the following days , Mrs. Peter , little Esther , and Raoul , who generously lent me his sleeping bag for my Watch on the Rhine .</s>

<s>sighting a line from the bridge to a small field directly to the side , I pitched the tent that evening on the stateless line , digging a small trench around it as best I could with a toy spade donated by a neighborhood child .</s>

<s>the wind from the Rhine was damp and chill , necessitating a fire for warmth .</s>

<s>after scouring around a bit in the open area , I came across what proved to be tar-soaked logs which crackled and burned brightly , giving off vast rolls of smoke into the ashen sky .</s>

<s>each evening the students appeared with the soup kettle and several petits pains , Esther usually being among them .</s>

<s>I had advised friends to write me to No Man's Land , Pont Kehl , Between Strasbourg and Kehl , France-Germany .</s>

<s>sure enough , mail began trickling in , delivered by a talkative , highly amused French postman who informed me there had been quite a debate at the post office as to whether that address would be recognized .</s>

<s>on Christmas Eve , students brought out two small Christmas trees which I placed on either side of the tent .</s>

<s>as the field on which my tent was pitched was a favorite natural playground for the kids of the understandable French as we gathered around the fire in front of the tent .</s>

<s>to my great surprise and delight , when they saw the two trees they went rushing off , returning shortly with decorations from their own trees .</s>

<s>it was a merry if somewhat soggy Christmas for me that year .</s>

<s>in the mail were invitations to speak at the universities of Cologne , Heidelberg , and Baden-Baden .</s>

<s>twenty thousand world citizens at Stuttgart had signed a petition inviting me to visit their town .</s>

<s>when Dr. Adenauer was approached by a world citizen delegation to find out his disposition of my case , he gave them his personal approval of my entry , saying that all men advocating peace should be welcomed into Germany .</s>

<s>the special guard , however , was still posted on Kehl bridge .</s>

<s>as it began raining at around eight o'clock on December 26th , I retired into my tent early , somewhat tired and discouraged , my body reacting sluggishly because of the continued exposure .</s>

<s>no matter how large the fire , I couldn't seem to shake off the chill that day .</s>

<s>oh , Mr. Davis , are you there ?</s>

<s>a voice drifted in to me above the patter of the rain shortly after I had fallen into a fitful sleep .</s>

<s>who is it ?</s>

<s>we're from the Council of Europe , British delegation .</s>

<s>may we have a word with you ?</s>

<s>I'm sorry .</s>

<s>I've had a trying day and I just can't make it out again , I told them .</s>

<s>I heard nothing more .</s>

<s>later I learned that Sir Hugh Dalton had expressed a desire to see me , hence their trip to No Man's Land .</s>

<s>on the evening of December 27th , Esther noticed my pallid look and rasping voice .</s>

<s>she entreated me to see a doctor , and when I refused , brought one out to see me .</s>

<s>he advised immediate hospitalization .</s>

<s>I wouldn't hear of it because it meant giving up the line , though I realized I was in poor shape physically .</s>

<s>Esther , mistaking my hesitation , assured me that the hospital expense would be taken care of by a leading merchant in Strasbourg whom she had already approached .</s>

<s>no , it's not that , I told her .</s>

<s>you see , once I relinquish the position I've already established here , I couldn't regain it without sacrificing the logic of it .</s>

<s>at that moment , up walked a tall young man with glasses who announced himself as a world citizen from Basel , Switzerland .</s>

<s>without preliminaries , Esther asked him , if you are a world citizen , will you take Garry Davis' place in his tent while he goes to the hospital ?</s>

<s>but of course , with pleasure , he replied .</s>

<s>Esther looked at me .</s>

<s>I looked from her to him .</s>

<s>what is your name ?</s>

<s>I asked him .</s>

<s>Jean Babel .</s>

<s>shake , I said .</s>

<s>you have just enlisted for the Rhine Campaign .</s>

<s>Esther jumped up , ran to him and gave him a little hug .</s>

<s>I am so happy .</s>

<s>now come , Garry , we must go quickly .</s>

<s>the Thirty-eighth Regiment of Ohio Volunteers , one of the regiments in Thomas' First Division during Buell's command , suffered its greatest loss of the war in this action .</s>

<s>a popular belief grew up after the war that the only time during the Civil War that Thomas ever put his horse to a gallop was when he went to hurry up Stanley for this assault .</s>

<s>Sherman was responsible for the story when he said in his memoirs that this was the only time he could recall seeing Thomas ride so fast .</s>

<s>while Thomas' injured back led him to restrain his mount from its most violent gait he moved quickly enough when he had to .</s>

<s>it is not in the record , but he must have galloped his horse at Peach Tree Creek when he brought up Ward's guns to save Newton's crumbling line .</s>

<s>while the final combat of the campaign was being worked out at Jonesborough , Thomas , on Sherman's instructions , ordered Slocum , now commanding the Twentieth Corps , to make an effort to occupy Atlanta if he could do so without exposing his bridgehead to a counterattack .</s>

<s>the dispatch must have been sent after sundown on September 1 .</s>

<s>Slocum made his reconnaissanace the next morning , found the town empty , accepted the surrender of the mayor and occupied the city a little before noon .</s>

<s>on the morning of September 2 the Fourth Corps and the Armies of the Tennessee and the Ohio followed the line of Hardee's retreat .</s>

<s>about noon they came up with the enemy two miles from Lovejoy's Station and deployed .</s>

<s>the Fourth Corps assaulted and carried a small portion of the enemy works but could not hold possession of the gain for want of cooperation from the balance of the line .</s>

<s>that night a note written in Slocum's hand and dated from inside the captured city came to Sherman stating that the Twentieth Corps was in possession of Atlanta .</s>

<s>before making the news public Sherman sent an officer with the note to Thomas .</s>

<s>in a short time the officer returned and Thomas followed on his heels .</s>

<s>the cautious Thomas re-examined the note and then , making up his mind that it was genuine , snapped his fingers , whistled and almost danced in his exuberance .</s>

<s>the next day Sherman issued his orders ending the campaign and pulled his armies back to Atlanta .</s>

<s>the measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign is a matter of personal choice .</s>

<s>Sherman laid great store by place captures .</s>

<s>Hood refused to notice anything except captured guns and colors .</s>

<s>by both standards Thomas had the right to be proud .</s>

<s>Thomas thanked his men for their tenacity of purpose , unmurmuring endurance , cheerful obedience , brilliant heroism and high qualities in battle .</s>

<s>Sherman felt that his own part in the campaign was skillful and well executed but that the slowness of a part of his army robbed him of the larger fruits of victory .</s>

<s>he supposed the military world would approve of his accomplishment .</s>

<s>whatever the military world thought , the political world approved it wholeheartedly .</s>

<s>for some time , despondency in some Northern quarters had been displayed in two ways -- an eagerness for peace and a dissatisfaction with Lincoln .</s>

<s>proposals were in the air for a year's armistice .</s>

<s>Lincoln was sure that he would not be re-elected .</s>

<s>in the midst of this gloom , at 10:05 P.M. on September 2 , Slocum's telegram to Stanton , General Sherman has taken Atlanta , shattered the talk of a negotiated peace and boosted Lincoln into the White House .</s>

<s>to the Republicans no victory could have been more complete .</s>

<s>official congratulations showered upon Sherman and his army .</s>

<s>Lincoln mentioned their distinguished ability , courage and perseverance .</s>

<s>he felt that this campaign would be famous in the annals of war .</s>

<s>Grant called it prompt , skillful and brilliant .</s>

<s>Halleck described it as the most brilliant of the war .</s>

<s>actually the Atlanta campaign was a military failure .</s>

<s>next best to destroying an army is to deprive it of its freedom of action .</s>

<s>Sherman had accomplished this much of his job and then inexplicably nullified it by his thirty-mile retreat from Lovejoy's to Atlanta .</s>

<s>but , so far as its territorial objectives were concerned , the campaign was successful .</s>

<s>within the narrow frame of military tactics , too , the experts agree that the campaign was brilliant .</s>

<s>in seventeen weeks the military front was driven southward more than 100 miles .</s>

<s>there was a battle on an average of once every three weeks .</s>

<s>the skirmishing was almost constant .</s>

<s>in the summary of the principal events of the campaign compiled from the official records there are only ten days which show no fighting .</s>

<s>the casualties in the Army of the Cumberland were 22,807 , while for all three armies they were 37,081 .</s>

<s>men were killed in their camps , at their meals and in their sleep .</s>

<s>rifle fire often kept the opposing gunners from manning their pieces .</s>

<s>modern warfare was born in this campaign -- periscopes , camouflage , booby traps , land mines , extended order , trench raids , foxholes , armored cars , night attacks , flares , sharpshooters in trees , interlaced vines and treetops , which were the forerunners of barbed wire , trip wires to thwart a cavalry charge , which presaged the mine trap , and the general use of anesthetics .</s>

<s>the use of map coordinates was begun when the senior officers began to select tactical points by designating a spot as near the letter J in the word mountain .</s>

<s>a few weeks later the maps were being divided into squares and a position was described as being about lots 239 , 247 and 272 with pickets forward as far as 196 .</s>

<s>this system was dependent upon identical maps and Thomas supplied them from a mobile lithograph press .</s>

<s>orders of the day began to specify the standard map for the movement .</s>

<s>Sherman proved that a railway base could be movable and the most brilliant feature of the Atlanta campaign was the rapid repair of the tracks .</s>

<s>to the Rebels it seemed as if Sherman carried tunnels and bridges in his pockets .</s>

<s>the whistle of Sherman's locomotives often drowned out the rattle of the skirmish fire .</s>

<s>as always , the ranks worked out new and better tactics , but there was brilliance in the way the field commands adopted these methods and in the way the army commanders incorporated them into their military thinking .</s>

<s>the fossilized , formalized , precedent-based thinking of the legendary military brain was not evident in Sherman's armies .</s>

<s>Sherman could never be accused of sticking too long with the old .</s>

<s>one of Sherman's most serious shortcomings , however , was his mistrust of his cavalry .</s>

<s>he never saw that it was a complement to his infantry and not a substitute for it .</s>

<s>then , in some way , this lack of faith in the cavalry became mixed up in his mind with the dragging effect of wagon trains and was hardened into a prejudice .</s>

<s>a horse needed twenty pounds of food a day but the infantryman got along with two pounds .</s>

<s>the horseman required eleven times more than the footman .</s>

<s>so Sherman tried a compromise .</s>

<s>he would ship by rail five pounds per day per animal and the other fifteen pounds that were needed could be picked up off the country .</s>

<s>it failed to work .</s>

<s>already debilitated by the Chattanooga starvation , the quality of Sherman's horseflesh ran downhill as the campaign progressed .</s>

<s>every recorded request by Thomas for a delay in a flank movement or an advance was to gain time to take care of his horses .</s>

<s>well led , properly organized cavalry , in its complementary role to infantry , had four functions .</s>

<s>first , it could locate the enemy infantry , learn what they were doing , and hold them until the heavy foot columns could come up and take over .</s>

<s>second , it could screen its own infantry from the sight of the enemy .</s>

<s>third , it could threaten at all times , and destroy when possible , the enemy communications .</s>

<s>it could reach key tactical points faster than infantry and destroy them or hold them as the case might be for the foot soldier .</s>

<s>its climactic role was to pursue and demoralize a defeated enemy but this chance never came in the Atlanta campaign .</s>

<s>Thomas tried hard to have his cavalry ready for the test it was to meet , but his plans were wrecked when it was forced into a campaign without optimum mobility and with its commander stripped from it .</s>

<s>Sherman knew the uses of cavalry as well as Thomas but he imagined a moving base with infantry wings instead of cavalry wings .</s>

<s>his conception proved workable but slower and it enabled his enemy to make clean , deft , well organized retreats with small materiel losses .</s>

<s>Sherman insisted that cavalry could not successfully break up hostile railways , yet Garrard's Covington raid and Rousseau's Opelika raid cut two-thirds of the rail lines he had to break and Sherman lived in mortal fear of what Forrest might do to his communications .</s>

<s>when McPherson pushed blindly through Snake Creek Gap in a potentially decisive movement , the only cavalry in his van was the Ninth Illinois Mounted Infantry , totally inadequate for its role .</s>

<s>it stumbled on infantry where no infantry should have been and McPherson's aggressive impulse faded out , overwhelmed by fears of the unknown .</s>

<s>a proper cavalry command in his front would have developed the fact that he had run into one division of Polk's Army of the Mississippi moving up from the direction of Mobile to join Johnston at Dalton .</s>

<s>from the night of August 30 to the morning of September 2 there was no Union cavalry east of the Macon railway to disclose to Sherman that he was missing the greatest opportunity of his career .</s>

<s>a great part of the time , Thomas' infantry never knew the location of the enemy line .</s>

<s>at such times Thomas wondered when and where a counterattack would strike him .</s>

<s>it was the hard way to fight a war but Thomas did it without making any disastrous mistakes .</s>

<s>heat during the Atlanta campaign , coupled with unsuitable clothing , caused individual irritation that was compounded by a lack of opportunity to bathe and shift into clean clothing .</s>

<s>to relieve the itch and sweat galls , the men got into the water whenever they could and since each sizable stream was generally the dividing line between the armies the pickets declared a private truce while the men went swimming .</s>

<s>Johnston believed that Sherman put his naked engineers into the swimming parties to locate the various fords .</s>

<s>Lieutenant Colonel James P. Brownlow , who commanded the First Brigade of Thomas' First Cavalry Division , was ordered across one of these fords .</s>

<s>the water was deep and Brownlow took his troopers across naked -- except for guns , cartridge boxes and hats .</s>

<s>they kicked their horses through the deep water with their bare heels , drove the Rebels out of their rifle pits and captured four men .</s>

<s>most of the Rebels got away since they could make better time through the stiff brush than their naked pursuers .</s>

<s>rank was becoming an explosive issue in all three of Sherman's armies .</s>

<s>merited recommendations from army commanders were passed over in favor of political appointees from civil life .</s>

<s>in one of the very few letters in which he ever complained of Meynell , Thompson told Patmore of his distress at having had to leave London before this new friendship had developed further : that was a very absurd and annoying situation in which I was placed by W. M.'s curious methods of handling me .</s>

<s>he never let me know that my visit was about to terminate until the actual morning I was to leave for Lymington .</s>

<s>the result was that I found myself in the ridiculous position of having made a formal engagement by letter for the next week , only two days before my departure from London .</s>

<s>luckily both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion it was not I .</s>

<s>it need hardly be remarked that Thompson was not generally known for his scrupulosity about keeping his social engagements , which makes his irritation in this letter all the more significant .</s>

<s>when Thompson and her daughter began a correspondence which included fervent verses from Pantasaph , Mrs. King felt a proper Victorian alarm .</s>

<s>some , she knew , looked upon Thompson almost as a saint , but others read in The Hound Of Heaven what they took to be the confessions of a great sinner , who , like Oscar Wilde , had -- as one pious writer later put it -- thrown himself on the swelling wave of every passion .</s>

<s>consequently , on October 31 , 1896 , Mrs. King wrote to Thompson , quite against her daughter's wishes , asking him not to recommence a correspondence which I believe has been dropped for some weeks .</s>

<s>Katherine was staying at a convent , and her mother felt that , as Thompson himself seems to have suggested , she might eventually stay there .</s>

<s>this prospect did not please Mrs. King any more than did the possibility that her daughter might marry a Bohemian , but she used it to suggest to Thompson that , it is not in her nature to love you .</s>

<s>for his part , Thompson had explained in a previous letter that there would be nothing but an honorable friendship between Katie and himself .</s>

<s>at no time does he seem to have proposed marriage , and Mrs. King was evidently torn between a concern for her daughter's emotions and the desire to believe that the friendship might be continued without harm to her reputation .</s>

<s>in any case , she told Thompson that she saw no reason why he might not see Katie again , now that this frank explanation has been made & no one can misunderstand .</s>

<s>she ended her letter with the assurance that she considered his friendship for her daughter and herself to be an honor , from which she could not part without still more pain .</s>

<s>after Thompson came to London to live , he received a letter from Katie , which was dated February 8 , 1897 .</s>

<s>she regretted what she described as the unwarrantable & unnecessary check to their friendship and said that she felt that they understood one another perfectly .</s>

<s>this letter concluded with an invitation : I am a great deal at the little children's Hospital .</s>

<s>Mr. Meynell knows the way .</s>

<s>I know you are very busy now , you are writing a great deal & your book is coming out , isn't it ?</s>

<s>but if you are able & care to come , you know how glad I shall be .</s>

<s>ever yours sincerely , Katherine Douglas King the invitation was accepted and other letters followed , in which she spoke of her concern for his health and her delight in seeing him so much at home among the crippled children she served .</s>

<s>it is difficult to say what Thompson expected would come of their relationship , which had begun so soon after his emotions had been stirred by Maggie Brien , but when Katie wrote on April 11 , 1900 , to tell him that she was to be married to the Rev.</s>

<s>Godfrey Burr , the vicar of Rushall in Staffordshire , the news evidently helped to deepen his discouragement over the failure of his hopes for a new volume of verse .</s>

<s>in a letter to Meynell , which was written in June , less than a month before Katie's wedding , he was highly melodramatic in his despair and once again announced his intention of returning to the life of the streets : a week in arrears , and without means to pay , I must go , it is the only right thing .</s>

<s>perhaps Mrs. Meynell would do me the undeserved kindness to keep my own copy of the first edition of my first book , with all its mementos of her and the dear ones .</s>

<s>last , not least , there are some poems which K. King sent me ( addressed to herself ) when I was preparing a fresh volume , asking me to include them .</s>

<s>the terrible blow of the New Year put an end to that project .</s>

<s>I wish you would return them to her .</s>

<s>I have not the heart .</s>

<s>I never had the courage to look at them , when my projected volume became hopeless , fearing they were poor , until now when I was obliged to do so .</s>

<s>o my genius , young and ripening , you would swear , -- when I wrote them ;
and now ]
what has it all come to ?</s>

<s>all chance of fulfilling my destiny is over .</s>

<s>I want you to be grandfather to these orphaned poems , dear father-brother , now I am gone ;
and launch them on the world when their time comes .</s>

<s>for them a box will be lodgment enough .</s>

<s>Katie cannot mind your seeing them now ;
since my silence must have ended when I gave the purposed volume to you .</s>

<s>I ask you to do me the last favour of reading them by 8 to-morrow evening , about which time I shall come to say my sad good-bye .</s>

<s>if you don't think much of them , tell me the wholesome truth .</s>

<s>if otherwise , you will give me a pleasure .</s>

<s>o Wilfrid ]
it is strange ;
but this -- yes , terrible step I am about to take is lightened with an inundating joy by the new-found hope that here , in these poems , is treasure -- or at least some measure of beauty , which I did not know of .</s>

<s>Thompson , of course , was persuaded not to take the terrible step ;
Meynell once again paid his debts and it was Katie , rather than Thompson , whose life was soon ended , for she died in childbirth in April , 1901 , in the first year of her marriage .</s>

<s>the orphaned poems mentioned in the letter to Meynell comprised a group of five sonnets , which were published in the 1913 edition of Thompson's works under the heading Ad Amicam , plus certain other completed pieces and rough drafts gathered together in one of the familiar exercise books .</s>

<s>the publication of Father Connolly's The Man Has Wings has made more of the group available in print so that a general picture of what it contained can now be had without difficulty .</s>

<s>some of the poems express a mood of joy in a newly discovered love ;
others suggest its coming loss or describe the poet's feelings when he learns of a final separation .</s>

<s>the somewhat Petrarchan love story which these poems suggest cannot obscure the fact that undoubtedly they have more than a little of autobiographical sincerity .</s>

<s>when they were first written , there was evidently no thought of their being published , and those which refer to the writer's love for Mrs. Meynell particularly have the ring of truth .</s>

<s>in My Song's Young Virgin Date , for example , Thompson wrote : yea , she that had my song's young virgin date not now , alas , that noble singular she , I nobler hold , though marred from her once state , than others in their best integrity .</s>

<s>my own stern hand has rent the ancient bond , and thereof shall the ending not have end : but not for me , that loved her , to be fond lightly to please me with a newer friend then hold it more than bravest-feathered song , that I affirm to thee , with heart of pride , I knew not what did to a friend belong till I stood up , true friend , by thy true side ;
whose absence dearer comfort is , by far , than presences of other women are ]
taking into account Thompson's capacity for self-dramatization and the possibility of a wish to identify his own life with the misfortunes of other poets who had known unhappy loves , there can be no doubt about his genuine emotion for Katie King .</s>

<s>that she was affected by his protestations seems obvious , but since she was evidently a sensible young woman -- as well as an outgoing and sympathetic type -- it would seem that for her the word friendship had a far less intense emotional significance than that which Thompson gave it .</s>

<s>from the outset , she must have realized that marriage with him was out of the question , and although she was displeased by the unwarrantable interference , it seems probable that she did agree with her mother's suggestion that the poet was perhaps a man most fitted to live & die solitary , & in the love only of the Highest Lover .</s>

<s>the poems which were addressed to her , while they are far more restrained than those of Love In Dian's Lap , show no great technical advance over those of the Narrow Vessel group and are , if anything , somewhat more labored .</s>

<s>their interest remains chiefly biographical , for they throw some light on the utter despair which overtook Thompson in the spring and early summer of 1900 .</s>

<s>whether or not Danchin is correct in suggesting that Thompson's resumption of the opium habit also dates from this period is , of course , a matter of conjecture .</s>

<s>Reid simply states , without offering any supporting evidence , that after he returned to London , he resumed his draughts of laudanum , and continued this right up to his death .</s>

<s>there is every reason to recognize that in the very last years of his life , as we shall see , Thompson did take the drug in carefully rationed doses to ease the pains of his illness , but the exact date at which this began has never been determined .</s>

<s>if , as Reid says , nearly all his poetry was produced when he was not taking opium , there may be some reason to doubt that he was under its influence in the period from 1896 to 1900 when he was writing the poems to Katie King and making plans for another book of verse .</s>

<s>in any event , the critical productivity of that time is abundant proof that if he was taking laudanum , it was never in command of him to the extent that it had been during his vagrant years .</s>

<s>Meynell's remedy for Thompson's despondent mood was typically practical .</s>

<s>he simply found more work for him to do , and the articles and reviews continued without an evident break .</s>

<s>3 as a reviewer , Thompson generally displayed a judicious attitude .</s>

<s>that he read some of the books assigned to him with a studied carefulness is evident from his notes , which are often so full that they provide an unquestionable basis for the identification of reviews that were printed without his signature .</s>

<s>on the basis of this careful reading , Thompson frequently gave a clear , complete , and interesting description of a prose work or chose effective quotations to illustrate his discussions of poetry .</s>

<s>he was seldom an unmethodical critic , and his reviews generally followed a systematic pattern : a description of what the work contained , a treatment of the things that had especially interested him in it , and , wherever possible , a balancing of whatever artistic merits and faults he might have found .</s>

<s>it was , of course , in this drawing of the balance sheet of judgment that he most clearly displayed his desire to do full justice to an author .</s>

<s>reviewing Davidson's The Testament Of An Empire Builder , for example , Thompson found that there was too much metrical dialectic .</s>

<s>poetry , he said , must be dogmatic : it must not stoop to argue like a K.C.</s>

<s>in cloth-of-gold .</s>

<s>yet Davidson impressed him as a poet capable of sustained power , passion , or beauty , and he cited specific passages to illustrate not only these qualities but Davidson's command of imagery as well .</s>

<s>similarly , he wrote that Laurence Housman had a too deliberate manner as well as a lack of inevitable felicity in diction .</s>

<s>but he admired Housman's subtle intellectuality and delighted in the inversion by which Divine Love becomes the most fatal allurement in Love The Tempter .</s>

<s>of course , there were books about which nothing good could be said .</s>

<s>understanding , as he did , the difficulty of the art of poetry , and believing that the only technical criticism worth having in poetry is that of poets , he felt obliged to insist upon his duty to be hard to please when it came to the review of a book of verse .</s>

<s>as he had done on his first Imperial sortie a year and a half before , Lewis trekked southeast through Red Russia to Kamieniec .</s>

<s>thence he pushed farther south than he had ever been before into Podolia and Nogay Tartary or the Yedisan .</s>

<s>there , along the east bank of the Southern Bug , opposite the hamlet of Zhitzhakli a few miles north of the Black Sea , he arrived at General Headquarters of the Russian Army .</s>

<s>by June 19 , 1788 , he had presented himself to its Commander in Chief , the Governor of the Southern Provinces , the Director of the War College -- the Prince .</s>

<s>Catherine's first war against the Grand Turk had ended in 1774 with a peace treaty quite favorable to her .</s>

<s>by 1783 her legions had managed to annex the Crimea amid scenes of wanton cruelty and now , in this second combat with the Crescent , were aiming at suzerainty over all of the Black Sea's northern shoreline .</s>

<s>through most of 1787 operations on both sides had been lackadaisical ;
those of 1788 were going to prove decisive , though many of their details are obscure .</s>

<s>to consolidate what her Navy had won , the Czarina was fortunate that , for the first time in Russian history , her land forces enjoyed absolute unity of command under her favorite Giaour .</s>

<s>Potemkin was directing this conflict on three fronts : in the Caucasus ;
along the Danube and among the Carpathians , in alliance with the Emperor Joseph's armies ;
and in the misty marshlands and shallow coastal waters of Nogay Tartary and Taurida , including the Crimean peninsula .</s>

<s>here the war would flame to its focus , and here Lewis Littlepage had come .</s>

<s>Potemkin's Army of Ekaterinoslav , totaling , it was claimed , 40,000 regular troops and 6,000 irregulars of the Cossack Corps , had invested Islam's principal stronghold on the north shore of the Black Sea , the fortress town of Oczakov , and was preparing to test the Turk by land and sea .</s>

<s>during a sojourn of slightly more than three months Chamberlain Littlepage could see action on both elements .</s>

<s>as his second in command The Prince had Marshal Repnin , one-time Ambassador to Poland .</s>

<s>Repnin , who had a rather narrow face , longish nose , high forehead , and arching brows , looked like a quizzical Mephistopheles .</s>

<s>some people thought he lacked both ability and character , but most agreed that he was noble in appearance and , for a Russian , humane .</s>

<s>the Marshal came to know Littlepage quite well .</s>

<s>at General Headquarters the newcomer in turn got to know others .</s>

<s>there was the Neapolitan , Ribas , a capable conniver whose father had been a blacksmith but who had fawned his way up the ladder of Catherine's and Potemkin's favor till he was now a brigadier ( and would one day be the daggerman designated to do in Czar Paul 1 , after traveling all the way to Naples to procure just the right stiletto ) .</s>

<s>then there were the distinguished foreign volunteers .</s>

<s>representing the Emperor were the Prince De Ligne , still as impetuous as a youth of twenty ;
and General the Count Pallavicini , founder of the Austrian branch of that celebrated Italian house , a courtier Littlepage could have met at Madrid in December , 1780 .</s>

<s>from Milan came the young Chevalier De Litta , an officer in the service of Malta .</s>

<s>out of Saxony rode the Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg , one of the Czarina's cousins and a lieutenant general in her armies , a frank , sensitive , popular soldier whose kindnesses Littlepage would always recall with the sincerest gratitude .</s>

<s>though Catherine was vexed at the number of French officers streaming to the Turkish standard , there were several under her own , such as the Prince De Nassau ;
the energetic Parisian , Roger De Damas , three year's Littlepage's junior , to whom Nassau had taken a liking ;
and the artillerist , Colonel Prevost , whom the Count De Segur had persuaded to lend his technical skills to Nassau .</s>

<s>England contributed a young subaltern named Newton and the naval architect Samuel Bentham , brother to the economist , who for his colonel's commission was proving a godsend to the Russian fleet .</s>

<s>from America were the Messrs. Littlepage and Jones .</s>

<s>Lewis had expected to report at once to Jones's and Nassau's naval command post .</s>

<s>on arrival at headquarters he had , however -- in King Stanislas' words to Glayre -- found such favor with J Potemkin that he made him his aide-de-camp and up to now does not want him to go join Paul Jones .</s>

<s>so of course he stayed put .</s>

<s>having done so , he began to experience all the frustrations of others who attempted to get along with Serenissimus and do a job at the same time .</s>

<s>the Prince's perceptions were quick and his energy monstrous , but these qualities were sapped by an Oriental lethargy and a policy of letting nothing interfere with personal passions .</s>

<s>at headquarters -- sufficiently far from the firing line to make you forget occasionally that you were in a war -- Lewis found that the Commander in Chief's only desk was his knees ( and his only comb , his fingers ) .</s>

<s>an entire theater had been set up for his diversion , with a 200-man Italian orchestra under the well-known Sarti .</s>

<s>in the great one's personal quarters , a portable house , almost every evening saw an elegant banquet or reception .</s>

<s>Lewis could let his eye caress The Prince's divan , covered with a rose-pink and silver Turkish cloth , or admire the lovely tapis , interwoven with gold , that spread across the floor .</s>

<s>filigreed perfume boxes exuded the aromas of Araby .</s>

<s>around the billiard tables were always at least a couple of dozen beribboned generals .</s>

<s>at dinner the courses were carried in by tall cuirassiers in red capes and black fur caps topped with tufts of feathers , marching in pairs like guards from a stage tragedy .</s>

<s>among the visitors arriving every now and then there were , of course , women .</s>

<s>for if Serenissimus made the sign of the Cross with his right hand , and meant it , with his left he beckoned lewdly to any lady who happened to catch his eye .</s>

<s>usually Lewis would find at headquarters one or more of The Prince's various nieces .</s>

<s>right now he found Sophie De Witt , that magnificent young matron he had spotted at Kamieniec four years ago .</s>

<s>the Prince took her with him on every tour around the area , and it was rumored he was utilizing her knowledge of Constantinople as part of his espionage network .</s>

<s>one evening he passed around the banquet table a crystal cup full of diamonds , requesting every female guest to select one as a souvenir .</s>

<s>when a lady chanced to soil a pair of evening slippers , Brigadier Bauer was dispatched to Paris for replacements .</s>

<s>but if The Prince fancied women and was fascinated by foreigners , he could be haughtiness personified to his subordinates .</s>

<s>he had collared one of his generals in public .</s>

<s>his coat trimmed in sable , diamond stars of the Orders of Saints Andrew or George agleam , he was often prone to sit sulkily , eye downcast , in a Scheherazade trance .</s>

<s>when this happened , everything stopped .</s>

<s>as Littlepage noted : a complete picture of Prince Potemkin may be had in his 1788 operations .</s>

<s>he stays inactive for half the summer in front of Oczakov , a quite second-rate spot , begins to besiege it formally only during the autumn rains , and finally carries it by assault in the heart of winter .</s>

<s>there's a man who never goes by the ordinary road but still arrives at his goal , who gratuitously gets himself into difficulty in order to get out of it with eclat , in a word a man who creates monsters for himself in order to appear a Hercules in destroying them .</s>

<s>to help him do so the Prince had conferred control of his land forces on a soldier who was different from him in almost every respect save one : both were eccentrics of the purest ray serene .</s>

<s>Alexander Vasilievitch Suvorov , now in his fifty-ninth year ( ten years Potemkin's senior ) , was a thin , worn-faced person of less than medium height who looked like a professor of botany .</s>

<s>he had a small mouth with deep furrows on either side , a large flat nose , and penetrating blue eyes .</s>

<s>his gray hair was thin , his face beginning to attract a swarm of wrinkles .</s>

<s>he was ugly .</s>

<s>but Suvorov's face was also a theater of vivacity , and his tough , stooping little frame was briskness embodied .</s>

<s>like all Russians he was an emotional man , and in him the emotions warred .</s>

<s>kind by nature , he never refused charity to a beggar or help to anyone who asked him for it ( as Lewis would one day discover ) .</s>

<s>but he was perpetually engaged in a battle to command his own temper .</s>

<s>when Littlepage was introduced , if the General behaved as usual , the newcomer faced a staccato salvo of queries : origin ?</s>

<s>age ?</s>

<s>mission ?</s>

<s>current status ?</s>

<s>woe betide the interviewee if he answered vaguely .</s>

<s>Suvorov's contempt for don't-know's was proverbial ;
better to give an asinine answer than none at all .</s>

<s>despising luxuries of any sort for a soldier , he slept on a pile of hay with his cloak as blanket .</s>

<s>he rose at 4:00 A.M. the year round and was apt to stride through camp crowing like a cock to wake his men .</s>

<s>his breakfast was tea ;
his dinner fell anywhere from nine to noon ;
his supper was nothing .</s>

<s>he hadn't worn a watch or carried pocket money for years because he disliked both , but highest among his hates were looking glasses : he had snatched one from an officer's grasp and smashed it to smithereens .</s>

<s>he kept several pet birds and liked cats well enough that if one crept by , he would mew at it in friendly fashion .</s>

<s>passing dogs were greeted with a cordial bark .</s>

<s>yet General Suvorov -- who had never forgotten hearing his adored Czarina declare that all truly great men had oddities -- was mad only north , northwest .</s>

<s>he had come to learn that a reputation for peculiarity allowed mere field officers a certain leeway at Court ;
in camp he knew it won you the affection of your men .</s>

<s>he had accordingly cultivated eccentricity to the point of second nature .</s>

<s>underneath , he remained one of the best-educated Russians of his day .</s>

<s>he dabbled in verse , could get along well among most of the European languages , and was fluent in French and German .</s>

<s>he had also mastered the Cossack tongue .</s>

<s>for those little men with the short whiskers , shaven polls , and top knots Suvorov reserved a special esteem .</s>

<s>Potemkin -- as King Stanislas knew , and presently informed Littlepage -- looked on the Cossacks as geopolitical tools .</s>

<s>to Serenissimus such tribes as the Cossacks of the Don or those ex-bandits the Zaporogian Cossacks ( in whose islands along the lower Dnieper the Polish novelist Sienkiewicz would one day place With Fire And Sword ) were just elements for enforced resettlement in , say , Bessarabia , where , as the faithful of the Black Sea borders , he could use their presence as bargaining points in the Czarina's territorial claims against Turkey .</s>

<s>Suvorov saw in these scimitar-wielding skirmishers not demographic units but military men of a high potential .</s>

<s>he knew how to channel their exuberant disorderliness so as to transform them from mere plunderers into A-1 guerrilla fighters .</s>

<s>he always kept a few on his personal staff .</s>

<s>he often donned their tribal costumes , such as the one featuring a tall , black sheepskin hat from the top of which dangled a little red bag ornamented by a chain of worsted lace and tassels ;
broad red stripes down the trouser leg ;
broader leather belt round the waist , holding cartridges and light sabre .</s>

<s>Suvorov played parent not just to his Cossacks but to all his troops .</s>

<s>it was probably at this period that Littlepage got his first good look at the ordinary Russian soldier .</s>

<s>these illiterate boors conscripted from villages all across the Czarina's empire had , Suvorov may have told Lewis , just two things a commander could count on : physical fitness and personal courage .</s>

<s>when their levies came shambling into camp , they were all elbows , hair , and beard .</s>

<s>they emerged as interchangeable cogs in a faulty but formidable machine : shaved nearly naked , hair queued , greatcoated , jackbooted , and best of all -- in the opinion of the British professional , Major Semple-Lisle -- their minds are not estranged from the paths of obedience by those smatterings of knowledge which only serve to lead to insubordination and mutiny .</s>

<s>Mando , pleading her cause , must have said that Dr. Brown was the most distinguished physician in the United States of America , for our man poured out his symptoms and drew a madly waving line indicating the irregularity of his pulse .</s>

<s>he's got high blood pressure , too , and bum kidneys , the doctor said to me .</s>

<s>transparent look , waxy skin -- could well be uremia .</s>

<s>he looked disapprovingly at an ash tray piled high with cigarette stubs , shook his head , and moved his hand back and forth in a strong negative gesture .</s>

<s>the little official hung his head in shame .</s>

<s>seeing this , his colleague at the next desk gave a short , contemptuous laugh , pushed forward his own ash tray , innocent of a single butt , thumped his chest to show his excellent condition , and looked proud .</s>

<s>the doctor gravely nodded approval .</s>

<s>at this moment Mando came hurrying up to announce that the problem was solved and all Norton had to do was to sign a sheaf of papers .</s>

<s>we went out of the office and down the hall to a window where documents and more officials awaited us , the rest of the office personnel hot upon our heels .</s>

<s>by this time word had got around that an American doctor was on the premises .</s>

<s>one fellow who had liver spots held out his hands to the great healer .</s>

<s>it was funny but it was also touching .</s>

<s>you know , Norton said to me later , I am thinking of setting up the Klinico Brownapopolus .</s>

<s>I might not make any money but I'd sure have patients .</s>

<s>after luncheon we took advantage of the siesta period to try to get in touch with a few people to whom our dear friend Deppy had written .</s>

<s>Deppy is Despina Messinesi , a long-time member of the Vogue staff who , although born in Boston , was born there of Greek parents .</s>

<s>several years of her life have been spent in the homeland , and she had written to friends to alert them of our coming .</s>

<s>all you have to do , Ilka dear , is to phone on your arrival .</s>

<s>they are longing to see you .</s>

<s>the wear and tear of life have taught me that very few friends of mutual friends long to see foreign strangers , but I planned on being the soul of tact , of giving them plenty of outs was there the tiniest implication that their cups were already running over without us .</s>

<s>my diplomacy was needless .</s>

<s>Greek phone service is worse than French , so that it was to be some little time before contact of any sort was established .</s>

<s>in the late afternoon Mando came back to fetch us , and we drove to the Acropolis .</s>

<s>we stopped first at the amphitheater that lies at the foot of the height crowned by the Parthenon .</s>

<s>the curving benches are broken , chipped , tumbled , but still in place , as are the marble chairs , the seats of honor for the legislators .</s>

<s>the carved statues of the frieze against the low wall are for the most part headless , but their exquisitely graceful nude and draped torsos and the kneeling Atlantes are well preserved in their perfect proportion .</s>

<s>having completed our camera work , we started our climb .</s>

<s>I suppose the same emotion holds , if to a lesser degree , with any famous monument .</s>

<s>will it live up to its reputation ?</s>

<s>the weight of fame and history is formidable , and dreary steel engravings in schoolbooks do little to quicken interest and imagination .</s>

<s>uh huh , we think , looking at them , so that's the Parthenon .</s>

<s>and then perhaps one day we get to Athens .</s>

<s>we are here ]
we've come a long way and spent a lot of money .</s>

<s>it had better be good .</s>

<s>don't worry about the Acropolis .</s>

<s>it is awe-inspiring .</s>

<s>probably every visitor has a favorite time for his first sight of it .</s>

<s>we saw it frequently afterward , but our suggestion for the very first encounter is near sunset .</s>

<s>the light at that time is a benediction .</s>

<s>the serene , majestic columns of the Parthenon , tawny in color against the pure deep blue sky , frame incredible vistas .</s>

<s>all we wanted to do was to stand very quietly and look and look and look .</s>

<s>more than twenty-four hundred years old , bruised , battered , worn and partially destroyed , combining to an astounding degree solidity and grace , it still stands , incomparable testimony to man's aspiration .</s>

<s>in 1687 the Turks , who had been in control of the city since the fifteenth century , with a truly shattering lack of prudence used the Parthenon as a powder magazine .</s>

<s>it was hit by a shell fired by the bombarding Venetian army and the great central portion of the temple was blown to smithereens .</s>

<s>nearby is the temple of Athena .</s>

<s>the architectural feature , the caryatides upholding the portico , famous around the world as the Porch of the Maidens , was referred to airily by Mando as the Girls' Place .</s>

<s>another beautiful building is the Propylaea , the entrance gate of the Acropolis .</s>

<s>my other nugget of art and architectural knowledge -- besides remembering that it was Ghiberti who designed the doors of the baptistery in Florence -- is the three styles of Greek columns .</s>

<s>for some happy reason Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian have always stuck in my mind .</s>

<s>furthermore I can identify each design .</s>

<s>it remained , however , for Mando to teach me that Doric symbolized strength , Ionic wisdom , and Corinthian beauty , the three pillars of the ancient world .</s>

<s>the columns of the Parthenon are fluted Doric .</s>

<s>another classic sight that gave us considerable pleasure was the Evzone sentry , in his ballet skirt with great pompons on his shoes , who was patrolling up and down in front of the palace .</s>

<s>gun on shoulder , he would march smartly for a few yards , bring his heels together with a click , make a brisk pirouette , skirts flaring , and march back to his point of departure .</s>

<s>we did not dare speak to so exalted a being , but Norton aimed his camera and shot him , so to speak , on the rise , the split second between the halt and the turn .</s>

<s>the evening of our first day we drove with Christopher and Judy Sakellariadis , who were friends and patients of Norton , to dine at a restaurant on the shores of the Aegean .</s>

<s>on the way out Mr. Sakellariadis detoured up a special hill from which one may obtain a matchless view of the Acropolis lighted by night .</s>

<s>the great spectacle was a source of rancor , and Son et Lumiere , which the French were trying to promote with the Athenians , was the reason .</s>

<s>these performances were being staged at historical monuments throughout Europe .</s>

<s>by a combination of music , lighting effects , and narration , famous events that have transpired in these locations are evoked and re-created for large audiences usually to considerable acclaim .</s>

<s>the Acropolis had been scheduled for the treatment too , but apparently it was to take place at the time of the full moon when the Athenians themselves , out of respect for the natural beauty of the occasion , were wont to forgo their own usual nocturnal illumination .</s>

<s>Athenian society was split into two factions , the Philistines and the Artists .</s>

<s>the Artists contended that the Philistines , gross of soul , were all for having Son et Lumiere , since the French were footing the bill and the attraction , wherever it had been done , had proven popular .</s>

<s>this was the crassest kind of materialism and they , the Artists , would have no truck with it .</s>

<s>the Acropolis was unique in the world and if that imcomparable work flooded by moonlight wasn't enough for both natives and tourists , then they were quite simply barbarians and the hell with them .</s>

<s>it was very stimulating .</s>

<s>the restaurant to which the Sakellariadises took us on this night of controversy was the Asteria , on Asteria beach .</s>

<s>this is a public bathing beach , easily accessible by tramway from the center of Athens .</s>

<s>office workers frequently go out there to lunch and swim during the siesta period , which , during the summer , lasts from two until five in the afternoon , when shops and offices are again open for business .</s>

<s>they close sometime after eight .</s>

<s>nine o'clock is the rush hour , when the busses are jammed , and by nine-thirty the restaurants are beginning to fill .</s>

<s>bedtime is late , for the balmy evenings are delightful and everyone wants to linger under the stars .</s>

<s>the sand is fine and pleasant , the cabanas are clean , and the parasols , green , raspberry , and butter yellow , are very gay .</s>

<s>although open to the general public it is not overcrowded ;
the atmosphere is that of an attractive private beach club at home .</s>

<s>we went there a couple of times to swim and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly .</s>

<s>this agreeable state of affairs is explicable , I think , on two counts .</s>

<s>one is Greece is not yet suffering from overpopulation .</s>

<s>the public may still find pleasure in public places .</s>

<s>the other is that the charge for cabanas and parasols , though modest from an American point of view , still is a little high for many Athenians .</s>

<s>we were struck by the notable absence of banana skins and beer cans , but just so that we wouldn't go overboard on Greek refinement , perfection was side-stepped by a couple of braying portable radios .</s>

<s>Greek boys and girls also go for rock-and-roll , and the stations most tuned to are those carrying United States overseas programs .</s>

<s>a good deal of English was spoken on the beach , most educated Greeks learn it in childhood , and there were also American wives and children of our overseas servicemen .</s>

<s>for a delightful drive out of Athens I should recommend Sounion , at the end of the Attic Peninsula .</s>

<s>the road , a comparatively new one , is very good , winding along inlets , coves , and bays of deep and brilliant blue .</s>

<s>I suppose the day will inevitably come when the area will be encrusted with developments , but at present it is deserted and seductive .</s>

<s>three beneficial hurdles to progress are the lack of water , electricity , and telephones .</s>

<s>at Sounion there is a group of beautiful columns , the ruins of a temple to Poseidon , of particular interest at that time , as active reconstruction was in progress .</s>

<s>gaunt scaffoldings adjoined the ruins , and on the ground segments of columns two and a half to three feet in thickness were being fitted with sections cunningly chiseled to match exactly the fluting and proportion of the original .</s>

<s>later they would be hoisted into place .</s>

<s>there is a mediocre restaurant at Sounion and I fed a thin little Grecian cat and gave it two saucers of water -- there was no milk -- which it lapped up as though it were nectar .</s>

<s>I think its thirst had never been assuaged before .</s>

<s>Norton and I dined one night in a sea-food restaurant in Piraeus right on the water's edge .</s>

<s>to enter it , you go down five or six steps from the road .</s>

<s>across the road is the kitchen , and waiters bearing great trays of dishes dodge traffic as nimbly as their French colleagues at the restaurant in the Place Du Tertre in Paris .</s>

<s>this restaurant , too , had a cat , a dusty , thin little creature .</s>

<s>how can a cat be thin in a fish restaurant ?</s>

<s>but this one was .</s>

<s>when offered a morsel it glanced right and left and winced , obviously frightened and expecting a kick , but too hungry not to snatch the tidbit .</s>

<s>Greece was one of the highlights of our trip , but beginning in Greece and continuing around the world throughout Southeast Asia the treatment of animals was horrifying , ranging from callous indifference to active cruelty .</s>

<s>this of course was not true of the educated and sophisticated people we met , who loved their pets , but kindness is not a basic human instinct .</s>

<s>we met some charming Athenians , and among them our chauffeur Panyotis ranked high .</s>

<s>his English was limited , and the little he knew he found irritating .</s>

<s>a particularly galling phrase was O.K.</s>

<s>, Panyotis , we have time at our disposal .</s>

<s>this he claimed was the favorite refrain of the English .</s>

<s>they would be lolling under a tree sipping Ouzo , relishing the leisurely life , assuring him that the day was yet young .</s>

<s>let him become honest , and they discard him .</s>

<s>-- but let him be ready to invent whatever falsehood -- to assail whatever character -- and to prostitute his paper to whatever ends -- and they hug him to their heart .</s>

<s>in proportion to the degradation of his moral worth , is the increase of his worth to them .</s>

<s>to exonerate the legislature and thereby extricate himself from a sticky situation , Pike took another course and made it appear that the legislature had been bilked .</s>

<s>he claimed in his attacks that Woodruff , with scurrilous underhandedness , had deliberately written an ambiguous bid that had so confused the honest members of the legislature that they had awarded him the contract without knowing what they were doing .</s>

<s>the charge was so farfetched that Woodruff paid little attention to it , and answered Pike in a rather bored way , wearily declaring that a new hand was pumping the bellows of the Crittenden organ , and concluding : in a controversy with an adversary so utterly destitute of moral principles , even a triumph would entitle the victor to no laurels .</s>

<s>the game is not worth the ammunition it would cost .</s>

<s>we therefore leave the writer to the enjoyment of the unenvied reputation which the personal abuse he has heaped on us will entitle him to from the low and vulgar herd to which he belongs .</s>

<s>despite Woodruff's continuing refusal to debate with Pike through the columns of his newspaper , Pike did not let up his attack for a moment .</s>

<s>over the months he became a political gadfly with an incessant barrage of satirical poems ridiculing Woodruff , the Casca letters belittling Woodruff , and long analytical articles vilifying Woodruff .</s>

<s>so persistent were these attacks that in March of the following year , Woodruff was finally moved to action , and Pike was to learn his first lesson in frontier politics , the subtle art of diversion .</s>

<s>to attack Pike directly would gain Woodruff little , for as a penniless newcomer Pike had nothing to lose .</s>

<s>by this time Woodruff had accurately measured Pike as a man of great personal pride , a man who would fly into a towering rage if his integrity were questioned , and who would be anxious to avenge himself .</s>

<s>Pike's honor would now come under attack , but not by Woodruff himself .</s>

<s>the charges would be made in The Gazette by an anonymous correspondent , and Pike would be so busy trying to track down the illusive character assassin that he would forget about harassing Woodruff .</s>

<s>the strategy worked perfectly .</s>

<s>Pike was stunned by the first blast against his character , which was published in the March 4th issue of The Gazette under the name Vale .</s>

<s>the anonymous correspondent did not resort to innuendoes .</s>

<s>he called Pike a thief .</s>

<s>he said Pike had stolen mules from Harris during the Santa Fe expedition ;
he accused Pike of continuing his sticky-fingered career in Arkansas with the theft of some otter skins in Van Buren .</s>

<s>the charges caught Pike off balance , coming as they did from an unexpected quarter .</s>

<s>outraged , he used the Advocate of March 7th for a denial , sending immediately to Santa Fe and Van Buren for documents to vindicate himself , and demanding that Woodruff reveal the name of this perfidious slanderer who disguised himself under a pastoral pseudonym .</s>

<s>Woodruff said nothing , and Pike , frustrated , stormed throughout Little Rock in an unsuccessful search for Vale , asking his friends to keep their ears open .</s>

<s>finally he learned through the grapevine that the culprit might be one James W. Robinson in Pope County .</s>

<s>without further inquiry , Pike jumped to the conclusion that Robinson was guilty , and , following the honorable route that would eventually lead to the dueling ground , sent a message to Robinson through his friends , demanding that he either confirm or deny his complicity .</s>

<s>Robinson did neither .</s>

<s>to Pike , silence was tantamount to an admission of guilt , and he determined to get Robinson onto the dueling ground at all costs .</s>

<s>on April 11th he wrote an open letter in The Advocate , making it known to the world that Jas.</s>

<s>W. Robinson is by his own admission a base liar and a slanderer .</s>

<s>if Robinson was a liar and a slanderer , he was also a very canny gentleman , for nothing that Pike could do would pry so much as a single word out of him .</s>

<s>preoccupied with his own defense and his attempts to get Robinson to fight , Pike lessened his attacks on Woodruff , and finally stopped them altogether .</s>

<s>and Pike never did find out if Robinson was really responsible for the Vale letter .</s>

<s>Woodruff's strategy had been immensely successful .</s>

<s>it took Pike a long time to realize what Woodruff had done , and it had a profound effect on him .</s>

<s>once he learned a lesson , he never forgot it .</s>

<s>in the next few months of comparative silence , Pike waited patiently until conditions were perfect for a new attack , and then , displaying a remarkable grasp of the subtleties of political infighting , gained from his first bout with Woodruff , he used these changed conditions to excellent advantage .</s>

<s>shortly after the Vale incident , a rift began to develop between William Woodruff and Governor Pope .</s>

<s>one-armed , gruff , frugally honest , Governor Pope had been the ideal man to assume office in Arkansas after the disgraceful antics of political bosses like Crittenden , and he ruled the state with an iron fist , tolerating no nonsense .</s>

<s>Woodruff had supported him all the way , both as a chief executive and as a man .</s>

<s>besides being political allies , they were also friends .</s>

<s>this warm relationship came to an abrupt end in June of 1834 when the National Congress appropriated $3,000 for compiling and printing the laws of Arkansas Territory , and , taking note of the recent wave of corruption in the legislature , left it to the governor to award the contract .</s>

<s>Woodruff wanted this political windfall very badly , and everyone assumed that he would get it because he was a close friend of the governor and his stanchest supporter .</s>

<s>after all , Woodruff owned a competent printing plant and was the logical man for the job .</s>

<s>but because the governor was determined that friendship should not influence him one way or the other , he looked for a printer with a knowledge of the law ( which Woodruff did not have ) , and awarded the contract to a lawyer named John Steele who had started a newspaper in Helena the year before .</s>

<s>Woodruff was furious .</s>

<s>considering the governor's act a personal rebuff , he aired his feelings in The Gazette on August 26 , 1834 :
we think the governor treated us rather shabbily , to say the least of it .</s>

<s>it is but justice to Mr. Steele for us to add that , in the above remarks , nothing is intended to his disparagement , either as a lawyer or as a printer .</s>

<s>he got a good fat job and we congratulate him on his good luck .</s>

<s>we hope that he will execute it in a manner that will entitle him to credit .</s>

<s>as summer cooled into fall and winter , even so the relationship between the two men continued to grow colder by the day , and by December of 1834 it was icy .</s>

<s>it was at this point that Pike decided to capitalize on the bad feelings between the two men .</s>

<s>the eventual prize in this new battle was the public printing contract that Woodruff still held .</s>

<s>from his first bout with the canny Woodruff , Pike had learned that it was better not to attack him directly , so , harping on the theme that the cost of printing was too high , he condemned the governor for permitting such a state of affairs to exist .</s>

<s>to document his charge , Pike set up two parallel columns in The Advocate showing the price charged by The Gazette and the considerably lower price for which the work could be done elsewhere .</s>

<s>then he called on the governor to explain why .</s>

<s>the governor was not used to having his integrity questioned , and he promptly passed the charges on to Woodruff , demanding that Woodruff answer them .</s>

<s>if Woodruff could not furnish a strong explanation , the governor insisted that he lower his prices in accord with the scale printed in The Advocate .</s>

<s>Woodruff was now impaled on the horns of a dilemma .</s>

<s>as a proud man , his prestige would suffer if he let Pike dictate to him through the governor's office , but to lower his prices would be tantamount to an admission that they had been too high in the first place .</s>

<s>as a consequence , he did neither .</s>

<s>very angry at Woodruff , the governor used his personal influence to have the printing contract withdrawn from The Gazette and awarded to the lowest bidder , which , by a strange coincidence , happened to be Pike's Advocate .</s>

<s>and , for the moment at least , the governor now found himself allied with the head of the Crittenden faction he had formerly opposed , and Pike was credited with a clear triumph over Woodruff .</s>

<s>but in the confused atmosphere of frontier politics , alliances were as quickly broken as they were formed , and as Pike came to favor with the governor of the Territory , the governor fell out of favor with the President of the United States .</s>

<s>on January 28 , 1835 , Andrew Jackson removed Pope from office and elevated Territorial Secretary William S. Fulton to the position .</s>

<s>Fulton was a very close friend of Jackson , and had been his private secretary for a number of years in the old days .</s>

<s>as a stanch party man and a rabid Democrat , he had little tolerance for Whigs like Pike , and Pike lost any immediate personal advantage his victory over Woodruff might have gained him .</s>

<s>2 ;
as Pike proved himself adept in the political arena , he also became a social lion in the village of Little Rock , where he served as a symbol of the culture that the ladies of the town were striving so eagerly to cultivate .</s>

<s>after all , Pike was an established poet and his work had been published in the respectable periodicals of that center of American culture , Boston .</s>

<s>his accomplishments , and the fact that he was resident , did much to offset the unkind words travelers used to describe Little Rock after a visit there .</s>

<s>for some reason , none of them were impressed with the territorial capital .</s>

<s>the internationally known sportsman and traveler Friedrich Gerstacker was typical of its detractors in the mid-thirties .</s>

<s>Little Rock is a vile , detestable place .</s>

<s>he wrote .</s>

<s>Little Rock is , without any flattery , one of the dullest towns in the United States and I would not have remained two hours in the place , if I had not met with some good friends who made me forget its dreariness .</s>

<s>Pike enjoyed his new social position tremendously , and cultivated in himself those traits necessary to its preservation .</s>

<s>he was especially popular with women , for , like the romantic poetry he wrote , he was personally gracious , gallant , and chivalrous .</s>

<s>he again began to play the violin , and tucking the instrument beneath his chin , performed soulful and romantic airs to match the expressions on the faces of the lovely women who gathered to hear him .</s>

<s>his artistic accomplishments guaranteed him entry into any social gathering .</s>

<s>he composed songs and set them to music and sang them in a soft , melodious voice , and when his audience had had enough of music he would discourse on politics or tell stories of his western adventures guaranteed to excite the emotions of men and women alike .</s>

<s>the bulk of his early reputation , however , came not from his poetry or his music , but from his excellence as an orator .</s>

<s>by 1834 the art of oratory had reached a very high level in the United States as a literary form .</s>

<s>the orator of this period , in order to earn a reputation , had to pay close attention to the formal composition of his speech , judging how it would appear in print as well as the effect it would have on the audience that heard it .</s>

<s>very soon after his arrival in Little Rock , Pike had joined one of the most influential organizations in town , the Little Rock Debating Society , and it was with this group that he made his debut as an orator , being invited to deliver the annual Fourth of July address the club sponsored every year .</s>

<s>Samuel Gorton , founder of Warwick , was styled by the historian Samuel Greene Arnold one of the most remarkable men who ever lived .</s>

<s>a biographer called him the premature John the Baptist of New England Transcendentalism .</s>

<s>the historian Charles Francis Adams called him a crude and half-crazy thinker .</s>

<s>his contemporaries in Massachusetts called him an arch-heretic , a beast , a miscreant , a proud and pestilent seducer , a prodigious minter of exorbitant novelties .</s>

<s>Edward Rawson , secretary of the colony of Massachusetts Bay , described him as a man whose spirit was stark drunk with blasphemies and insolence , a corrupter of the truth , a disturber of the peace wherever he comes .</s>

<s>Nathaniel Morton stated he was deeply leavened with blasphemous and familistical opinions .</s>

<s>he was thrown out , more or less , from Boston , Plymouth , Pocasset , Newport , and Providence .</s>

<s>on the other hand , Dr. Ezra Styles recorded the following testimony of John Angell , the last disciple of Gorton : he said Gorton was a holy man ;
wept day and night for the sins and blindness of the world had a long walk through the trees and woods by his house , where he constantly walked morning and evening , and even in the depths of the night , alone by himself , for contemplation and the enjoyment of the dispensation of light .</s>

<s>he was universally beloved by his neighbours , and the Indians , who esteemed him , not only as a friend , but one high in communion with God in Heaven .</s>

<s>Gorton sometimes signed himself a professor of the mysteries of Christ .</s>

<s>there is plenty more to recommend Gorton , the facts of whose life are given in The Life And Times Of Samuel Gorton , by Adelos Gorton .</s>

<s>he fought like a fiend for the helpless and oppressed , worked for the abolition of slavery , helped the Quakers and Indians , and worked against the prosecution of witches .</s>

<s>he defied the Boston hierarchy , and after they sent a small army to get him he befuddled the court , including John Cotton , with one of the most complicated religious discourses ever heard .</s>

<s>Samuel Gorton was born at Gorton , England , near the present city of Manchester , about 1592 .</s>

<s>although he did not attend any celebrated schools or universities , he was a master of Greek and Hebrew and could read the Bible in the original .</s>

<s>he worked as a clothier in London , but was greatly concerned with religion .</s>

<s>Gorton left England , he said , to enjoy libertie of conscience in respect to faith towards God , and for no other end .</s>

<s>with his wife and three or more children he arrived in Boston in March , 1637 , and soon found it was no place for anyone looking for liberty of conscience .</s>

<s>Roger Williams had recently been thrown out , and Anne Hutchinson and her Antinomians were slugging it out with the powers-that-be .</s>

<s>Gorton and his family moved to Plymouth .</s>

<s>soon he was in trouble there , for defending a woman who was accused of smiling in church .</s>

<s>she was Ellen Aldridge , a widow of good repute who was employed by Gorton's wife and lived with the family .</s>

<s>the report was : it had been whispered privately that she had smiled in the congregation , and the Governor Prence sent to knoe her business , and command , after punishment as the bench see fit , her departure and also anyone who brought her to the place from which she came .</s>

<s>Gorton said they were preparing to deport her as a vagabond , and to escape the shame she fled to the woods for several days , returning at night .</s>

<s>he advised the poor woman not to appear in court as what she was charged with was not in violation of law .</s>

<s>Gorton appeared for her , however , and what he told the magistrates must have been plenty , for he was charged with deluding the court , fined , and told to leave the colony within fourteen days .</s>

<s>he left in a storm for Pocasset , December 4 , 1638 .</s>

<s>his wife was in delicate health and nursing an infant with measles .</s>

<s>the unconquerable Mrs. Hutchinson was residing at Pocasset , after having been excommunicated by the Boston church and thrown out of the colony .</s>

<s>one can imagine that with her and Gorton there it was no place for anyone with weak nerves .</s>

<s>William Coddington , who was running the colony , felt constrained to move seven miles south where , with others -- as mentioned above -- he founded Newport .</s>

<s>when , in March , 1640 , the two towns were united under Coddington , Gorton claimed the union was irregular and illegally constituted and that it had never been sanctioned by the majority of freeholders .</s>

<s>then he became involved in a ruckus remarkably similar to the one in Plymouth .</s>

<s>a cow owned by an old woman trespassed on Gorton's land .</s>

<s>while driving the cow back home the woman was assaulted by a servant maid of Gorton .</s>

<s>the old woman complained to the deputy governor , who ordered the servant brought before the court .</s>

<s>Gorton reverted to his Plymouth tactics , refused to let her go , and appeared himself before the Portsmouth grand jury .</s>

<s>during the trial he told off the jury , called them just Asses and called a freeman a saucy boy and Jack-an-Apes .</s>

<s>he was jailed and banished .</s>

<s>Gorton then moved to Providence and soon put the town in a turmoil .</s>

<s>he held that no group of colonists could set up or maintain a government without royal sanction .</s>

<s>since Rhode Island at that time did not have such sanction , his opinion was not popular .</s>

<s>Roger Williams wrote his friend Winthrop as follows : Master Gorton , having foully abused high and low at Aquidneck is now bewitching and bemaddening poor Providence , both with his unclean and foul censures of all the ministers of this country ( for which myself have in Christ's name withstood him ) , and also denying all visible and external ordinances in depth of Familism : almost all suck in his poison , as at first they did at Aquidneck .</s>

<s>some few and myself withstand his inhabitation and town privileges , without confession and reformation of his uncivil and inhuman practices at Portsmouth ;
yet the tide is too strong against us , and I fear ( if the framer of hearts help not ) it will force me to little Patience , a little isle next to your Prudence .</s>

<s>Williams also stated : our peace was like the peace of a man who hath the tertian ague .</s>

<s>Providence finally managed to get Gorton out of the town , and he and some friends bought land at Pawtuxet on the west side of Narragansett Bay , five miles south but still within the jurisdiction of the Providence colony .</s>

<s>this town should not be confused with Pawtucket , just north of Providence , or Pawcatuck , Connecticut , on the Pawcatuck River , opposite Westerly , Rhode Island .</s>

<s>up to now , Gorton had been looking for trouble , and now that he was trying to get away from it , trouble started looking for him .</s>

<s>upon intelligence that the formidable agitator was to favor them with his presence , the benighted inhabitants of Pawtuxet , alas , gave their allegiance to Massachusetts and asked that colony to expel the newcomers .</s>

<s>as it was the custom of that alert colony to take over the property of persons asking for protection , this was an act roughly equivalent to throwing open the door to a pack of wolves and saying come and get it .</s>

<s>Gorton and company , however , promptly bought land from Miantonomi a few miles south of Pawtuxet , extending from the present Gaspee Point south to Warwick Neck and twenty miles inland .</s>

<s>the settlement was called Shawomet .</s>

<s>it was not within the jurisdiction of anybody or anything , including Providence and Massachusetts .</s>

<s>if Gorton wanted peace and quiet for his complicated meditations this is where he should have had it .</s>

<s>instead of that he was engulfed by bedlam .</s>

<s>Pomham and Soconoco , a couple of minor sachems ( of something less than exalted character ) under Miantonomi , declared that they had never assented to the sale of land to Gorton and had never received anything for it .</s>

<s>following the glorious lead of the heroes of Pawtuxet , they also submitted themselves to the protection of Massachusetts .</s>

<s>one historical authority presents laborious and circuitous testimony tending to arouse suspicion that Massachusetts was behind the clouds settling down on the embattled Gorton .</s>

<s>however , the General Court at Boston ordered the purchasers of Shawomet to appear before them to answer the sachems' claim .</s>

<s>the purchasers rejected the order in two letters written in vigorous terms .</s>

<s>then Massachusetts switched to its standard tactics .</s>

<s>the attack started on October 2 , 1643 , and the Gortonists held out for a day and a night .</s>

<s>Gorton and ten of his friends were thrown in jail .</s>

<s>on Sunday they refused to attend church .</s>

<s>Gorton replied with blasts that scandalized the congregation .</s>

<s>the Gortonists were charged with blasphemy and tried for their lives .</s>

<s>four ecclesiastical questions were presented by the General Court to Gorton : 1 .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>whether the only price of our redemption were not the death of Christ on the cross , with the rest of his sufferings and obediences , in the time of his life here , after he was born of the Virgin Mary ?</s>

<s>4 .</s>

<s>Gorton answered in writing .</s>

<s>all of the elders except three voted for death , but a majority of the deputies refused to sanction the sentence .</s>

<s>seven of the prisoners were sentenced to be confined in irons for as long as it pleased the court , set to work and , if they broke jail or proclaimed heresy , to be executed if convicted .</s>

<s>when Fred wheeled him back into his room , the big one looking out on the back porch , and put him to bed , Papa told him he was very tired but that he had enjoyed greatly the trip downtown .</s>

<s>I've been cooped up so long , he added .</s>

<s>getting out again , seeing old friends , had given his spirits a lift .</s>

<s>that night after supper I went back over to 48 Spruce Street -- Ralph and I at that time were living at 168 Chestnut -- and Ralph went with me .</s>

<s>Papa was still elated over his afternoon visit downtown .</s>

<s>Baby , I saw a lot of old friends I hadn't seen in a long time , he told me , his eyes bright .</s>

<s>it was mighty good for the old man to get out again .</s>

<s>the next day he seemed to be in fairly good shape and still in excellent spirits .</s>

<s>but a few days after Fred's return he began hemorrhaging and that was the beginning of early and complete disintegration .</s>

<s>it began in the morning , and very quickly the hemorrhage was a massive one .</s>

<s>we got Dr. Glenn to him as quickly as we could , and we wired Tom of Papa's desperate condition .</s>

<s>the hemorrhage was in the prostate region ;
Dr. Glenn saw at once what had happened .</s>

<s>he has lost much blood , he said .</s>

<s>it'll take a lot to replace it .</s>

<s>Dr. Glenn , I've got a lot of blood , Fred spoke up , plenty of it .</s>

<s>let me give Papa blood .</s>

<s>the doctor agreed , but explained that it would be necessary first to check Fred's blood to ascertain whether or not it was of the same type as Papa's .</s>

<s>to give a patient the wrong type of blood , said the doctor , would likely kill him .</s>

<s>that was in the days before blood banks , of course , and transfusions had to be given directly from donor to patient .</s>

<s>one had to find a donor , and usually very quickly , whose blood corresponded with the patient's .</s>

<s>and then it took considerably longer to make preparations for giving transfusions .</s>

<s>they had to take blood samples to the laboratory to test them , for one thing , and there was much required preliminary procedure .</s>

<s>they made the tests and came to Fred ;
by now it was perhaps two days or longer after Papa had begun hemorrhaging .</s>

<s>Fred , your blood matches your father's , all right , Dr. Glenn said .</s>

<s>but we aren't going to let you give him any .</s>

<s>but why in the name of God can't I give my father blood ?</s>

<s>Fred demanded .</s>

<s>why can't I , Doctor ?</s>

<s>because , Fred , it could do him no good .</s>

<s>it's too late now .</s>

<s>he's past helping .</s>

<s>he's as good as gone .</s>

<s>and in a few minutes Papa was dead .</s>

<s>it was well past midnight .</s>

<s>Papa had left us about the same hour of the night that Ben had passed on .</s>

<s>the date was June 20 , 1922 .</s>

<s>W. O. Wolfe , prominent business man and pioneer resident of this section , died shortly after midnight Tuesday at his home 48 Spruce Street , the Asheville Times of Wednesday , June 21 , announced .</s>

<s>Mr. Wolfe had been in declining health for many years and death was not unexpected .</s>

<s>a biographical sketch followed .</s>

<s>funeral services were held Thursday afternoon at four o'clock at the home .</s>

<s>beloved Dr. R. F. Campbell , our First Presbyterian Church pastor , was in charge .</s>

<s>the burial was out in Riverside Cemetery .</s>

<s>all about him stood tombstones his own sensitive great hands had fashioned .</s>

<s>a few years before his death Papa had agreed with Mama to make a joint will with her in which it would be provided that in the event of the death of either of them an accounting would be made to their children whereby each child would receive a bequest of $5000 cash .</s>

<s>at his death Fred and Ralph , my husband , were named executors of the estate under the terms of the will .</s>

<s>Fred and Ralph qualified as executors and paid off what debts were currently due , and they were all current , since Papa was never one to allow bills to go unpaid .</s>

<s>the bills were principally for hospitalization and doctors' fees during the last years of his life , and when he died he owed in the main only current doctor's bills .</s>

<s>after they had paid all his debts and the funeral costs , Ralph and Fred had some fourteen thousand dollars , as I remember , with which to pay the bequests .</s>

<s>this , manifestly , would not provide $5000 to each of the surviving five children .</s>

<s>so what Fred and Ralph did was to attempt to prorate the money fairly by taking into account what each of the five had received , if anything , from the estate before Papa's death .</s>

<s>consequently , Fred and Tom , the two who had been provided college educations , signed statements to the effect that each had received his bequest in full , and Effie and I were each allotted $5000 .</s>

<s>Frank had been given about half his legacy to use in a business venture before Papa's death ;
he was given the difference between that amount and $5000 .</s>

<s>Tom had received four years of education at the University of North Carolina and two at Harvard , and Fred had been in and out of Georgia Tech and Carneigie Tech and part of the time had been a self-help student .</s>

<s>so , because he had received less than Tom , it was felt proper that Fred should receive the few hundred dollars that remained .</s>

<s>and that's how Papa's estate was divided .</s>

<s>Papa , I should emphasize , had been an invalid the last several years of his life ;
his hospital and doctor bills had been large and his income had been cut until he was receiving little except small rentals on some properties he still owned .</s>

<s>had he been able to escape this long siege of invalidism , I'm convinced , Papa would have left a sizable estate .</s>

<s>but he had succeeded well , we agreed .</s>

<s>he had left us a legacy far more valuable than houses and lands and stocks and bonds .</s>

<s>for years Papa and Mama had been large taxpayers .</s>

<s>I recall that several years their taxes exceeded $800 .</s>

<s>in those years of lower property valuations and lower tax rates , that payment represented ownership of much property .</s>

<s>merciful God , Julia ]
I have known Papa to exclaim on getting his tax bill , we're going to the dogs ]
but he never expected to do that .</s>

<s>and he didn't , by a long shot ]
35 .</s>

<s>in the spring of his second year at Harvard , Tom had been offered a job at Northwestern University as an instructor in the English Department .</s>

<s>but he had delayed accepting this job , and as he was leaving to come home to Papa in response to our telegram , he dropped a postcard to Miss McCrady , head of the Harvard Appointment Office , asking her please to write Northwestern authorities and explain the circumstances .</s>

<s>actually Tom had been postponing giving them an answer , I'm confident , because he did not want to go out there to teach .</s>

<s>in fact , he didn't want to teach anywhere .</s>

<s>he wanted to go back to Harvard for another year of playwriting .</s>

<s>but Papa's death had further complicated the financing of Tom's hoped-for third year , and for the weeks following it Tom did not know whether his return to Harvard could be arranged .</s>

<s>but things were worked out in the family and late in August he wrote Miss McCrady an explanatory letter in which he told her that matters at home had been in an unsettled condition after Papa's death and he had not known whether he would stay at home with Mama , accept the Northwestern job , or return to Harvard .</s>

<s>but he was happy to tell her that his finances were now in such condition that he could go back to Harvard for a third year with Professor Baker .</s>

<s>and that's what he did .</s>

<s>that third year he wrote plays with a fury .</s>

<s>I believe there are seventeen short plays by Tom now housed in the Houghton Library at Harvard ;
I think I'm right in that figure .</s>

<s>that fall he submitted to Professor Baker the first acts and outlines of the following acts of several plays , six of them , according to some of his associates , and he also worked on a play that he first called Niggertown , the material for which he had collected during the summer at home .</s>

<s>later this play would be called Welcome To Our City .</s>

<s>in the spring , it must have been , he began working on the play that he called The House , which later would be Mannerhouse .</s>

<s>that spring Welcome To Our City was selected for production by the 47 Workshop and it was staged in the middle of May .</s>

<s>it ran two nights , and though it was generally praised , there was considerable criticism of its length .</s>

<s>it ran until past one o'clock .</s>

<s>that was Tom's weakness ;
it was demonstrated , many critics would later point out , in the length of his novels .</s>

<s>in this play there were so many characters and so much detail .</s>

<s>Tom never knew how to condense , to boil down .</s>

<s>he was always concerned with life , and he tried to picture it whole ;
he wanted nothing compressed , tight .</s>

<s>he was a big man , and he wanted nothing little , squeezed ;
he despised parsimony , and particularly of words .</s>

<s>in this play there were some thirty or more named characters and I don't know how many more unnamed .</s>

<s>in describing it to Professor Baker after it had been chosen for production , he defended his great array of characters by declaring that he had included that many not because I didn't know how to save paint , but because the play required them .</s>

<s>and he threatened someday to write a play with fifty , eighty , a hundred people -- a whole town , a whole race , a whole epoch .</s>

<s>he said he would do it , though probably nobody would produce it , for his own soul's ease and comfort .</s>

<s>that summer Tom attended the summer session at Harvard , but he did not ask Mama to send him back in the fall .</s>

<s>instead , he went down to New York and submitted Welcome To Our City to the Theatre Guild , which had asked him to let them have a look at it after Professor Baker had recommended it highly .</s>

<s>he hung around New York , waiting to hear whether they would accept it for production and in that time came down to Asheville and also paid a short visit to Chapel Hill , where with almost childish delight he visited old friends and favorite campus spots .</s>

<s>on returning to New York he had a job for several weeks ;
it was visiting University of North Carolina alumni in New York to ask them for contributions to the Graham Memorial Building fund .</s>

<s>the Graham Memorial would be the campus student union honoring the late and much beloved Edward Kidder Graham , who had been president when Tom entered the university .</s>

<s>well , the Theatre Guild kept that play , and kept it , and finally in December they turned it down .</s>

<s>but they would reconsider it , they assured him , if he would rewrite it .</s>

<s>Tom told me about it , how one evening he went over to see the Theatre Guild man .</s>

<s>this man , Tom said , had the play shut up in his desk , I believe , and when Tom sat down , he pulled it out and apologetically told Tom that they wouldn't be able to use it .</s>

<s>Tom said he almost burst into tears , he was so disappointed and put out .</s>

<s>the man , Tom said , explained that it was not only too long and detailed but that as it stood it wasn't the sort of thing the public wanted .</s>

<s>the public , Tom said the man told him , wanted realism , and his play wasn't that .</s>

<s>it was fantastic writing , beautiful writing , the man declared , but the public , he insisted , wanted realism .</s>

<s>Tom was not willing to revise the play according to the plan the man suggested .</s>

<s>such a revision , he said , would ruin it , would change his whole conception of the play as well as the treatment .</s>

<s>he thought about it and he told the man he just couldn't do it over in accordance with the suggestions he had made .</s>

<s>it was not until we had returned to the city to live , while I was still at Brown and Sharpe's , that I felt the full impact of evangelical Christianity .</s>

<s>I came under the spell of a younger group in the church led by the pastor's older son .</s>

<s>the spirit of this group was that we were -- and are -- living in a world doomed to eternal punishment , but that God through Jesus Christ has provided a way of escape for those who confess their sins and accept salvation .</s>

<s>there are millions who accept this doctrine , but few indeed are those who accept it so truly that the fate of humanity lies as a weight on their souls night and day .</s>

<s>this group in Park Place Church was made up of the earnest few .</s>

<s>I was drawn deeper and deeper into these concerns and responsibilities .</s>

<s>I engaged more and more in religious activities .</s>

<s>besides Church and Sunday School I went to out-of-door meetings on the sidewalk at the church door .</s>

<s>I went to an afternoon service at the J .</s>

<s>I went to the Christian Endeavor Society and to the evening service of the church .</s>

<s>much of this lacked the active support of the pastor .</s>

<s>the young people were self-energizing , and I was energized .</s>

<s>once or twice my father asked me if I wasn't overdoing a bit in my churchgoing .</s>

<s>meanwhile I myself was not yet saved .</s>

<s>at least I had been unable to lay hold on the experience of conversion .</s>

<s>try as I might to confess my sins and accept salvation , no answer came to me from heaven .</s>

<s>finally , after years , I gave up .</s>

<s>the basic difficulty , I suppose , was in my ultimate inability to feel a burden of sin from which I sought relief .</s>

<s>I was familiar with Pilgrim's Progress , which I read as literature .</s>

<s>no load of sin had been laid on my shoulders , nor did earnest effort enable me to become conscious of one .</s>

<s>there is , of course , the doctrine of original sin , which asserts that each of us as individuals partakes of the guilt of our first ancestor .</s>

<s>in the rhyming catechism this doctrine is worded thus : in Adam's fall we sin-ned all .</s>

<s>this doctrine was repugnant to my moral sense .</s>

<s>I did not feel it presumptuous to expect that the Creator would be at least as just as the most righteous of His creatures ;
and the doctrine of original sin is compounded of injustice .</s>

<s>some of these thoughts -- not all of them -- have taken organized form in later years .</s>

<s>the actual impelling force which severed me from evangelical effort was of another sort .</s>

<s>I became disgusted at being so preoccupied with the state of my own miserable soul .</s>

<s>I found myself becoming one of that group of people who , in Carlyle's words , are forever gazing into their own navels , anxiously asking am I right , am I wrong ?</s>

<s>I bethought me of the Lord's Prayer , and these words came to mind : Thy kingdom come , Thy will be done , on earth as it is in heaven .</s>

<s>they have remained on the opened page of my mind in all the years which since have passed .</s>

<s>from that time to this my religious concern is that I might give effective help to the bringing in of God's kingdom on earth .</s>

<s>I do not claim to be free from sin , or from the need for repentance and forgiveness .</s>

<s>in my experience the assurance of forgiveness comes only when I have confessed to the wronged one and have made as full reparation as I can devise .</s>

<s>there was one further step in my religious progress .</s>

<s>this was taken after I came to live in Springfield , and it was made under the guidance of the Reverend Raymond Beardslee , a young preacher who came to the Congregational Church there at about the same time that I moved from New York .</s>

<s>his father was a professor at Hartford Theological Seminary , and from him he acquired a conviction , which he passed along to me , that there is in the universe of persons a moral law , the law of love , which is a natural law in the same sense as is the physical law .</s>

<s>it is most important that we recognize the law of love as being unbreakable in all personal relationships , whether individually , socially or as between whole nations of people .</s>

<s>if obeyed , the law brings order and satisfaction .</s>

<s>if disobeyed , the result is turmoil and chaos .</s>

<s>as we observe moral law and physical law they appear as being inevitable .</s>

<s>we can conceive of no alternatives .</s>

<s>their basis seems deeper than mere authority .</s>

<s>they are not true because scientists or prophets say they are true .</s>

<s>it is not the authority of God Himself which makes them true .</s>

<s>because God is what He is , the laws of the universe , material and spiritual , are what they are .</s>

<s>deity and Law are one and inseparable .</s>

<s>with this conviction , the partition between the sacred and the secular disappears .</s>

<s>one's daily work becomes sacred , since it is performed in the field of influence of the moral law , dealing as it does with people as well as with matter and energy .</s>

<s>in his book Civilization And Ethics Albert Schweitzer faces the moral problems which arise when moral law is recognized in business life , for example .</s>

<s>his Ethics defines possessions as the property of the community , of which the individual is sovereign steward .</s>

<s>one serves society by conducting a business from which a certain number of employees draw their means of subsistence ;
another by giving away his property in order to help his fellow man .</s>

<s>each will decide on his own course somewhere between these two extreme cases according to the sense of responsibility which is determined for him by the particular circumstances of his own life .</s>

<s>no one is to judge others .</s>

<s>he is uncompromising in assigning guilt to the man who finds it necessary to inflict or permit injury to one individual or group for the sake of a larger good .</s>

<s>for this decision a man must take personal responsibility .</s>

<s>says he , I may never imagine that in the struggle between personal and supra-personal responsibility it is possible to make a compromise between the ethical and the purposive in the shape of a relative ethic ;
or to let the ethical be superseded by the purposive .</s>

<s>on the contrary it is my duty to make my own decision as between the two .</s>

<s>Schweitzer seems , in fact , to acquire for himself a burden of sin , not bequeathed by Adam , but accumulated in the inevitable judgments which life requires of him as between greater and lesser responsibilities .</s>

<s>this viewpoint I find interesting , but it has never weighed on my soul .</s>

<s>perhaps it should have .</s>

<s>my own experience has followed simpler lines .</s>

<s>an uncompromising belief in the moral law has the advantage of making religion natural , even as physical law is natural .</s>

<s>neither the engineer nor the ordinary citizen feels any self-consciousness in obeying the laws of matter and energy , nor can he achieve a sense of self-righteousness in such obedience .</s>

<s>to obey the moral law is just ordinary common sense , applied to a neglected field .</s>

<s>religion thus becomes integrated with life .</s>

<s>this truth that the moral law is natural has other important corollaries .</s>

<s>one of them is that it gives meaning and purpose to life .</s>

<s>in seeking for such meaning and purpose , Albert Schweitzer seized upon the concept of the sacredness of life .</s>

<s>it is puzzling to the occidental mind ( to mine at least ) to assign sacredness to animal , insect , and plant life .</s>

<s>these lives are in themselves outside of the moral order and are unburdened with moral responsibility .</s>

<s>there is indeed a moral responsibility on man himself , for his own soul's sake , to respect lower life and to avoid the infliction of suffering , but this viewpoint Schweitzer rejects .</s>

<s>so far as sacredness inheres in any aspect of creation it seems to me to be found in human personality , whether in Lambarene , Africa , or in Washington , D.C. .</s>

<s>one cannot read the records of scientists , officials and travelers who have penetrated to the minds of the most savage races without realizing that each individual met with is a person .</s>

<s>read , for instance , in Malcolm MacDonald's Borneo People of Segura and her wise father Tomonggong Koh , and her final adjustment to encroaching civilization .</s>

<s>above all read in Jens Bjerre's The Last Cannibal Show the old man of the Wailbri tribe ( not cannibals ) in central Australia gave to the white man his choicest possession , while the tears streamed down his face .</s>

<s>the Australian aborigine is the conventional exemplar of degraded humanity ;
yet here was a depth of sensibility which is lacking in a considerable portion of the beneficiaries of our civilization .</s>

<s>persons , whether white , black , brown or yellow , are a concern of God .</s>

<s>respect for personality is a privilege and a duty for us as brothers .</s>

<s>such is the field for exercising our reverence .</s>

<s>as to our action , let us align ourselves with the purpose expressed by Jesus in the Lord's Prayer : Thy kingdom come , Thy will be done , on earth as it is in heaven .</s>

<s>with the knowledge that the kingdom comes by obedience to the moral law in our relations with all people , we have a firm intellectual grasp on both the means and the ends of our lives .</s>

<s>this intellectual approach to spiritual life suited me well , because I was never content to lead a divided life .</s>

<s>as I have said , words from Tennyson remain ever in my memory : that mind and soul , according well , may make one music as before .</s>

<s>let us now give some thought to the soul .</s>

<s>when the young biologist , Dr. Ballard , began to show interest in our daughter Elizabeth , this induced a corresponding interest , on our part , in him .</s>

<s>I asked one day what he was doing .</s>

<s>he told me that he had a big newt and a little newt and that he was transplanting a big eye of the big newt onto the little newt and a little eye of the little newt onto the big newt .</s>

<s>he was then noting that the big eye on the little newt hung back until the little eye had grown up to it , while the little eye on the big newt grew rapidly until it was as big as the other .</s>

<s>then I asked , what does that teach you ?</s>

<s>said he , it teaches me to wonder .</s>

<s>this was a profound statement .</s>

<s>in the face of the unfolding universe , our ultimate attitude is that of wonder .</s>

<s>wonder is indeed the intellectual gateway to the spiritual world .</s>

<s>gone are the days when , in the nineteenth century , scientists thought that they were close to the attainment of complete knowledge of the physical universe .</s>

<s>for them only a little more needed to be learned , and then all physical knowledge could be neatly sorted , packaged and put in the inventory to be drawn on for the solution of any human problem .</s>

<s>this complacency was blown to bits by the relativity of Einstein , the revelation of the complex anatomy of the atom and the discovery of the expanding universe .</s>

<s>none of these discoveries were neatly rounded off bits of knowledge .</s>

<s>each faded out into the unexplored areas of the future .</s>

<s>it is as if we , in our center of human observation , from time to time penetrate more deeply into the unknown .</s>

<s>as our radius of penetration , J , increases , the area of new knowledge increases by F , and the total of human knowledge becomes measured in terms of F .</s>

<s>wonder grows .</s>

<s>it is endless .</s>

<s>there are some people , intelligent people , who seem to be untouched by the sea of wonder in which we are immersed and in which we spend our lives .</s>

<s>one such is Abraham Meyer , the writer of a recent book , Speaking Of Man .</s>

<s>this is a straightforward denial of the spiritual world and a vigorous defense of pure materialism .</s>

<s>his inability to wonder vitiates his argument .</s>

<s>the subject of immortality brings to mind a vivid incident which took place in 1929 at Montreux in Switzerland .</s>

<s>criticism is as old as literary art and we can set the stage for our study of three moderns if we see how certain critics in the past have dealt with the ethical aspects of literature .</s>

<s>I have chosen five contrasting pairs , ten men in all , and they are arranged in roughly chronological order .</s>

<s>such a list must naturally be selective , and the treatment of each man is brief , for I am interested only in their general ideas on the moral measure of literature .</s>

<s>altogether , the list will give us considerable variety in attitudes and some typical ones , for these critics range all the way from censors to those who consider art above ethics , all the way from Plato to Poe .</s>

<s>and most of the great periods are represented , because we will compare Plato and Aristotle from the golden age of Greece ;
Stephen Gosson and Sir Philip Sidney from renaissance England ;
Dr. Johnson and William Hazlitt of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in England ;
and James Russell Lowell and Edgar Allan Poe of nineteenth century American letters .</s>

<s>Plato and Aristotle
Plato and Aristotle agree on some vital literary issues .</s>

<s>they both measure literature by moral standards , and in their political writings both allow for censorship , but the differences between them are also significant .</s>

<s>while Aristotle censors literature only for the young , Plato would banish all poets from his ideal state .</s>

<s>even more important , in his Poetics , Aristotle differs somewhat from Plato when he moves in the direction of treating literature as a unique thing , separate and apart from its causes and its effects .</s>

<s>all through The Republic , Plato attends to the way art relates to the general life and ultimately to a good life for his citizens .</s>

<s>in short , he is constantly concerned with the ethical effects .</s>

<s>when he discusses the subject matter of poetry , he asks what moral effect the scenes will have .</s>

<s>when he turns briefly to literary style , in the Third Book , he again looks to the effect on the audience .</s>

<s>he explains that his citizens must not be corrupted by any of the misrepresentations of the gods or heroes that one finds in much poetry , and he observes that all these pantomimic gentlemen will be sent to another state .</s>

<s>only those story tellers will remain who can imitate the style of the virtuous .</s>

<s>Plato is , at times , just as suspicious of the poets themselves as he is of their work .</s>

<s>when he discusses tyrants in the Eighth Book of The Republic , he pictures the poets as willing to praise the worst rulers .</s>

<s>but the most fundamental objection he has to poets appears in the Tenth Book , and it is derived from his doctrine of ideal forms .</s>

<s>in Plato's mind there is an irresolvable conflict between the poet and the philosopher , because the poet imitates only particular objects and is incapable of rising to the first level of abstraction , much less the highest level of ideal forms .</s>

<s>true reality , of course , is the ideal , and the poet knows nothing of this ;
only the philosopher knows the truth .</s>

<s>poets , moreover , dwell on human passions .</s>

<s>and with this point about the passions , we encounter Plato's dualism .</s>

<s>the same sort of thinking plays so large a part in both Babbitt and More , that we must examine it in some detail .</s>

<s>Plato feels that man has two competing aspects , his rational faculty and his irrational .</s>

<s>we can be virtuous only if we control our lower natures , the passions in this case , and strengthen our rational side ;
and poetry , with all its emphasis on the passions , encourages the audience to give way to emotion .</s>

<s>for this reason , then , poetry tends to weaken the power of control , the reason , because it tempts one to indulge his passions , and even the best of men , he maintains , may be corrupted by this subtle influence .</s>

<s>Plato's attitude toward poetry has always been something of an enigma , because he is so completely sensitive to its charm .</s>

<s>his whole objection , indeed , seems to rise out of a deep conviction that the poets do have great power to influence , but Plato seldom pays any attention to what might be called the poem itself .</s>

<s>he is , rather , concerned with the effect on society and he wants the poets to join his fight for justice .</s>

<s>he wants them to use their great power to strengthen man's rational side , to teach virtue , and to encourage religion .</s>

<s>while Plato finally allows a few acceptable hymns to the gods and famous men , still he clearly leaves the way open for further discussion of the issue .</s>

<s>he even calls upon the poets to defend the Muse and to show that poetry may contribute to virtue .</s>

<s>he says : we may further grant to those of her ( Poetry's ) defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets , the permission to speak in prose on her behalf : let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to States and to human life , and we will listen in a kindly spirit ;
for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers -- I mean , if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight .</s>

<s>when we turn to Aristotle's ideas on the moral measure of literature , it is at once apparent that he is at times equally concerned about the influence of the art .</s>

<s>in the ideal state , for instance , he argues that the young citizens should hear only the most carefully selected tales and stories .</s>

<s>for this reason , he would banish indecent pictures and speeches from the stage ;
and the young people should not even be permitted to see comedies till they are old enough to drink strong wine and sit at the public tables .</s>

<s>by the time they reach that age , however , Aristotle no longer worries about the evil influence of comedies .</s>

<s>in Aristotle's analysis of tragedy in the Poetics , we find an attempt to isolate the art , to consider only those things proper to it , to discover how it differs from other arts , and to deal with the effects peculiar to it .</s>

<s>he assures us , early in the Poetics , that all art is imitation and that all imitation gives pleasure , but he distinguishes between art in general and poetic art on the basis of the means , manner , and the objects of the imitation .</s>

<s>once the poetic arts are separated from the other forms , he lays down his famous definition of tragedy , which sets up standards and so lends direction to the remainder of the work .</s>

<s>a tragedy , by his definition , is an imitation of an action that is serious , of a certain magnitude , and complete in itself .</s>

<s>it should have a dramatic form with pleasing language , and it should portray incidents which so arouse pity and fear that it purges these emotions in the audience .</s>

<s>any tragedy , he maintains , has six elements : plot , character , and thought ( the objects of imitation ) , diction and melody ( the means of imitation ) , and spectacle ( the manner of imitation ) .</s>

<s>throughout the rest of the Poetics , Aristotle continues to discuss the characteristics of these six parts and their interrelationship , and he refers frequently to the standards suggested by his definition of tragedy .</s>

<s>Aristotle's method in the Poetics , then , does suggest that we should isolate the work .</s>

<s>the Chicago contingent of modern critics follow Aristotle so far in this direction that it is hard to see how they can compare one poem with another for the purpose of evaluation .</s>

<s>but there are , however , several features of Aristotle's approach which open the way for the moral measure of literature .</s>

<s>for one thing , Aristotle mentions that plays may corrupt the audience .</s>

<s>in addition , his definition of a tragedy invites our attention , because a serious and important action may very well be one that tests the moral fiber of the author or of the characters .</s>

<s>and there is one other point in the Poetics that invites moral evaluation : Aristotle's notion that the distinctive function of tragedy is to purge one's emotions by arousing pity and fear .</s>

<s>he rejects certain plots because they do not contribute to that end .</s>

<s>the point is that an ethical critic , with an assist from Freud , can seize on this theory to argue that tragedy provides us with a harmless outlet for our hostile urges .</s>

<s>in his study Samuel Johnson , Joseph Wood Krutch takes this line when he says that what Aristotle really means by his theory of catharsis is that our evil passions may be so purged by the dramatic ritual that it is less likely that we shall indulge them through our own acts .</s>

<s>in Krutch's view , this is one way to show how literature may be moral in effect without employing the explicit methods of a moralist .</s>

<s>and we can add that Krutch's interpretation of purgation is also one answer to Plato's fear that poetry will encourage our passions .</s>

<s>if Krutch is correct , tragedy may have quite the opposite effect .</s>

<s>it may allay our passions and so restore the rule of reason .</s>

<s>or in more Freudian terms , the experience may serve to sublimate our destructive urges and strengthen the ego and superego .</s>

<s>Gosson and Sidney the second half of the sixteenth century in England was the setting for a violent and long controversy over the moral quality of renaissance literature , especially the drama .</s>

<s>no one suggested that the ethical effects of the art were irrelevant .</s>

<s>both sides agreed that the theater must stand a moral test , but they could not agree on whether the poets were a good or a bad influence .</s>

<s>both sides claimed that Plato and Aristotle supported their cause .</s>

<s>those who wanted to close the theaters , for example , pointed to Plato's Republic and those who wished to keep them open called on the Plato of the Ion to testify in their behalf .</s>

<s>the most famous document that comes out of this dispute is perhaps Sir Philip Sidney's An Apologie For Poetrie , published in 1595 .</s>

<s>many students of literature know that classical defense .</s>

<s>what is not so well known , however , and what is quite important for understanding the issues of this early quarrel , is the kind of attack on literature that Sidney was answering .</s>

<s>for this reason , then I want to describe , first , two examples of the puritanical attacks : Stephen Gosson's The School Of Abuse , 1579 , and his later Playes Confuted , published in 1582 .</s>

<s>second , we will see how Sidney answered the charges , for while Sidney's essay was not specifically a reply to Gosson , his arguments do support the new theater .</s>

<s>according to William Ringler's study , Stephen Gosson , the theater business in London had become a thriving enterprise by 1577 , and , in the opinion of many , a thoroughly bad business .</s>

<s>aroused by what they considered an evil influence , some members of the clergy , joined by city authorities , merchants , and master craftsmen , began the attack on the plays and the actors for what they called the abuses of the art , but by 1582 some of them began to denounce the whole idea of acting .</s>

<s>although this kind of wholesale objection came at first from some men who were not technically Puritans , still , once the Puritans gained power , they climaxed the affair by passing the infamous ordinance of 1642 which decreed that all public stage-plays shall cease and be forborne .</s>

<s>with that act of Parliament the opponents of the stage won the day , and for more than two decades after that England had no legitimate public drama .</s>

<s>in the early days of this controversy over the theater one of the interested parties , Stephen Gosson , published a little tract in which he objected mildly to the abuses of art , rather than the art itself .</s>

<s>but his opposition hardened and by 1579 , in The School Of Abuse , he was ready to banish all players .</s>

<s>he advises women to beware of those places which in sorrows cheere you and beguile you in mirth .</s>

<s>he does not really approve of levity and laughter , but sex is the deadly sin .</s>

<s>he warns that a single glance can lead us into temptation , for looking eies have lyking hartes , and lyking hartes may burne in lust .</s>

<s>but it would not be very satisfactory to leave our conclusions at the point just reached .</s>

<s>fortunately , it is possible to be somewhat more concrete and factual in diagnosing the involvement of values in education .</s>

<s>for this purpose we now draw upon data from sociological and psychological studies of students in American colleges and universities , and particularly from the Cornell Values Studies .</s>

<s>in the latter research program , information is available for 2,758 Cornell students surveyed in 1950 and for 1,571 students surveyed in 1952 .</s>

<s>of the latter sample , 944 persons had been studied two years earlier ;
hence changes in attitudes and values can be analyzed for identical individuals at two points in time .</s>

<s>in addition , the 1952 study collected comparable data from 4,585 students at ten other colleges and universities scattered across the country : Dartmouth , Harvard , Yale , Wesleyan , North Carolina , Fisk , Texas , University of California at Los Angeles , Wayne , and Michigan .</s>

<s>we find , in the first place , that the students overwhelmingly approve of higher education , positively evaluate the job their own institution is doing , do not accept most of the criticisms levelled against higher education in the public prints , and , on the whole , approve of the way their university deals with value-problems and value inculcation .</s>

<s>it is not our impression that these evaluations are naively uncritical resultants of blissful ignorance ;
rather , the generality of these students find their university experience congenial to their own sense of values .</s>

<s>students are approximately equally divided between those who regard vocational preparation as the primary goal of an ideal education and those who chose a general liberal education .</s>

<s>other conceivable goals , such as character-education and social adjustment , are of secondary importance to them .</s>

<s>the ideal of a liberal education impresses itself upon the students more and more as they move through college .</s>

<s>even in such technical curricula as engineering , the senior is much more likely than the freshman to choose , as an ideal , liberal education over specific vocational preparation .</s>

<s>in the university milieu of scholarship and research , of social diversity , of new ideas and varied and wide-ranging interests , socialization into a campus culture apparently means heightened appreciation of the idea of a liberal education in the arts and sciences .</s>

<s>students' choices of ideal educational goals are not arbitrary or whimsical .</s>

<s>there is a clear relationship between their educational evaluations and their basic pattern of general values .</s>

<s>the selective and directional qualities of basic value-orientations are clearly evident in these data : the success-oriented students choose vocational preparation , the other-directed choose goals of social adjustment ( getting along with people ) , the intellectuals choose a liberal arts emphasis .</s>

<s>the same patterned consistency shows itself in occupational choices .</s>

<s>there is impressive consistency between specific occupational preferences and the student's basic conception of what is for him a good way of life .</s>

<s>and , contrary to many popular assertions , the goal-values chosen do not seem to us to be primarily oriented to materialistic success nor to mere conformity .</s>

<s>our students want occupations that permit them to use their talents and training , to be creative and original , to work with and to help other people .</s>

<s>they also want money , prestige , and security .</s>

<s>but they are optimistic about their prospects in these regards ;
they set limits to their aspirations -- few aspire to millions of dollars or to imperial power and glory .</s>

<s>within the fixed frame of these aspirations , they can afford to place a high value on the expressive and people-oriented aspects of occupation and to minimize the instrumental-reward values of power , prestige , and wealth .</s>

<s>occupational choices are also useful -- and interesting -- in bringing out clearly that values do not constitute the only component in goals and aspirations .</s>

<s>for there is also the face of reality in the form of the individual's perceptions of his own abilities and interests , of the objective possibilities open to him , of the familial and other social pressures to which he is exposed .</s>

<s>we find reluctant recruits whose values are not in line with their expected occupation's characteristics .</s>

<s>students develop occupational images -- not always accurate or detailed -- and they try to fit their values to the presumed characteristics of the imagined occupation .</s>

<s>the purely cognitive or informational problems are often acute .</s>

<s>furthermore , many reluctant recruits are yielding to social demands , or compromising in the face of their own limitations of opportunity , or of ability and performance .</s>

<s>thus , many a creativity-oriented aspirant for a career in architecture , drama , or journalism , resigns himself to a real estate business ;
many a people-oriented student who dreams of the M.D.</s>

<s>decides to enter his father's advertising agency ;
and many a hopeful incipient business executive decides it were better to teach the theory of business administration than to practice it .</s>

<s>the old ideal of the independent entrepreneur is extant -- but so is the recognition that the main chance may be in a corporate bureaucracy .</s>

<s>in their views on dating , courtship , sex , and family life , our students prefer what they are expected to prefer .</s>

<s>for them , in the grim words of a once-popular song , love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage .</s>

<s>their expressed standards concerning sex roles , desirable age for marriage , characteristics of an ideal mate , number of children desired are congruent with the values and stereotypes of the preceding generation -- minus compulsive rebellion .</s>

<s>they even accept the double standard of sex morality in a double sense , i.e.</s>

<s>, both sexes agree that standards for men differ from standards for women , and women apply to both sexes a standard different from that held by men .</s>

<s>conservatism and traditionalism seem implied by what has just been said .</s>

<s>but these terms are treacherous .</s>

<s>in the field of political values , it is certainly true that students are not radical , not rebels against their parents or their peers .</s>

<s>and as they go through college , the students tend to bring their political position in line with that prevalent in the social groups to which they belong .</s>

<s>yet they have accepted most of the extant welfare state provisions for health , security , and the regulation of economic affairs , and they overwhelmingly approve of the traditional liberalism of the Bill of Rights .</s>

<s>when their faith in civil liberties is tested against strong pressures of social expediency in specific issues , e.g.</s>

<s>, suppression of dangerous ideas , many waver and give in .</s>

<s>the students who are most willing to acquiesce in the suppression of civil liberties are also those who are most likely to be prejudiced against minority groups , to be conformist and traditionalistic in general social attitudes , and to lack a basic faith in people .</s>

<s>as one looks at the existing evidence , one finds a correlation , although only a slight one , between high grades and libertarian values .</s>

<s>but the correlation is substantial only among upperclassmen .</s>

<s>in other words , as students go through college , those who are most successful academically tend to become more committed to a Bill of Rights orientation .</s>

<s>college in gross -- just the general experience -- may have varying effects , but the students who are successful emerge with strengthened and clarified democratic values .</s>

<s>this finding is consistent also with the fact that student leaders are more likely to be supporters of the values implicit in civil liberties than the other students .</s>

<s>there is now substantial evidence from several major studies of college students that the experience of the college years results in a certain , selective homogenization of attitudes and values .</s>

<s>detached from their prior statuses and social groups and exposed to the pervasive stimuli of the university milieu , the students tend to assimilate a new common culture , to converge toward norms characteristic of their own particular campus .</s>

<s>furthermore , in certain respects , there are norms common to colleges and universities across the country .</s>

<s>for instance , college-educated people consistently show up in study after study as more often than others supporters of the Bill of Rights and other democratic rights and liberties .</s>

<s>the interesting thing in this connection is that the norms upon which students tend to converge include toleration of diversity .</s>

<s>to the extent that our sampling of the orientations of American college students in the years 1950 and 1952 may be representative of our culture -- and still valid in 1959 -- we are disposed to question the summary characterization of the current generation as silent , beat , apathetic , or as a mass of other-directed conformists who are guided solely by social radar without benefit of inner gyroscopes .</s>

<s>our data indicate that these students of today do basically accept the existing institutions of the society , and , in the face of the realities of complex and large-scale economic and political problems , make a wary and ambivalent delegation of trust to those who occupy positions of legitimized responsibility for coping with such collective concerns .</s>

<s>in a real sense they are admittedly conservative , but their conservatism incorporates a traditionalized embodiment of the original radicalism of 1776 .</s>

<s>although we have no measures of its strength or intensity , the heritage of the doctrine of inalienable rights is retained .</s>

<s>as they move through the college years our young men and women are socialized into a broadly similar culture , at the level of personal behavior .</s>

<s>in this sense also , they are surely conformists .</s>

<s>it is even true that some among them use the sheer fact of conformity -- everyone does it -- as a criterion for conduct .</s>

<s>but the extent of ethical robotism is easily overestimated .</s>

<s>few students are really so faceless in the not-so-lonely crowd of the swelling population in our institutions of higher learning .</s>

<s>and it may be well to recall that to say conformity is , in part , another way of saying orderly human society .</s>

<s>in the field of religious beliefs and values , the college students seem to faithfully reflect the surrounding culture .</s>

<s>their commitments are , for the most part , couched in a familiar idiom .</s>

<s>students testify to a felt need for a religious faith or ultimate personal philosophy .</s>

<s>avowed atheists or freethinkers are so rare as to be a curiosity .</s>

<s>the religious quest is often intense and deep , and there are students on every campus who are seriously wrestling with the most profound questions of meaning and value .</s>

<s>at the same time , a major proportion of these young men and women see religion as a means of personal adjustment , an anchor for family life , a source of emotional security .</s>

<s>these personal and social goals often overshadow the goals of intellectual clarity , and spiritual transcendence .</s>

<s>the cult of adjustment does exist .</s>

<s>it exists alongside the acceptance of traditional forms of organized religion ( church , ordained personnel , ritual , dogma ) .</s>

<s>still another segment of the student population consists of those who seek , in what they regard as religion , intellectual clarity , rational belief , and ethical guidance and reinforcement .</s>

<s>our first impression of the data was that the students were surprisingly orthodox and religiously involved .</s>

<s>upon second thought we were forced to realize that we have very few reliable historical benchmarks against which we might compare the present situation , and that conclusions that present-day students are more or less religious could not be defended on the basis of our data .</s>

<s>as we looked more intently at the content of our belief and the extent of religious participation , we received the impression that many of the religious convictions expressed represented a conventional acceptance , of low intensity .</s>

<s>but , here again , comparative benchmarks are lacking , and we do not know , in any case , what measure of profoundity and intensity to expect from healthy , young , secure and relatively inexperienced persons ;
after all , feelings of immortality and invulnerability are standard illusions of youth .</s>

<s>nor are optimistic and socially-oriented themes at all rare in the distinctive religious history of this country .</s>

<s>Kluckhohn recently has summarized evidence regarding changes in values during a period of years , primarily 1935-1955 , but extending much farther back in some instances .</s>

<s>a variety of data are assembled to bear upon such alleged changes as diminished puritan morality , work-success ethic , individualism , achievement , lessened emphasis on future-time orientation in favor of sociability , moral relativism , consideration and tolerance , conformity , hedonistic present-time orientation .</s>

<s>although he questions the extent and nature of the alleged revival of religion and the alleged increase in conformity , and thinks that hedonistic present-time orientation does not have the meaning usually attributed to it , he does conclude that Americans increasingly enjoy leisure without guilt , do not stress achievement so much as formerly , are more accepting of group harmony as a goal , more tolerant of diversity and aware of other cultures .</s>

<s>from New Jersey , Morgan hastened to the headquarters of Washington at Whitemarsh , Pennsylvania , arriving there on November 18th .</s>

<s>there was much sickness in the corps , and the men were , in addition , without the clothing , shoes , and blankets needed for the winter weather .</s>

<s>Morgan himself had sciatica again .</s>

<s>even on his tough constitution , the exposure and strenuous activity were beginning to tell in earnest .</s>

<s>on the morning of November 17th , Cornwallis and 2,000 men had left Philadelphia with the object of capturing Fort Mercer at Red Bank , New Jersey .</s>

<s>in order to prevent this , Washington hastened to dispatch several units to reinforce the fort , including a force under the Marquis De Lafayette containing some 160 of Morgan's riflemen , all who were fit for duty at this time , the rest having no shoes .</s>

<s>although the fort was evacuated in the face of the force of Cornwallis , Morgan and his men did have a chance to take another swing at the redcoats .</s>

<s>a picket guard of about 350 , mostly Hessians , were attacked by the Americans under Lafayette , and driven back to their camp , some twenty to thirty of them falling before the riflemen's fire .</s>

<s>I never saw men , Lafayette declared in regard to the riflemen , so merry , so spirited , and so desirous to go on to the enemy , whatever force they might have , as that small party in this fight .</s>

<s>Nathanael Greene told Washington that Lafayette was charmed with the spirited behavior of the militia and riflemen .</s>

<s>a few days later it was learned that General Howe was planning an attack upon the American camp .</s>

<s>the British general moved his forces north from Philadelphia to Chestnut Hill , near the right wing of the patriot encampment .</s>

<s>here the Pennsylvania militia skirmished with the British , but soon fled .</s>

<s>Morgan was ordered to attack the enemy , who had meantime moved to Edge Hill on the left of the Americans .</s>

<s>similar orders were given to the Maryland militia .</s>

<s>Morgan immediately disposed his troops for action and found he had not long to wait .</s>

<s>a body of redcoats were seen marching down a nearby slope , a tempting target for the riflemen , who threw a volley into their ranks and messed up the smart formation considerably .</s>

<s>now the riflemen and the Marylanders followed up their beginning and closed in on the British , giving them another telling round of fire .</s>

<s>the redcoats ran like rabbits .</s>

<s>but the Maryland militia had likewise fled , all too typical of this type of soldier during the Revolution , an experience which gave Morgan little confidence in militia in general , as he watched other instances of their breaking in hot engagements .</s>

<s>the British , although suffering considerable losses , noted the defection of the Marylanders , made a stand , then turned and attacked Morgan who became greatly outnumbered and had to retire .</s>

<s>the Americans lost forty-four men , among them Major Joseph Morris of Morgan's regiment , an officer who was regarded with high esteem and affection , not only by his commander , but by Washington and Lafayette as well .</s>

<s>the latter was so upset on learning of the death of Morris , that he wrote Morgan a letter , showing his own warmhearted generosity .</s>

<s>after complimenting Morgan and the riflemen and saying he was praising them to Congress , too , the ardent Frenchman added he felt that Congress should make some financial restitution to the widow and family of Morris , but that he knew Morgan realized how long such action usually required , if it was done at all .</s>

<s>as Mrs. Morris may be in some want before that time , Lafayette continued , I am going to trouble you with a commission which I beg you will execute with the greatest secrecy .</s>

<s>if she wanted to borrow any sum of money in expecting the arrangements of Congress , it would not become a stranger , unknown to her , to offer himself for that purpose .</s>

<s>but you could ( as from yourself ) tell her that you had friends who , being with the army , don't know what to do with their money and would willingly let her have one or many thousand dollars .</s>

<s>this was accordingly done , and the plight of the grateful Mrs. Morris was much relieved as a result of the generous loan , the amount of which is not known .</s>

<s>apparently still sensitive about the idea with which General Gates had approached him at Saratoga , namely , that George Washington be replaced , Morgan was vehement in his support of the commander-in-chief during the campaign around Philadelphia .</s>

<s>Richard Peters , Secretary of the Board of War , thought Morgan was so extreme on the subject that he accused him of trying to pick a quarrel .</s>

<s>Morgan hotly denied this and informed the Board of War that the men in camp linked the name of Peters with the plot against Washington .</s>

<s>Peters insisted that this impression was a great misunderstanding , and evidently , from the quarrel , obtained an unfavorable impression of Morgan's judgment .</s>

<s>such a situation regarding the Board of War could hardly have helped Morgan's chances for promotion when that matter came before the group later on .</s>

<s>in late December , the American army moved from Whitemarsh to Valley Forge , and although the distance was only 13 miles , the journey took more than a week because of the bad weather , the barefooted and almost naked men .</s>

<s>the position of the new camp was admirably selected and well fortified , its easily defensible nature being one good reason why Howe did not attack it .</s>

<s>besides helping to prevent the movement of the British to the west , Valley Forge also obstructed the trade between Howe's forces and the farmers , thus threatening the vital subsistence of the redcoats and rendering their foraging to obtain necessary supplies extremely hazardous .</s>

<s>in order to see that this hindering situation remained effective , Washington detached several bodies of his troops to the periphery of the Philadelphia area .</s>

<s>Morgan and his corps were placed on the west side of the Schuylkill River , with instructions to intercept all supplies found going to the city and to keep a close eye on the movements of the enemy .</s>

<s>the headquarters of Morgan was on a farm , said to have been particularly well located so as to prevent the farmers nearby from trading with the British , a practice all too common to those who preferred to sell their produce for British gold rather than the virtually worthless Continental currency .</s>

<s>in his dealings with offenders , however , Morgan was typically firm but just .</s>

<s>for example , he captured some persons from York County , who with teams were taking to Philadelphia the furniture of a man who had just been released from prison through the efforts of his wife , and who apparently was helpless to prevent the theft of his household goods .</s>

<s>Morgan took charge of the furniture and restored it to its thankful owners , but he let the culprits who had stolen it go free .</s>

<s>Morgan complained to Washington about the men detailed to him for scouting duty , most of them he said being useless .</s>

<s>they straggle at such a rate , he told the commander-in-chief , that if the enemy were enterprising , they might get two from us , when we would take one of them , which makes me wish General Howe would go on , lest any incident happen to us .</s>

<s>if the hardships of the winter at Valley Forge were trying for healthy men , they were , of course , much more so for those not in good health .</s>

<s>Daniel Morgan's rheumatic condition worsened with the increase of the cold and damp weather .</s>

<s>he had braved the elements and the enemy , but the strain , aided by the winter , was catching up with him at last .</s>

<s>also , he was now forty-three years old .</s>

<s>the mild activity of his command during the sojourn of the troops at Valley Forge could be handled by a subordinate , he felt , so like Henry Knox , equally loyal to Washington , who went to Boston at this time , Morgan received permission to visit his home in Virginia for several weeks .</s>

<s>in his absence , the rifle regiment was under the command of Major Thomas Posey , another able Virginian .</s>

<s>but Morgan did not leave before he had written a letter to a William Pickman in Salem , Massachusetts , apparently an acquaintance , praising Washington and saying that the slanders propagated about him were opposed by the general current of the people to exalt General Gates at the expense of General Washington was injurious to the latter .</s>

<s>if there be a disinterested patriot in America , 'tis General Washington , and his bravery , none can question .</s>

<s>it is doubtful if Morgan was able to take home much money to his wife and children , for his pay , as shown by the War Department Abstracts of early 1778 was $75 a month as a colonel , and that apt to be delayed .</s>

<s>he was shown a warm welcome regardless , and spent the time in Winchester recuperating from his ailment , enjoying his family and arranging his private affairs which were , of course , run down .</s>

<s>his neighbors celebrated his return , even if it was only temporary , and Morgan was especially gratified by the quaint expression of an elderly friend , Isaac Lane , who told him , a man that has so often left all that is dear to him , as thou hast , to serve thy country , must create a sympathetic feeling in every patriotic heart .</s>

<s>there must have been special feelings of joy and patriotism in the heart of Daniel Morgan too , when the news was received on April 30th of the recognition by France of the independence of the United States .</s>

<s>his fellow Virginian , George Washington , had stated , I believe no event was ever received with more heartfelt joy .</s>

<s>the dreary camp at Valley Forge was turned into an arena of rejoicing .</s>

<s>even the dignified Washington indulged in a game of wickets with some children .</s>

<s>his soldiers on the whole did not celebrate so mildly .</s>

<s>on May 6th , Morgan , who had returned , received from Washington orders to send out patrols under vigilant officers to keep near the enemy .</s>

<s>the reason for this , the orders said , is that the enemy may think to take advantage of the celebration of this day .</s>

<s>the troops must have more than the common quantity of liquor , and perhaps there will be some little drunkenness among them .</s>

<s>apparently no serious disorders resulted from the celebration , and within a few days , Morgan joined the force of Lafayette who now had command of some 2,000 men at Barren Hill , not far above Philadelphia on the Schuylkill .</s>

<s>the Frenchman had been ordered to approach the enemy's lines , harass them and get intelligence of their movements .</s>

<s>interestingly enough , the order transmitted to Morgan through Alexander Hamilton also informed him that a party of Indians will join the party to be sent from your command at Whitemarsh , and act with them .</s>

<s>these were Oneida Indians .</s>

<s>Washington evidently was anxious for Morgan to be cautious as well as aggressive , for on May 17th , 18th and 20th he admonished the leader of the riflemen-rangers to be on the alert .</s>

<s>obviously the commander-in-chief had confidence that Morgan would furnish him good intelligence too , for on the 23rd of May , he told Morgan that the British were prepared to move , perhaps in the night , and asked Morgan to have two of his best horses ready to dispatch to General Smallwood with the intelligence obtained .</s>

<s>meantime , however , this same General Smallwood seemed to be serving chivalry as well as the American army .</s>

<s>Colonel Benjamin Ford wrote to Morgan from Wilmington that he understood a Mrs. Sanderson from Maryland had obtained permission from Smallwood to visit Philadelphia , and would return on May 26th , escorted by several officers from Maryland belonging to the new levies in the British service .</s>

<s>Ford urged Morgan to capture these men , who , he thought , might be disguised as Quakers or peasants .</s>

<s>Morgan took the suggested steps , but when Mrs. Sanderson appeared , there was nobody with her but her husband , whom he promptly sent to headquarters to be questioned .</s>

<s>but Morgan evidently reported matters of intelligence much more important to his commanding general .</s>

<s>a letter of a few days later from Washington's aide to Morgan stated , his Excellency is highly pleased with your conduct upon this occasion .</s>

<s>for by now the original cause of the quarrel , Philip's seizure of Gascony , was only one strand in the spider web of French interests that overlay all western Europe and that had been so well and closely spun that the lightest movement could set it trembling from one end to the other .</s>

<s>even so , Edward's ambassadors can scarcely have foreseen that five years of unremitting work lay ahead of them before peace was finally made and that when it did come the countless embassies that left England for Rome during that period had very little to do with it .</s>

<s>it is hard not to lay most of the blame for their failures on the pope .</s>

<s>Nogaret is hardly an impartial witness , and even he did not make his charges against Boniface until the latter was dead , but there is some truth in what he said and more in what he did not say .</s>

<s>it was not merely a hunger for money , gold and precious objects that delayed the papal pronouncement that could have brought the war to an end ;
the pope was playing a dangerous game , with so many balls in the air at once that a misstep would bring them all about his ears , and his only hope was to temporize so that he could take advantage of every change in the delicate balance of European affairs .</s>

<s>when the negotiations began , his quarrel with the king of France was temporarily in abeyance , and he had no intention of reviving it so long as there was hope that French money would come to pay the troops who , under Charles of Valois , the papal vicar of Tuscany , were so valuable in the crusade against the Colonna cardinals and their Sicilian allies .</s>

<s>if his circumspection in regard to Philip's sensibilities went so far that he even refused to grant a dispensation for the marriage of Amadee's daughter , Agnes , to the son of the dauphin of Vienne -- a truly peacemaking move according to thirteenth-century ideas , for Savoy and Dauphine were as usual fighting on opposite sides -- for fear that he might seem to be favoring the anti-French coalition , he would certainly never take the far more drastic step of ordering the return of Gascony to Edward , even though , as he admitted to the English ambassadors , he had been advised that the original cession was invalid .</s>

<s>on the other hand , he did not want to offend Edward either , and he found himself in a very difficult position .</s>

<s>on the surface , the whole question was purely feudal .</s>

<s>the French were now occupying Gascony and Flanders on the technical grounds that their rulers had forfeited them by a breach of the feudal contract .</s>

<s>but Edward was invading Scotland for precisely the same reason , and his insubordinate vassal was the ally of the king of France .</s>

<s>Boniface had to uphold the sacredness of the feudal contract at all costs , for it was only as suzerain of Sicily and of the Patrimony of Peter that he had any justification for his Italian wars , but in the English-Scottish-French triangle it was almost impossible for him to recognize the claims of any one of the contestants without seeming to invalidate those of the other two .</s>

<s>because of these involvements in the matter at stake , Boniface lacked the impartiality that is supposed to be an essential qualification for the position of arbiter , and in retrospect that would seem to be sufficient reason why the English embassies to the Curia proved so fruitless .</s>

<s>but when the situation was so complicated that even Nogaret , one of the principal actors in the drama , could misinterpret the pope's motives , it is possible that Othon and his companions , equally baffled , attributed their difficulties to a more immediate cause .</s>

<s>this was Boniface's monumental tactlessness .</s>

<s>tact , by its very derivation , implies that its possessor keeps in touch with other people , but the author of Clericis Laicos Unam Sanctam , the wielder of the two swords , the papal sun of which the imperial moon was but a dim reflection , the peer of Caesar and vice-regent of Christ , was so high above other human beings that he had forgotten what they were like .</s>

<s>he was a learned and brilliant man , one of the best jurists in Europe and with flashes of penetrating insight , and yet in his dealings with other people , particularly when he tried to be ingratiating , he was capable of an abysmal stupidity that can have come only from a complete incomprehension of human nature and human motives .</s>

<s>this lofty disregard for others was not shared by such men as Pierre Flotte and his associates , that brilliant group of mediocre men , as Powicke calls them , who provided the brains for the French embassy that came to Rome under the nominal leadership of the archbishop of Narbonne , the duke of Burgundy , and the count of St.-Pol .</s>

<s>they had risen from humble beginnings by their own diligence and astuteness , they were unfettered by the codes that bound nobles like Othon or even the older generation of clerks like Hotham , and they were working for an end that their opponents had never even visualized .</s>

<s>Boniface was later to explain to the English that Robert of Burgundy and Guy De St.-Pol were easy enough to do business with ;
it was the clerks who caused the mischief and who made him say that the ruling passion of their race was covetousness and that in dealing with them he never knew whether he had to do with a Frenchman or with a devil .</s>

<s>to the pope , head of the universal Church , to the duke of Burgundy , taking full advantage of his position on the borders of France and of the Empire , or to Othon , who found it quite natural that he should do homage to Edward for Tipperary and to the count of Savoy for Grandson , Flotte's outspoken nationalism was completely incomprehensible .</s>

<s>and yet he made no pretense about it ;
when the pope , trying no doubt to appeal to his better nature , said to him , you have already taken Normandy .</s>

<s>do you want to drive the king of England from all his overseas possessions ?</s>

<s>the Frenchman's answer was a terse vous dites vrai .</s>

<s>loyal and unscrupulous , with a single-minded ambition to which he devoted all his energies , he outmatched the English diplomats time and time again until , by a kind of poetic justice , he fell at the battle of Courtrai , the victim of the equally nationalistic if less articulate Flemings .</s>

<s>the English , relying on a prejudiced arbiter and confronted with superior diplomatic skill , were also hampered in their negotiations by the events that were taking place at home .</s>

<s>the Scots had found a new leader in William Wallace , and Edward's yearly expeditions across the Border called for evermounting taxes , which only increased his difficulties with the barons and the clergy .</s>

<s>he was unable to send any more help to his allies on the Continent , and during the next few years many of them , left to resist French pressure unaided , surrendered to the inevitable and made their peace with Philip .</s>

<s>the defeat and death of Adolf of Nassau at the hands of Albert of Habsburg also worked to the disadvantage of the English , for all the efforts to revive the anti-French coalition came to nothing when Philip made an alliance with the new king of the Romans .</s>

<s>these shifts in alliance and allegiance not only increased the difficulties confronting the English embassy as a whole , but also directly involved the two Savoyards , Amadee and Othon .</s>

<s>in spite of the armistice negotiated by Amadee two years earlier , the war between Bishop Guillaume of Lausanne and Louis of Savoy was still going on , and although little is known about it , that little proves that it was yet another phase of the struggle against French expansion and was closely interwoven with the larger conflict .</s>

<s>a second truce had been arbitrated in April , 1298 , by Jean D'Arlay , lord of Chalon-sur-Saone , the most staunch of Edward's Burgundian allies , and these last were represented in the discussions at the Curia by Gautier de Montfaucon , Othon's neighbor and a member of the Vaudois coalition .</s>

<s>but although in many of these discussions Othon and Amadee might have been tempted to consider their own interests as well as those of the king , Edward's confidence in them was so absolute that they were made the acknowledged leaders of the embassy .</s>

<s>Amadee may have owed this partly to his relationship with the king , but Othon , who at sixty seems still to have been a simple knight , merited his position solely by his own character and ability .</s>

<s>the younger men , Vere , and Pembroke , who was also Edward's cousin and whose Lusignan blood gave him the swarthy complexion that caused Edward of Carnarvon's irreverent friend , Piers Gaveston , to nickname him Joseph the Jew , were relatively new to the game of diplomacy , but Pontissara had been on missions to Rome before , and Hotham , a man of great learning , jocund in speech , agreeable to meet , of honest religion , and pleasing in the eyes of all , and an archbishop to boot , was as reliable and experienced as Othon himself .</s>

<s>but all the reports of this first embassy show that the two Savoyards were the heads of it , for they were the only ones who were empowered to swear for the king that he would abide by the pope's decision and who were allowed to appoint deputies in the event that one was unavoidably absent .</s>

<s>this also gave them the unpleasant duty of being spokesmen for the mission , and they could foresee that that would not be easy .</s>

<s>underneath all the high-sounding phrases of royal and papal letters and behind the more down-to-earth instructions to the envoys was the inescapable fact that Edward would have to desert his Flemish allies and leave them to the vengeance of their indignant suzerain , the king of France , in return for being given an equally free hand with the insubordinate Scots .</s>

<s>this was a doubly bitter blow to the king .</s>

<s>in the eyes of those who still cared for such things , it was a reflection on his honor , and it gave further grounds for complaint to his overtaxed subjects , who were already grumbling -- although probably not in Latin -- non est lex sana quod regi sit mea lana .</s>

<s>bad relations between England and Flanders brought hard times to the shepherds scattered over the dales and downs as well as to the crowded Flemish cities , and while the English , so far , had done no more than grumble , Othon had seen what the discontent might lead to , for before he left the Low Countries the citizens of Ghent had risen in protest against the expense of supporting Edward and his troops , and the regular soldiers had found it unexpectedly difficult to put down the nasty little riot that ensued .</s>

<s>in all the talk of feudal rights , the knights and bishops must never forget the woolworkers , nor was it easy to do so , for all along the road to Italy they passed the Florentine pack trains going home with their loads of raw wool from England and rough Flemish cloth , the former to be spun and woven by the Arte Della Lana and the latter to be refined and dyed by the Arte Della Calimala with the pigment recently discovered in Asia Minor by one of their members , Bernardo Rucellai , the secret of which they jealously kept for themselves .</s>

<s>these chatty merchants made amusing and instructive traveling companions , for their business took them to all four corners of the globe , and Florentine gossip had already reached a high stage of development as even a cursory glance at the Inferno will prove .</s>

<s>a northern ambassador , willing to keep his mouth shut and his ears open , could learn a lot that would stand him in good stead at the Curia .</s>

<s>they had other topics of conversation , besides their news from courts and fairs , which were of interest to Othon , the builder of castles in Wales and churches in his native country .</s>

<s>behind him lay the Low Countries , where men were still completing the cathedrals that a later Florentine would describe as a malediction of little tabernacles , one on top of the other , with so many pyramids and spires and leaves that it is a wonder they stand up at all , for they look as though they were made of paper instead of stone or marble ;
the Low Countries , where the Middle Ages were to last for another two centuries and die out only when Charles the Bold of Burgundy met his first defeat in the fields and forests below the walls of Grandson .</s>

<s>it usually turned out well for him because either he liked the right people or there were only a few wrong people in the town .</s>

<s>Alfred wanted to invest in my father's hotel and advance enough money to build a larger place .</s>

<s>it was a very tempting offer .</s>

<s>my father would have done it if it hadn't been for my mother , who had a fear of being in debt to anyone -- even Alfred Alpert .</s>

<s>in spite of his being well liked there were a few people who were very careful about Alfred .</s>

<s>they had my mother's opinion of him : that he was too sharp or a little too good to be true .</s>

<s>one of the people who was afraid of Alfred was his own brother , Lew .</s>

<s>I don't know how and I don't know why but the two stores , the one in Margaretville and the one in Fleischmanns that had been set up as a partnership , were dissolved , separated from each other .</s>

<s>everything was all very friendly , except when it came to Harry , the youngest brother .</s>

<s>Alfred , who was a good deal older than Harry , had treated him like a son , and when Harry decided to stay in business with Lew instead of going with Alfred , Alfred looked on the decision as a betrayal .</s>

<s>from that day on he never spoke to Harry or to Lew , or to Lew's two boys , Mort and Jimmy .</s>

<s>the six miles between the towns became an ocean and the Alperts became a family of strangers .</s>

<s>time went on and everybody got older .</s>

<s>I became fifteen , sixteen , then twenty , and still Tessie Alpert sat on the porch with a rose in her hair , and Alfred got richer and sicker with diabetes .</s>

<s>it was in the spring of the year when he took to his bed and Tessie and Alfred found out that they didn't know each other .</s>

<s>they were like two strangers .</s>

<s>the store was their marriage , and when Alfred had to leave it there was nothing to hold them together .</s>

<s>Tessie , everybody thought , was a strong woman , but she was only strong because she had Alfred to lean on .</s>

<s>and when Alfred was forced into his bed , Tessie left the front porch of the store and sat at home , rocking in her rocker in the living room , staring out the window -- the rose still in her hair .</s>

<s>Tessie could do nothing for Alfred .</s>

<s>she couldn't cook or clean or make him comfortable .</s>

<s>instead she waited for Alfred to get better and take care of her .</s>

<s>spring was life -- and Alfred Alpert in his sickroom was death .</s>

<s>Alfred knew that , too .</s>

<s>I remember him pointing out of the window and saying that he wished he could live to see another spring but that he wouldn't .</s>

<s>Alfred began to put his affairs in order , and he went about it like a man putting his things into storage .</s>

<s>my father , who liked Alfred very much , was a constant visitor .</s>

<s>one day Alfred told him that he had decided to leave everything to me .</s>

<s>my father , a wise man , asked him not to .</s>

<s>he knew Alfred liked me ;
if he wanted to leave me something let it be a trinket , nothing else .</s>

<s>by leaving me everything he wouldn't be doing me a favor , my father told him , and he didn't want to see his daughter involved in a lawsuit .</s>

<s>he didn't want Alfred to leave me trouble because that's all it would be , and Alfred understood .</s>

<s>Alfred was getting too sick to stay in his own home .</s>

<s>the doctor wanted him in a hospital ;
the nearest one was forty miles away in Kingston .</s>

<s>the day Alfred left his home and Fleischmanns he gave up the convictions of a lifetime .</s>

<s>he sent me for Meltzer the Butcher , whom he wanted not as a friend but as a rabbi .</s>

<s>Meltzer knew why I had come for him .</s>

<s>solemnly he walked me back to Alfred's house without a word passing between us .</s>

<s>he entered the house in silence , walked into Alfred's room , and closed the door behind him .</s>

<s>I sat down to wait , and I watched Tessie Alpert , who hadn't moved or said a word but kept staring out of the window .</s>

<s>for a few minutes there was nothing to hear .</s>

<s>then Meltzer's voice , quiet , calm , strong , started the Kaddish , the prayer for the dead .</s>

<s>I could hear Alfred's voice a few words behind Meltzer's like a counterpoint , punctuated by sobs of sorrow and resignation .</s>

<s>there was a finality in the rhythm of the prayer -- it was the end of a life , the end of hope , and the wondering if there would ever be another beginning .</s>

<s>Meltzer stayed with Alfred , and when the door opened they both came out .</s>

<s>Alfred was dressed for his trip to the hospital .</s>

<s>the car was waiting for him .</s>

<s>Alfred , leaning on Meltzer , stopped for a minute to look at Tessie .</s>

<s>she didn't turn away from the window .</s>

<s>Alfred nodded a little nod and went out through the door .</s>

<s>outside , his brother Harry was waiting for him -- he had come to say good-bye .</s>

<s>Alfred walked past him without a word and got into the car .</s>

<s>Harry ran to the side of the car where Alfred was sitting and looked at him , begging him to speak .</s>

<s>Alfred looked straight ahead .</s>

<s>the car began to move and Harry ran after it crying , Alfred ]
Alfred ]
speak to me .</s>

<s>but the car moved off and Alfred just looked straight ahead .</s>

<s>Harry followed the car until it reached the main road and turned towards Kingston .</s>

<s>he stood there watching until it had gone from his sight .</s>

<s>I went to visit Alfred in the Kingston Hospital a few times .</s>

<s>the first time I went there he asked me to bring him water from Flagler's well -- water that reminded him of his first days in the mountains -- and before I came the next time I filled a five-gallon jug for him and brought it to the hospital .</s>

<s>I don't think he ever got to drink any of it .</s>

<s>the jug stayed at the hospital and the water -- what can happen to water ?</s>

<s>-- it evaporated , disappeared , and came back to the earth as rain -- maybe for another well or another stream or another Alfred Alpert .</s>

<s>12 where is it written ?</s>

<s>Mr. Banks was always called Banks the Butcher until he left town and the shop passed over to Meltzer the Scholar who then became automatically Meltzer the Butcher .</s>

<s>Meltzer was a boarder with the Banks family .</s>

<s>he came to Fleischmanns directly from the boat that brought him to America from Russia .</s>

<s>he was a learned man and a very gentle soul .</s>

<s>he was filled with knowledge of the Bible and the Talmud .</s>

<s>he knew the whyfores and the wherefores but he was weak , very weak , on the therefores .</s>

<s>Banks the Butcher took Meltzer the Scholar as an apprentice and he made it very clear that a man of learning must be able to do more than just quote the Commentaries of the Talmud in order to live .</s>

<s>so Meltzer learned a new trade from Banks , who supplied the town and the hotels with meat .</s>

<s>Banks had a family -- a wife , a daughter , and a son .</s>

<s>the daughter , Lilly , was a very good friend of mine and I always had hopes that someday she and Meltzer would find each other .</s>

<s>they lived in the same house and it didn't seem to be such a hard thing to do , but the sad realities of Lilly's life and the fact that Meltzer didn't love her never satisfied my wishful thinking .</s>

<s>Banks the Butcher was a hard master and a hard father , a man who didn't seem to know the difference between the living flesh of his family and the hanging carcasses of his stock in trade .</s>

<s>he treated both with equal indifference and with equal contempt ;
perhaps he was a little more sympathetic to the sides of beef that hung silently from his hooks .</s>

<s>Lilly Banks and I became friends .</s>

<s>she was the opposite of everything she should have been -- a positive pole in a negative home , a living reaction of warmth and kindness to the harsh reality of her father .</s>

<s>and Lilly's whole family seemed to be an apology for Mr. Banks .</s>

<s>her brother Karl was a very gentle soul , her mother was a quiet woman who said little but who had hard , probing eyes .</s>

<s>for every rude word of Mr. Banks's the family had five in apology .</s>

<s>every chance I got I left the hotel to visit Lilly .</s>

<s>I was free but she was bound to her duties that not even the coming of Meltzer lightened .</s>

<s>she had to clean the glass on the display cases in the butcher shop , help her brother scrub the cutting tables with wire brushes , mop the floors , put down new sawdust on the floors and help check the outgoing orders .</s>

<s>when these chores were finished , only then , was she allowed whatever freedom she could find .</s>

<s>I helped Lilly in the store .</s>

<s>to me it was a game , to her it was the deadly seriousness of life .</s>

<s>I wanted to help so that we could find time to play .</s>

<s>and Lilly allowed me to help so that she could have her few little hours of escape .</s>

<s>when the work was finished , we would walk .</s>

<s>the road past the butcher shop took us along the side of a stream .</s>

<s>it ran north , away from the town and the people , through woods and past the nothingness of a graveyard .</s>

<s>Lilly preferred the loneliness of that walk .</s>

<s>I would have liked the town and the busyness of its people but I always followed Lilly into the peace of the silent and unstaring road .</s>

<s>it wasn't hard to understand .</s>

<s>to me Lilly was a fine and lovely girl .</s>

<s>to people who didn't know her she was a gawky , badly dressed kid whose arms were too long , whose legs were a little too bony .</s>

<s>she had the hips of a boy and a loose-jointed walk that reminded me of a string of beads strolling down the street .</s>

<s>and she had the kind of crossed eyes that shocked .</s>

<s>it was unexpected , unexpected because Lilly walked with her head bent down , down , and her mark of friendship was to look into your face .</s>

<s>I accepted her crossed eyes as she accepted my childishness ;
childishness compared to her grown-up understanding that life was a punishment for as yet undisclosed sins .</s>

<s>we were almost the same age , she was fifteen , I was twelve , and where I felt there was a life to look forward to Lilly felt she had had as much of it as was necessary .</s>

<s>when we went for our walks Lilly's brother would come along every once in a while .</s>

<s>Karl was an almost exact copy of his father physically and it was strange to see the expected become the unexpected .</s>

<s>this huge hulk played the guitar and he would take it along on our walks and play for us as we sat alone in the woods or by the stream .</s>

<s>Karl played well and his favorite song was a Schubert lullaby .</s>

<s>he spoke no German but he could sing it and the words of the song were the only ones he knew in a foreign language .</s>

<s>the song , he said , was called The Stream's Lullaby , and when he sang , gute ruh , gute ruh , mach't die augen zu , there was such longing and such simple sadness that it frightened me .</s>

<s>later , when I was older , I found the song was part of Schubert's Die Schone Mullerin .</s>

<s>and even hearing it in a concert hall surrounded by hundreds of people the words and the melody would make me a little colder and I would reach out for my husband's hand .</s>

<s>the brother and sister seemed to be a sort of mutual-aid society , a little fortress of kindness for each other in a hard world .</s>

<s>I felt very flattered to be included in the protection of their company even though I had nothing to be protected from .</s>

<s>the turn of the century , or to be more precise , the two decades preceeding and following it , marks a great change in the history of early English scholarship .</s>

<s>at the bottom of this change were great strides forward in the technical equipment and technical standards of the historian .</s>

<s>in archaeology , for example , the contributions of Frederick Haverfield and Reginald Smith to the various volumes of the Victoria County Histories raised the discipline from the status of an antiquarian pastime to that of the most valuable single tool of the early English historian .</s>

<s>and with the publication of E. T. Leeds' Archaeology Of The Anglo-Saxon Settlements the student was presented with an organized synthesis of the archaeological data then known .</s>

<s>what was true for archaeology was also true of place-name studies .</s>

<s>the value of place-names in the reconstruction of early English history had long been recognized .</s>

<s>place-names , in fact , had been extensively utilized for this purpose from the time of Camden onwards .</s>

<s>without a precise knowledge of Germanic philology , however , it is debatable whether their use was not more often a source of confusion and error than anything else .</s>

<s>even in the nineteenth century such accomplished philologists as Kemble and Guest were led into what now seem ludicrous errors because of their failure to recognize that modern forms of place names are not necessarily the result of logical philological development .</s>

<s>it was therefore not until the publication of J.H.</s>

<s>Round's The Settlement Of The South And East Saxons , and W.H.</s>

<s>Stevenson's Dr.</s>

<s>Guest And The English Conquest Of South Britain , that a scientific basis for place-name studies was established .</s>

<s>diplomatic is another area for which the dawn of the twentieth century marks the beginning of modern standards of scholarship .</s>

<s>although because of the important achievements of nineteenth century scholars in the field of textual criticism the advance is not so striking as it was in the case of archaeology and place-names , the editorial principles laid down by Stevenson in his great edition of Asser and in his Crawford Charters were a distinct improvement upon those of his predecessors and remain unimproved upon today .</s>

<s>in sum , it can be said that the techniques and standards of present day have their origin at the turn of the century .</s>

<s>and it is this , particularly the establishment of archaeology and place-name studies on a scientific basis , which are immediately pertinent to the Saxon Shore .</s>

<s>almost inevitably , the first result of this technological revolution was a reaction against the methods and in many cases the conclusions of the Oxford school of Stubbs , Freeman and ( particularly ) Green regarding the nature of the Anglo-Saxon conquest of Britain .</s>

<s>even before the century was out the tide of reaction had set in .</s>

<s>Charles Plummer in the introduction and notes to his splendid edition of Bede voiced some early doubts concerning the elaborate superstructure they raised up over the slim foundations afforded by the traditional narratives of the conquest .</s>

<s>it was Plummer , in fact , who coined the much quoted remark : Mr. Green indeed writes as if he had been present at the landing of the Saxons and had watched every step of their subsequent progress .</s>

<s>Sir Henry Howorth , writing in 1898 , put himself firmly in the Lappenburg-Kemble tradition by attacking the veracity of the West Saxon annals .</s>

<s>early in the present century , W. H. Stevenson continued the attack with a savage article against Guest .</s>

<s>following him in varying degrees of scepticism were T.W.</s>

<s>Shore , H.M. Chadwick , Thomas Hodgkin and F. G. Beck .</s>

<s>by 1913 , Ferdinand Lot could begin an article subtitled La Conquete De La Grande-Bretagne par Les Saxons with the words , il est difficile aujourd'hui d'entretenir des illusions sur la valeur du recit traditionnel de la conquete de la Grande-Bretagne .</s>

<s>it is also worthy of note that Lot cited both Kemble and Lappenberg with favor in that article .</s>

<s>it would seem that the wheel had turned full circle .</s>

<s>in fact , modern scholarly opinion in the main has not retreated all the way back to the destructive scepticism of the first half of the nineteenth century .</s>

<s>although one meets with occasional extremists like Zachrisson or , very recently , Arthur Wade-Evans the majority of scholars have taken a middle position between the extremes of scepticism and gullibility .</s>

<s>most now admit that Bede , Gildas , Nennius and The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles cannot be the infallible guides to early English history that Guest , Freeman and Green thought them to be .</s>

<s>as R.H. Hodgkin has remarked : the critical methods of the nineteenth century shattered most of this picturesque narrative .</s>

<s>on the other hand , the consensus of opinion is that , used with caution and in conjunction with other types of evidence , the native sources still provide a valid rough outline for the English settlement of southern Britain .</s>

<s>as Sir Charles Oman once said , it is no longer fashionable to declare that we can say nothing certain about Old English origins .</s>

<s>therefore , in one way Kemble and Lappenberg have been vindicated .</s>

<s>their conclusions concerning the untrustworthiness of the West Saxon annals , the confused chronology of Bede , the unreliability of the early positions of the Anglo-Saxon genealogies and the mythological elements contained in Nennius are now mostly accepted .</s>

<s>nevertheless , in another way modern historians still labor in the vineyard of the Oxford school .</s>

<s>for it is their catastrophic concept of the Anglo-Saxon invasions rather than Kemble's gradualist approach which dominates the field .</s>

<s>despite the rejection of the traditional accounts on many points of detail , as late as 1948 it was still possible to postulate a massive and comparatively sudden ( beginning in ca.</s>

<s>450 ) influx of Germans as the type of invasions .</s>

<s>at this point , of course , the issue has become complicated by a development unforeseen by Lappenberg and Kemble .</s>

<s>they , however much they were in disagreement with the late Victorians over the method by which Britain was Germanized , agreed with them that the end result was the complete extinction of the previous Celtic population and civilization .</s>

<s>but beginning , for all practical purposes , with Frederick Seebohm's English Village Community scholars have had to reckon with a theory involving institutional and agrarian continuity between Roman and Anglo-Saxon times which is completely at odds with the reigning concept of the Anglo-Saxon invasions .</s>

<s>against Seebohm formidable foes have taken the field , notably F. W. Maitland , whose Domesday Book And Beyond was written expressly for this purpose , and Sir Paul Vinogradoff whose The Growth Of The Manor had a similar aim .</s>

<s>largely due to their efforts the catastrophic invasion-theory has maintained its position although Seebohm has always found supporters .</s>

<s>H.L.</s>

<s>Gray in his English Field Systems and Zachrisson's Romans , Kelts And Saxons defended in part the Seebohm thesis while at the present time H.P.R.</s>

<s>Finberg and Gordon Copley seem to fall into the Celtic survivalist camp .</s>

<s>this is nevertheless a minority view .</s>

<s>most scholars , while willing to accept a survival ( revival ?
)</s>

<s>of Celtic art forms and a considerable proportion of the Celtic population , reject any institutional legacy from pre-Anglo-Saxon Britain .</s>

<s>therefore , it is plain that the clear distinctions of the nineteenth century are no longer with us .</s>

<s>in the main stream of historical thinking is a group of scholars , H.M. Chadwick , R.H. Hodgkin , Sir Frank Stenton et al.</s>

<s>who are in varying degrees sceptical of the native traditions of the conquest but who defend the catastrophic type of invasion suggested by them .</s>

<s>they , in effect , have compromised the opposing positions of the nineteenth century .</s>

<s>on the other side are the Celtic survivalists who have taken a tack divergent from both these schools of nineteenth century thought .</s>

<s>as a group they should be favorable to a concept of gradual Germanic infiltration although the specialist nature of much of their work , e.g.</s>

<s>Seebohm , Gray and Finberg , tends to obscure their sympathies .</s>

<s>those who do have occasion to deal with the invasions in a more general way , like T.W.</s>

<s>Shore and Arthur Wade-Evans , are on the side of a gradual and often peaceful Germanic penetration into Britain .</s>

<s>Wade-Evans , in fact , denies that there were any Anglo-Saxon invasions at all other than a minor Jutish foray in A.D. 514 .</s>

<s>now omitting for a moment some recent developments we can say the Saxon Shore hypothesis of Lappenberg and Kemble has undergone virtual eclipse in this century .</s>

<s>it is no longer possible to say that a sceptical attitude towards the received accounts of the invasions almost automatically produces a shore occupied by interpretation .</s>

<s>everyone is more or less sceptical and virtually no one has been willing to accept Lappenberg or Kemble's position on that point .</s>

<s>one reason is , of course , that the new scepticism has been willing to maintain the general picture of the invasions as portrayed in the traditional sources .</s>

<s>the few scholars who have adopted the shore occupied by interpretation , Howorth , Shore , and Wade-Evans , have all been Celtic survivalists .</s>

<s>moreover , they have done so in rather special circumstances .</s>

<s>the primary reason for the abandonment of the shore occupied by thesis has been the assimilation and accumulation of archaeological evidence , the most striking feature of early English studies in this century .</s>

<s>again omitting recent developments , E.T.</s>

<s>Leeds' dictum of 1913 has stood unchallenged : so far as archaeology is concerned , there is not the least warrant for the second ( shore occupied by ) of these theories .</s>

<s>even earlier Haverfield had come to the same conclusion .</s>

<s>what they meant was that there was no evidence to show that the south and east coasts of Britain received Germanic settlers conspicuously earlier than some other parts of England .</s>

<s>that is , there was no trace of Anglo-Saxons in Britain as early as the late third century , to which time the archaeological evidence for the erection of the Saxon Shore forts was beginning to point .</s>

<s>in the face of a clear judgment from archaeology , therefore , it became impossible for a time for scholars to re-adopt the shore settled by theory .</s>

<s>in recent years , however , a wind of change seems to be blowing through early English historical circles .</s>

<s>the great increase in the amount of archaeological activity , and therefore information , in the years immediately preceeding and following the Second World War has brought to light data which has changed the complection of the Saxon Shore dispute .</s>

<s>where there were none fifteen years ago , several scholars currently are edging their way cautiously towards the acceptance of the shore occupied by position .</s>

<s>we must , therefore , have a look at the new archaeological material and re-examine the literary and place-name evidence which bears upon the problem .</s>

<s>what exactly are we trying to prove ?</s>

<s>we know that the Saxon Shore was a phenonenon of late Roman defensive policy ;
in other words its existence belongs to the period of Roman Britain .</s>

<s>so whenever the Romans finally withdrew from the island , the Saxon Shore disappeared in the first decade of the fifth century .</s>

<s>we also know that the Saxon Shore as reflected in the Notitia was created as a part of the Theodosian reorganization of Britain ( post A.D. 369 ) .</s>

<s>my argument is that there was no Saxon Shore prior to that time even though the forts had been in existence since the time of Carausius .</s>

<s>therefore , what we must prove or disprove is that there were Saxons , in the broad sense in which we must construe the word , in the area of the Saxon Shore at the time it was called the Saxon Shore .</s>

<s>that is , we must find Saxons in East Anglia , Kent , Sussex and Hampshire in the last half of the fourth century .</s>

<s>the problem , in other words , is strictly a chronological one .</s>

<s>in Gaul the Saxon element on its Saxon Shore was plainly visible because there the Saxons were an intrusive element in the population .</s>

<s>in Britain , obviously , the archaeological and place-name characteristics of the Saxon Shore region are bound to be Saxon .</s>

<s>it is a matter of trying to sort out an earlier fourth-century Saxon element from the later , fifth-century mainstream of Anglo-Saxon invasions .</s>

<s>this , naturally , will be difficult to do since both the archaeological and place-name evidence in this period , with some fortunate exceptions , is insufficient for precise chronological purposes .</s>

<s>it might be well to consider the literary evidence first because it can provide us with an answer to one important question ;
namely , is the idea that there were Saxon mercenaries in England at all reasonable ?</s>

<s>to do so , something was necessary beyond volunteering because there was little glamour or romance in the European war ;
it meant instead hardship , dirt , and death .</s>

<s>Baker gave Leonard Wood credit for the initiation of the draft of soldiers ;
from the General's idea a chain reaction occurred .</s>

<s>Wood took the proposal to Chief of Staff Hugh L. Scott , who passed it on to Baker a month before the actual declaration of war against Germany .</s>

<s>the Secretary of War gave his assent after studying the history of the draft in the American Civil War as well as the British volunteer system in World War 1 .</s>

<s>he concluded that selective service would not only prevent the disorganization of essential war industries but would avoid the undesirable moral effects of the British reliance on enlistment only -- where the feeling of the people was whipped into a frenzy by girls pinning white feathers on reluctant young men , orators preaching hate of the Germans , and newspapers exaggerating enemy outrages to make men enlist out of motives of revenge and retaliation .</s>

<s>Baker took the plan to Wilson who said : Baker , this is plainly right on any ground .</s>

<s>start to prepare the necessary legislation so that if I am obliged to go to Congress the bills will be ready for immediate consideration .</s>

<s>the result was that by secret agreement draft machinery was actually ready long before the country knew that the device was to take the place of the volunteering method which Theodore Roosevelt favored .</s>

<s>before the Draft Act was passed Baker had confidentially briefed governors , sheriffs , and prospective draft board members on the administration of the measure -- and the confidence was kept so well that only one newspaper learned what was going on .</s>

<s>it was Baker , working through Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder and Major Hugh S. ( Old Ironpants ) Johnson , who arranged for a secret printing by the million of selective service blanks -- again before the Act was passed -- until corridors in the Government Printing Office were full and the basement of the Washington Post Office was stacked to the ceiling .</s>

<s>General Crowder proposed that Regular Army officers select the draftees in cities and towns throughout the nation ;
it was Baker who thought of lessening the shock , which conscription always brings to a country , by substituting greetings from your neighbors for the recruiting sergeant , and registration in familiar voting places rather than at military installations .</s>

<s>even so , the Draft Act encountered rough sledding in its progress through the Congress .</s>

<s>Democratic Speaker Champ Clark saw little difference between a conscript and a convict .</s>

<s>Democrat Stanley H. Dent , Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee , declined to introduce the bill .</s>

<s>Democratic Floor Leader Claude Kitchin would have no part of the measure .</s>

<s>in the judgment of Chief of Staff Scott it was ironic that the draft policy of a Democratic President , aimed at Germany , had to be pushed through the House of Representatives by the ranking minority member of the Military Affairs Committee -- a Republican Jew born in Germany ]
he was Julius Kahn for whom the Chief of Staff thought no honor could be too great .</s>

<s>after Kahn's death in 1924 Scott wrote : may he rest in peace with the eternal gratitude of his adopted country .</s>

<s>in spite of powerful opposition the Draft Act finally passed Congress on May 17 , 1917 .</s>

<s>in early June ten million young men registered by name and number .</s>

<s>the day passed without incident in spite of the warning of Senator James A. Reed of Missouri : Baker , you will have the streets of our American cities running with blood on registration day .</s>

<s>on July 20 , the first drawing of numbers occurred in the Senate Office Building before a distinguished group of congressmen and high Army officers .</s>

<s>Secretary of War Baker , blindfolded , put his hand into a large glass bowl and drew the initial number of those to be called .</s>

<s>it was 258 .</s>

<s>a man in Mississippi wired : thanks for drawing 258 -- that's me .</s>

<s>he was the first of 2,800,000 called to the Army through the selective service system .</s>

<s>it was one thing to call men to the colors ;
it was another to house , feed , and train them .</s>

<s>the existing Army posts were wholly inadequate .</s>

<s>in a matter of months the War Department built thirty-two camps , each one accommodating fifty thousand men -- sixteen were under canvas in the South and sixteen with frame structures in the North .</s>

<s>it was a gargantuan task ;
a typical cantonment in the North had twelve hundred buildings , an electric-sewer-water system , and twenty-five miles of roads .</s>

<s>at Camp Taylor in Kentucky a barracks was built in an hour and a half from timber that had been standing in Mississippi forests one week before .</s>

<s>the total operation was a construction project comparable in magnitude with the Panama Canal , but in 1917 time was in short supply ;
in three months the Army spent three-quarters as much as had been expended on the big Ditch in ten years .</s>

<s>in later years Josephus Daniels was to claim that World War 1 was the first in American history in which there was great concern for both the health and morals of our soldiers .</s>

<s>it was the first American war in which the death rate from disease was lower than that from battle , due to the provision of trained medical personnel ( of the 200,000 officers , 42,000 were physicians ) , compulsory vaccination , rigorous camp sanitation , and adequate hospital facilities .</s>

<s>to the middle of September 1918 , there had been fewer than 10,000 deaths from disease in the new army .</s>

<s>this enviable record would have been maintained but for a great and unexpected disaster which struck the world with murderous stealth .</s>

<s>it was the influenza pandemic of 1918-19 .</s>

<s>the malady was popularly known as the Spanish flu from the alleged locale of its origin .</s>

<s>the world-wide total of deaths from Spanish flu was around twenty million ;
in the United States 300,000 succumbed to it .</s>

<s>in mid-September 1918 , the influenza-pneumonia pandemic swept through every American military camp ;
during the eight-week blitz attack 25,000 soldiers died from the disease and the death rate ( formerly 5 per year per 1,000 men ) increased almost fifty times to 4 per week per 1,000 men .</s>

<s>in spite of this catastrophe the final mortality figure from disease in the American Army during World War 1 was 15 per 1,000 per year , contrasted with 110 per 1,000 per year in the Mexican War , and 65 in the American Civil War .</s>

<s>both Secretary of War Baker and Secretary of Navy Daniels devoted much time and effort to the problem of providing reasonably normal and wholesome activities in camp for the millions of men who had been removed from their home environment .</s>

<s>their policy ran counter to the traditional idea that a good fighter was usually a libertine , and that in sex affairs God-given passion was a proof of manliness .</s>

<s>Baker moved first ;
six days after war was declared he appointed Raymond Fosdick chairman of the Commission on Training Camp Activities ( the J ) .</s>

<s>Fosdick , a brother of minister Harry Emerson Fosdick , was a graduate of Princeton , and a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the American Philosophical Association .</s>

<s>his assignment was not a new one because Baker had sent him to the Mexican border in 1916 to investigate lurid newspaper stories about lack of discipline , drunkenness , and venereal disease in American military camps .</s>

<s>Fosdick had found the installations surrounded by a battery of saloons and houses of prostitution , with filles de joie from all over the country flocking to San Antonio , Laredo , and El Paso to woman the cribs .</s>

<s>he also ascertained that many officers were indifferent to the problem , including Commanding General Frederick Funston who gave Fosdick the nickname of Reverend .</s>

<s>on the basis of the long chronicle of military history Funston and his brethren assumed that the issue was insoluble and that anyone interested in a mission like Fosdick's was an impractical idealist or a do-gooder .</s>

<s>during the brief Mexican venture Fosdick's report to the Secretary recommended a definite stand by the War Department against the saloon and the excesses of prostitution .</s>

<s>the problem involved military necessity as much as morality , for in pre-penicillin days venereal disease was a crippling disability .</s>

<s>Fosdick insisted that a strong word was needed from Washington , and it was immediately forthcoming .</s>

<s>Baker put the cribs and the saloons out of bounds , ordered the co-operation of military officers with local law authorities , and told communities that the troops would be moved unless wholesome conditions were restored .</s>

<s>both Baker and Fosdick knew that a substitute was necessary , that a verboten approach was not the real answer .</s>

<s>they were aware that soldiers went to town , in more ways than one , because of the monotony of camp life , to find the only release available in the absence of movies , reading rooms , and playing fields with adequate athletic equipment .</s>

<s>both knew that when trains stopped at Texan crossroads bored soldiers would sometimes enter to ask the passengers if they had any reading material to spare , even a newspaper .</s>

<s>there was no time in the short Mexican encounter to evolve a solution but the area provided a proving ground for new departures in the near future .</s>

<s>when the United States entered the First World War Baker made certain that the Draft Act of 1917 prohibited the sale of liquor to men in uniform and that it provided for broad zones around the camps in which prostitution was outlawed .</s>

<s>even so Fosdick , as the new Chairman of the Commission on Training Camp Activities , encountered strong and vociferous opposition .</s>

<s>New Orleans had a notorious red-light district extending over twenty-eight city blocks , and the business-minded mayor of the city journeyed to Washington to present the case for the God-given right of men to be men .</s>

<s>in Europe , Premier Clemenceau , showing his animal proclivities as the Tiger of France , asked Pershing by letter for the creation of special houses where the sexual desires of American men could be satisfied .</s>

<s>when Fosdick showed the letter to Baker his negative response was : for God's sake , Raymond , don't show this to the President or he'll stop the war .</s>

<s>ultimately Fosdick's Fit to fight slogan swept across the country and every well-known red-light district in the United States was closed , a hundred and ten of them .</s>

<s>the result was that the rate of venereal disease in the American Army was the lowest in our military history .</s>

<s>this was the negative side of the situation .</s>

<s>affirmatively Baker worked on the premise that young men spontaneously prefer to be decent , and that opportunities for wholesome recreation are the best possible cure for irregularities in conduct which arise from idleness and the baser temptations .</s>

<s>the wholesome activities were to be provided by many organizations including the J , the Knights of Columbus , the Jewish Welfare Board , the American Library Association , and the Playground and Recreation Association -- private societies which voluntarily performed the job that was taken over almost entirely by the Special Services Division of the Army itself in World War 2 .</s>

<s>over these voluntary agencies , in 1917-18 , the J served as a co-ordinating body in carrying out what Survey called the most stupendous piece of social work in modern times .</s>

<s>under Fosdick the first executive officer of the J was Richard Byrd , whose name in later years was to become synonymous with activities at the polar antipodes .</s>

<s>from the point of view of popularity the best-known member of the Commission was Walter Camp , the Yale athlete whose sobriquet was the father of American football .</s>

<s>he was placed in charge of athletics , and among other things adapted the type of calisthenics known as the daily dozen .</s>

<s>the J program of activities was profuse : William Farnum and Mary Pickford on the screen , Elsie Janis and Harry Lauder on the stage , books provided by the American Library Association , full equipment for games and sports -- except that no bones were furnished for the all-time favorite pastime played on any floor and known as African golf .</s>

<s>the J distributed a khaki-bound songbook that provided the impetus for spirited renditions of the selections found therein , plus a number of others whose lyrics were more earthy -- from Johnny Get Your Gun to Keep The Home Fires Burning to Mademoiselle From Armentieres .</s>

<s>in the imagination of the nineteenth century the Greek tragedians and Shakespeare stand side by side , their affinity transcending all the immense contrarieties of historical circumstance , religious belief , and poetic form .</s>

<s>we no longer use the particular terms of Lessing and Victor Hugo .</s>

<s>but we abide by their insight .</s>

<s>the word tragedy encloses for us in a single span both the Greek and the Elizabethan example .</s>

<s>the sense of relationship overreaches the historical truth that Shakespeare may have known next to nothing of the actual works of Aeschylus , Sophocles , and Euripides .</s>

<s>it transcends the glaring fact that the Elizabethans mixed tragedy and comedy whereas the Greeks kept the two modes severely distinct .</s>

<s>it overcomes our emphatic awareness of the vast difference in the shape and fabric of the two languages and styles of dramatic presentation .</s>

<s>the intimations of a related spirit and ordering of human values are stronger than any sense of disparity .</s>

<s>comparable visions of life are at work in Antigone and Romeo And Juliet .</s>

<s>we see at once what Victor Hugo means when he calls Macbeth a northern scion of the house of Atreus .</s>

<s>Elsinore seems to lie in a range of Mycenae , and the fate of Orestes resounds in that of Hamlet .</s>

<s>the hounds of hell search out their quarry in Apollo's sanctuary as they do in the tent of Richard 3 .</s>

<s>Oedipus and Lear attain similar insights by virtue of similar blindness .</s>

<s>it is not between Euripides and Shakespeare that the western mind turns away from the ancient tragic sense of life .</s>

<s>it is after the late seventeenth century .</s>

<s>I say the late seventeenth century because Racine ( whom Lessing did not really know ) stands on the far side of the chasm .</s>

<s>the image of man which enters into force with Aeschylus is still vital in Phedre and Athalie .</s>

<s>it is the triumph of rationalism and secular metaphysics which marks the point of no return .</s>

<s>Shakespeare is closer to Sophocles than he is to Pope and Voltaire .</s>

<s>to say this is to set aside the realness of time .</s>

<s>but it is true , nevertheless .</s>

<s>the modes of the imagination implicit in Athenian tragedy continued to shape the life of the mind until the age of Descartes and Newton .</s>

<s>it is only then that the ancient habits of feeling and the classic orderings of material and psychological experience were abandoned .</s>

<s>with the Discours de la methode and the Principia the things undreamt of in Horatio's philosophy seem to pass from the world .</s>

<s>in Greek tragedy as in Shakespeare , mortal actions are encompassed by forces which transcend man .</s>

<s>the reality of Orestes entails that of the Furies ;
the Weird Sisters wait for the soul of Macbeth .</s>

<s>we cannot conceive of Oedipus without a Sphinx , nor of Hamlet without a Ghost .</s>

<s>the shadows cast by the personages of Greek and Shakespearean drama lengthen into a greater darkness .</s>

<s>and the entirety of the natural world is party to the action .</s>

<s>the thunderclaps over the sacred wood at Colonus and the storms in King Lear are caused by more than weather .</s>

<s>in tragedy , lightning is a messenger .</s>

<s>but it can no longer be so once Benjamin Franklin ( the incarnation of the new rational man ) has flown a kite to it .</s>

<s>the tragic stage is a platform extending precariously between heaven and hell .</s>

<s>those who walk on it may encounter at any turn ministers of grace or damnation .</s>

<s>Oedipus and Lear instruct us how little of the world belongs to man .</s>

<s>mortality is the pacing of a brief and dangerous watch , and to all sentinels , whether at Elsinore or on the battlements at Mycenae , the coming of dawn has its breath of miracle .</s>

<s>it banishes the night wanderers to fire or repose .</s>

<s>but at the touch of Hume and Voltaire the noble or hideous visitations which had haunted the mind since Agamemnon's blood cried out for vengeance , disappeared altogether or took tawdry refuge among the gaslights of melodrama .</s>

<s>modern roosters have lost the art of crowing restless spirits back to Purgatory .</s>

<s>in Athens , in Shakespeare's England , and at Versailles , the hierarchies of worldly power were stable and manifest .</s>

<s>the wheel of social life spun around the royal or aristocratic centre .</s>

<s>from it , spokes of order and degree led to the outward rim of the common man .</s>

<s>tragedy presumes such a configuration .</s>

<s>its sphere is that of royal courts , dynastic quarrels , and vaulting ambitions .</s>

<s>the same metaphors of swift ascent and calamitous decline apply to Oedipus and Macbeth because they applied also to Alcibiades and Essex .</s>

<s>and the fate of such men has tragic relevance because it is public .</s>

<s>Agamemnon , Creon , and Medea perform their tragic actions before the eyes of the polis .</s>

<s>similarly the sufferings of Hamlet , Othello , or Phedre engage the fortunes of the state .</s>

<s>they are enacted at the heart of the body politic .</s>

<s>hence the natural setting of tragedy is the palace gate , the public square , or the court chamber .</s>

<s>Greek and Elizabethan life and , to a certain extent , the life of Versailles shared this character of intense publicity .</s>

<s>princes and factions clashed in the open street and died on the open scaffold .</s>

<s>with the rise to power of the middle class the centre of gravity in human affairs shifted from the public to the private .</s>

<s>the art of Defoe and Richardson is founded on an awareness of this great change .</s>

<s>heretofore an action had possessed the breadth of tragedy only if it involved high personages and if it occurred in the public view .</s>

<s>behind the tragic hero stands the chorus , the crowd , or the observant courtier .</s>

<s>in the eighteenth century there emerges for the first time the notion of a private tragedy ( or nearly for the first time , there having been a small number of Elizabethan domestic tragedies such as the famous Arden Of Feversham ) .</s>

<s>in La Nouvelle-Heloise and Werther tragedy is made intimate .</s>

<s>and private tragedy became the chosen ground not of drama , but of the new , unfolding art of the novel .</s>

<s>the novel was not only the presenter of the new , secular , rationalistic , private world of the middle class .</s>

<s>it served also as a literary form exactly appropriate to the fragmented audience of modern urban culture .</s>

<s>I have said before how difficult it is to make any precise statements with regard to the character of the Greek and Elizabethan public .</s>

<s>but one major fact seems undeniable .</s>

<s>until the advent of rational empiricism the controlling habits of the western mind were symbolic and allegoric .</s>

<s>available evidence regarding the natural world , the course of history , and the varieties of human action were translated into imaginative designs or mythologies .</s>

<s>classic mythology and Christianity are such architectures of the imagination .</s>

<s>they order the manifold levels of reality and moral value along an axis of being which extends from brute matter to the immaculate stars .</s>

<s>there had not yet supervened between understanding and expression the new languages of mathematics and scientific formulas .</s>

<s>the poet was by definition a realist , his imaginings and parables being natural organizations of reality .</s>

<s>and in these organizations certain primal notions played a radiant part , radiant both in the sense of giving light and of being a pole toward which all perspectives converge .</s>

<s>I mean such concepts as the presence of the supernatural in human affairs , the sacraments of grace and divine retribution , the idea of preordainment ( the oracle over Oedipus , the prophecy of the witches to Macbeth , or God's covenant with His people in Athalie ) .</s>

<s>I refer to the notion that the structure of society is a microcosm of the cosmic design and that history conforms to patterns of justice and chastisement as if it were a morality play set in motion by the gods for our instruction .</s>

<s>these conceptions and the manner in which they were transposed into poetry or engendered by poetic form are intrinsic to western life from the time of Aeschylus to that of Shakespeare .</s>

<s>and although they were , as I have indicated , under increasing strain at the time of Racine , they are still alive in his theatre .</s>

<s>they are the essential force behind the conventions of tragedy .</s>

<s>they are as decisively present in the Oresteia and Oedipus as in Macbeth , King Lear , and Phedre .</s>

<s>after the seventeenth century the audience ceased to be an organic community to which these ideas and their attendant habits of figurative language would be natural or immediately familiar .</s>

<s>concepts such as grace , damnation , purgation , blasphemy , or the chain of being , which are everywhere implicit in classic and Shakespearean tragedy , lose their vitality .</s>

<s>they become philosophic abstractions of a private and problematic relevance , or mere catchwords in religious customs which had in them a diminishing part of active belief .</s>

<s>after Shakespeare the master spirits of western consciousness are no longer the blind seers , the poets , or Orpheus performing his art in the face of hell .</s>

<s>they are Descartes , Newton , and Voltaire .</s>

<s>and their chroniclers are not the dramatic poets but the prose novelists .</s>

<s>the romantics were the immediate inheritors of this tremendous change .</s>

<s>they were not yet prepared to accept it as irremediable .</s>

<s>Rousseau's primitivism , the anti-Newtonian mythology of Blake , Coleridge's organic metaphysics , Victor Hugo's image of the poets as the Magi , and Shelley's unacknowledged legislators are related elements in the rear-guard action fought by the romantics against the new scientific rationalism .</s>

<s>from this action sprang the idea of somehow uniting Greek and Shakespearean drama into a new total form , capable of restoring to life the ancient moral and poetic responses .</s>

<s>the dream of achieving a synthesis between the Sophoclean and the Shakespearean genius inspired the ambitions of poets and composers from the time of Shelley and Victor Hugo to that of Bayreuth .</s>

<s>it could not really be fulfilled .</s>

<s>the conventions into which the romantics tried to breath life no longer corresponded to the realities of thought and feeling .</s>

<s>but the attempt itself produced a number of brilliant works , and these form a transition from the early romantic period to the new age of Ibsen and Chekhov .</s>

<s>the wedding of the Hellenic to the northern genius was one of the dominant motifs in Goethe's thought .</s>

<s>his Italian journey was a poet's version of those perennial thrusts across the Alps of the German emperors of the Middle Ages .</s>

<s>the dream of a descent into the gardens of the south always drew German ambitions toward Rome and Sicily .</s>

<s>Goethe asks in Wilhelm Meister whether we know the land where the lemon trees flower , and the light of the Mediterranean glows through Torquato Tasso and the Roman Elegies .</s>

<s>Goethe believed that the Germanic spirit , with its grave strength but flagrant streaks of brutality and intolerance , should be tempered with the old sensuous wisdom and humanism of the Hellenic .</s>

<s>on the narrower ground of poetic form , he felt that in the drama of the future the Greek conception of tragic fate should be joined to the Shakespearean vision of tragic will .</s>

<s>the wager between God and Satan brings on the destiny of Faust , but Faust assumes his role voluntarily .</s>

<s>the third Act of Faust 2 is a formal celebration of the union between the Germanic and the classic , between the spirit of Euripides and that of romantic drama .</s>

<s>the motif of Faust's love for Helen of Troy goes back to the sources of the Faustian legend .</s>

<s>it tells us of the ancient human desire to see the highest wisdom joined to the highest sensual beauty .</s>

<s>there can be no greater magic than to wrest from death her in whom the flesh was all , in whom beauty was entirely pure because it was entirely corruptible .</s>

<s>it is thus that the brightness of Helen passes through Marlowe's Faustus .</s>

<s>Goethe used the fable to more elaborate ends .</s>

<s>Faust rescuing Helen from Menelaus' vengeance is the genius of renaissance Europe restoring to life the classic tradition .</s>

<s>the necromantic change from the palace at Sparta to Faust's Gothic castle directs us to the aesthetic meaning of the myth -- the translation of antique drama into Shakespearean and romantic guise .</s>

<s>this translation , or rather the fusion of the two ideals , creates the Gesamtkunstwerke , the total art form .</s>

<s>the Bishop of Gloucester described the elder Thomas in 1577 as the richest recusant in his diocese , worth five hundred pounds a year in lands and goods .</s>

<s>when Quiney and William Parsons wrote to Greville in 1593 asking his consent in the election for bailiff , they sent the letter to Mr. William Sawnders , attendant on the worshipful Mr. Thomas Bushell at Marston .</s>

<s>Mr. Bushell was mentioned in 1602 in the will of Joyce Hobday , widow of a Stratford glover .</s>

<s>Thomas the elder married twice , had seventeen children , and died in 1615 .</s>

<s>his daughter Elinor married Quiney's son Adrian in 1613 , and his son Henry married Mary Lane of Stratford in 1609 .</s>

<s>his son Thomas , aged fifteen when he entered Oxford in 1582 , married as his first wife Margaret , sister of Sir Edward Greville .</s>

<s>Bridges , a son by his second wife , was christened at Pebworth in 1607 , but Thomas the younger was living at Packwood two years later and sold Broad Marston manor in 1622 .</s>

<s>Edward Greville , born about 1565 , had inherited Milcote on the execution of his father Lodowick for murder in 1589 .</s>

<s>at Milcote on November 3 , 1597 , the aldermen asked him to support their petition for a new charter .</s>

<s>Sturley wrote to Quiney that Sir Edward gave his allowance and liking thereof , and affied unto us his best endeavour , so that his rights be preserved , and that Sir Edward saith we shall not be at any fault for money for prosecuting the cause , for himself will procure it and lay it down for us for the time .</s>

<s>Greville proposed Quiney as the fittest man for the following of the cause and to attend him in the matter , and at his suggestion the corporation allowed Quiney two shillings a day .</s>

<s>if you can firmly make the good knight sure to pleasure our Corporation , Sturley wrote , besides that ordinary allowance for your diet you shall have 20 for recompence .</s>

<s>in his letter mentioning Shakespeare on January 24 , 1597/8 , Sturley asked Quiney especially that theare might ( be ) bi Sir Ed.</s>

<s>the corporation voted on September 27 , 1598 , that Quiney should ride to London about the suit to Sir John Fortescue , chancellor of the Exchequer , for discharging of the tax and subsidy .</s>

<s>he had been in London for several weeks when he wrote to Shakespeare on October 25 .</s>

<s>Sturley on November 4 answered a letter from Quiney written on October 25 which imported , wrote Sturley , that our countriman Mr. Wm.</s>

<s>Sturley quoted Quiney as having written on November 1 that if he had more monei presente much might be done to obtaine our Charter enlargd , with tole of corne , bestes , and sheepe , and a matter of more valewe then all that .</s>

<s>Sturley thought that this matter might be the rest of the tithes and the College houses and landes in our towne .</s>

<s>he suggested offering half to Sir Edward , fearing lest he shall thinke it to good for us and procure it for himselfe , as he served us the last time .</s>

<s>this refers to what had happened after the Earl of Warwick died in 1590 , when the town petitioned Burghley for the right to name the vicar and schoolmaster and other privileges but Greville bought the lordship for himself .</s>

<s>Sturley's allusion probably explains why Greville took out the patent in the names of Best and Wells , for Sir Anthony Ashley described Best as a scrivener within Temple Bar , that deals in many matters for my L. Essex through Sir Gelly Merrick , especially in causes that he would not be known of .</s>

<s>Adrian Quiney wrote to his son Richard on October 29 and again perhaps the next day , since the bearer of the letter , the bailiff , was expected to reach London on November 1 .</s>

<s>Daniel Baker deluged his Unckle Quyne with requests to pay money for him to drapers in Watling Street and at the Two Cats in Canning Street .</s>

<s>he also sued them for taking toll of grain at their market .</s>

<s>accompanied by Master Greene our solicitor ( Thomas Greene of the Middle Temple , Shakespeare's cousin ) , Quiney tried to consult Sir Edward Coke , attorney general , and gave money to a clerk and a doorkeeper that we might have access to their master for his counsel butt colde nott have him att leasure by the reason of thees trobles ( the Essex rising on February 8 ) .</s>

<s>he set down that I gave Mr. Greene a pynte of muskadell and a roll of bread that last morning I went to have his company to Master Attorney .</s>

<s>after returning Stratford he drew up a defense of the town's right to toll corn and the office of collecting it , and his list of suggested witnesses included his father and Shakespeare's father .</s>

<s>his credulity is perhaps best illustrated in his introduction to The Emancipation Of Massachusetts , which purports to examine the trials of Moses and to draw a parallel between the leader of the Israelite exodus from Egypt and the leadership of the Puritan clergy in colonial New England .</s>

<s>much criticism has been leveled at this rather forced analogy , but what is equally significant is Adams' complete acceptance of the Biblical record as good and trustworthy history .</s>

<s>in light of the scholarly reappraisals engendered by the higher criticism this is a most remarkable statement , particularly coming from one who was well known for his antifundamentalist views .</s>

<s>the desire to substantiate a thesis at the expense of sound research technique smacks more of the propagandist than the historian .</s>

<s>a similar amateurish characteristic is revealed in Adams' failure to check the accuracy and authenticity of his informational sources .</s>

<s>if he found data that fitted his general plan , he used it and counted his sources trustworthy .</s>

<s>conversely , if statistics were uncovered which contradicted a cherished theory , the sources were denounced as faulty .</s>

<s>such manipulations are frequently encountered in his essay on the suppression of the monasteries during the English reformation .</s>

<s>Adams depended largely on the dispatches of foreign ambassadors and observers in England , claiming that the reports of such agents had to be accurate because there were no newspapers .</s>

<s>this is certainly an irrational dogmatism , in which the modern mind attempts to understand the spirit of the sixteenth century on twentieth-century terms .</s>

<s>moreover , he rejects the contemporary accounts of Englishmen , casually adjudging them to be distorted by prejudice because the opinions of Englishmen are of no great value .</s>

<s>what is exposited by this observation is not the inherent prejudices of Englishmen but the Anglophobia of Brooks Adams .</s>

<s>in all fairness it must be admitted that Adams made no pretense at being an impartial historian .</s>

<s>impartiality to him meant an unwillingness to generalize and to search for a synthesis .</s>

<s>he deplored the impact of German historiography on the writing of history , terming it a dismal monster .</s>

<s>Ranke and his disciples had reduced history to a profession of dullness ;
Brooks Adams preferred the chronicles of Froissart or the style and theorizing of Edward Gibbon , for at least they took a stand on the issues about which they wrote .</s>

<s>he wrote eloquently to William James that impartial history was not only impossible but undesirable .</s>

<s>if the historian was convinced of his own correctness , then he should not allow his vision to become fogged by disturbing facts .</s>

<s>it was history that must be in error , not the historian .</s>

<s>it was this basic trait that separated Adams from the ranks of professional historians and led him to commit time and time again what was his most serious offense against the historical method -- namely , the tendency to assume the truth of an hypothesis before submitting it to the test of facts .</s>

<s>all of Adams' work reflects this dogmatic characteristic .</s>

<s>no page seems to be complete without the statement of at least one unproved generalization .</s>

<s>one example of this was his assertion that all servile revolts must be dealt with by physical force .</s>

<s>there is no explanation of terms nor a qualification that most such revolts have been dealt with by force -- only a bald dogmatism that they must , because of some undefined compulsion , be so repelled .</s>

<s>on matters of race he was similarly inflexible : most of the modern Latin races seem to have inherited the rigidity of the Roman mind .</s>

<s>he cites the French Revolution as typifying this rigidity but makes no mention of the Italians , who have been able to adapt to all types of circumstances .</s>

<s>he pontificates that one of the first signs of advancing civilization is the fall in the value of women in men's eyes .</s>

<s>it made no difference that most evidence points to an opposite conclusion .</s>

<s>for Adams had made up his mind before all the facts were available .</s>

<s>all critics of Adams and his methods have observed this particular deficiency .</s>

<s>J. T. Shotwell was appalled by such spurious history as that which attributed the fall of the Carolingian empire to the woolen trade , and he urged Adams to transform his essay into a real history , embodying not merely those facts which fit into his theory , but also the modifications and exceptions .</s>

<s>A. M. Wergeland called the Adams method literally antihistorical , while Clive Day maintained that the assumptions were not confined to theories alone but were also applicable to straight factual evidence .</s>

<s>moreover , stated Day , he always omits facts which tend to disprove his hypothesis .</s>

<s>even D. A. Wasson , who compared The Emancipation Of Massachusetts to the lifting of a fog from ancient landscapes , was also forced to admit the methodological deficiencies of the author .</s>

<s>in summary , Brooks Adams felt that the nature of history was order and that the order so discovered was as much subject to historical laws as the forces of nature .</s>

<s>moreover , he believed that most professional historians lacked some of the essential instruments for a proper study of history .</s>

<s>however , despite the insight of many of his observations , his own conclusions are open to suspicion because of his failure to employ at all times the correct research methods .</s>

<s>this should not prejudice an evaluation of his findings , but they were not the findings of a completely impartial investigator .</s>

<s>what was perhaps more important than his concept of the nature of history and the historical method were those forces which shaped the direction of his thought .</s>

<s>in the final analysis his contribution to American historiography was founded on almost intuitive insights into religion , economics , and Darwinism , the three factors which conditioned his search for a law of history .</s>

<s>religion without supernaturalism Brooks Adams considered religion as an extremely significant manifestation of man's fear of the unknown .</s>

<s>but it was nothing more than that .</s>

<s>religion and the churches were institutions which had been created by man , not God .</s>

<s>he did not deny God ;
he simply did not believe that a Creator intervened or interfered in human affairs .</s>

<s>the historian need not be concerned with the philosophical problems suggested by religion .</s>

<s>there was no evidence , either of a positive or negative type , of the actions of a Divine Being in this world ;
and , since the historian should only be interested in strictly terrestrial activity , his research should eliminate the supernatural .</s>

<s>furthermore , he must regard religion as the expression of human forces .</s>

<s>certainly , he must recognize its power and attempt to ascertain its influence on the flow of history , but he must not confuse the natural and the mundane with the divine .</s>

<s>Adams was not breaking new ground when he claimed that the worship of an unseen power was in reality a reflection of man's inability to cope with his environment .</s>

<s>students of anthropology and comparative religion had long been aware that there was , indeed , a direct connection .</s>

<s>but Adams was one of the first to suggest that this human incompetence was the only motivating factor behind religion .</s>

<s>it was this fear which explained the development of a priestly caste whose function in society was to mollify and appease the angry deities .</s>

<s>to keep themselves entrenched in power , the priests were forced to demonstrate their unique status through the miracle .</s>

<s>it was the use of the supernatural that kept them in business .</s>

<s>the German barbarians of the fourth century offered an excellent example : the Germans in the fourth century were a very simple race , who comprehended little of natural laws , and who therefore referred phenomena they did not understand to supernatural intervention .</s>

<s>this intervention could only be controlled by priests , and thus the invasions caused a rapid rise in the influence of the sacred class .</s>

<s>the power of every ecclesiastical organization has always rested on the miracle , and the clergy have always proved their divine commission as did Elijah .</s>

<s>Adams contended that once such a special class had been created it became a vested interest and sought to maintain itself by assuming exclusive control over the relationships between God and man .</s>

<s>thus , the Church was born and because of its intrinsic character was soon identified as a conservative institution , determined to resist the forces of change , to identify itself with the political rulers , and to maintain a kind of splendid isolation from the masses .</s>

<s>doctrine was not only mysterious ;
it was also sacred , and no believer in an inspired church could tolerate having her canons examined as we should examine human laws .</s>

<s>these basic ideas concerning the nature of religion were , Adams believed , some of the major keys to the understanding of history and the movement of society .</s>

<s>the dark views about the Puritans found in The Emancipation Of Massachusetts were never altered .</s>

<s>despite their adherence to the status quo , the forces of organized religion were compelled to make adjustments as increasing civilization augmented human knowledge .</s>

<s>in The Law Of Civilization And Decay Brooks Adams traced this evolution , always pointing to the fact that although the forms became more rational , the substance remained unchanged .</s>

<s>the relic worship and monasticism of the Middle Ages were more advanced forms than were primitive fetish worship and nature myths .</s>

<s>yet , the idea imbedded in each was identical : to surround the unknown with mystery and to isolate that class which had been given special dominion over the secrets of God .</s>

<s>to Adams that age in which religion exercised power over the entire culture of the race was one of imagination , and it is largely the admiration he so obviously held for such eras that betrays a peculiar religiosity -- a sentiment he would have probably denied .</s>

<s>Stephens had written his classic incidents of travel about these regions a hundred years before , and Catherwood , who had studied Piranesi in London and the great ruins of Egypt and Greece , had drawn the splendid illustrations that accompanied the text .</s>

<s>Catherwood , an architect in New York , had been forgotten , like Stephens , and Victor reconstructed their lives as one reconstructs , for a museum , a dinosaur from two or three petrified bones .</s>

<s>he had unearthed Stephens's letters in a New Jersey farmhouse and he discovered Stephens's unmarked grave in an old cemetery on the east side of New York , where the great traveller had been hastily buried during a cholera epidemic .</s>

<s>Victor had been stirred by my account of him in Makers And Finders , for Stephens was one of the lost writers whom Melville had seen in his childhood and whom I was bent on resurrecting .</s>

<s>Victor had led an adventurous life .</s>

<s>his metier was the American tropics , and he had lived all over Latin America and among the primitive tribes on the Amazon river .</s>

<s>well he knew the sleepless nights , the howling sore-ridden dogs and the biting insects in the villages of the Kofanes and Huitotoes .</s>

<s>he had not yet undertaken the great exploit of his later years , the rediscovery of the ancient Inca highway , the route of Pizarro in Peru , but he had climbed to the original El Dorado , the Andean lake of Guatemala , and he had scaled the southern Sierra Nevada with its Tibetan-like people and looked into the emerald mines of Muzo .</s>

<s>as a naturalist living for two years at the headwaters of the Amazon , he had collected specimens for Mexican museums , and he had taken to the London zoo a live quetzal , the sacred bird of the old Mayans .</s>

<s>in fact , he had raised quetzal birds in his camp in the forest of Ecuador .</s>

<s>moreover , he had spent six months on the Galapagos islands , among the great turtles that Captain Cook had found there , and now and then he would disappear into some small island of the West Indies .</s>

<s>Victor's book on John Lloyd Stephens was largely written in my study in the house at Weston .</s>

<s>I had had my name taken out of the telephone book , and this was partly because of a convict who had been discharged from Sing Sing and who called me night after night .</s>

<s>he said he was a friend of Heywood Broun who had run a free employment bureau for several months during the depression , but the generous Broun to whom I wrote did not know his name and I somehow conceived the morbid notion that the man in question was prowling round the house .</s>

<s>but one day came the voice of a man I had known when he was a boy , and I later remembered that this boy , thirty years before , had struck me as coming to no good .</s>

<s>there had been something sinister about him that warned me against him , -- I had never felt that way about any other boy , -- but when he uttered his name on the telephone I had forgotten this and I was glad to do what he asked of me .</s>

<s>he was a captain , he said , in the army , and on the train to New York his purse and all his money had been stolen , and would I lend him twenty-five dollars to be given him at the General Delivery window ?</s>

<s>never hearing from him again , I remembered the little boy of whom I had had such doubts when he was ten years old .</s>

<s>we lived for a while in a movie melodrama with a German cook and her son who turned out to be Nazis .</s>

<s>finally we got them out of the house , after the boy had run away four times looking for other Nazis , threatening to murder village schoolchildren and bragging that he was to be the next Fuhrer .</s>

<s>then he began to have epileptic fits .</s>

<s>we found that a charitable society in New York had a long case-history of the two ;
and they agreed to see that the tragic pair would not put poison in anybody else's soup .</s>

<s>to the Weston house came once William Allen Neilson , the president of Smith College who had been one of my old professors and who still called me Boy when I was sixty .</s>

<s>it reminded me of my other professor , Edward Kennard Rand , of whom I had been so fond when I was at Harvard , the great mediaevalist and classical scholar who had asked me to call him Ken , saying , age counts for nothing among those who have learned to know life sub specie aeternitatis .</s>

<s>I had always thought of that lovable man as many years older than myself , although he was perhaps only twenty years older , and he confirmed my feeling , along with the feeling of both my sons , that teachers of the classics are invariably endearing .</s>

<s>I must have written to say how much I had enjoyed his fine book The Building Of Eternal Rome , and I found he had not regretted giving me the highest mark in his old course on the later Latin poets , although in my final examination I had ignored the questions and filled the bluebook with a comparison of Propertius and Coleridge .</s>

<s>he had written to me about a dinner he had had with the Benedictine monks at St. Anselm's Priory in Washington .</s>

<s>there had been reading at table , especially from two books , Pope Gregory The Great's account of St. Scholastica in his Dialogues and my own The World Of Washington Irving .</s>

<s>he said , some have criticized your book as being neither literary criticism nor history .</s>

<s>of course it was not meant to be .</s>

<s>some have felt that Washington Irving comes out rather slimly , but let them look at the title of the book .</s>

<s>he felt as I felt about this best of all my books , that it was really tops .</s>

<s>two or three times , C. C. Burlingham came to lunch with us in Weston , that wonderful man who lived to be more than a hundred years old and whose birthplace had been my Wall Street suburb .</s>

<s>his reading ranged from Agatha Christie to The Book Of Job and he had an insatiable interest in his fellow-creatures , while his letters were full of gossip about new politicians and old men of letters with whom he had been intimately thrown six decades before .</s>

<s>I could never forget the gaiety with which , when he was both blind and deaf , he let me lead him around his rooms to look at some of the pictures ;
and once when he came to see us in New York he walked away in a rainstorm , unwilling to hear of a taxi or even an umbrella , although he was at the time ninety years old .</s>

<s>there were several men of ninety or more whom I knew first or last , all of whom were still productive and most of whom knew one another as if they had naturally come together at the apex of their lives .</s>

<s>I never met John Dewey , whose style was a sort of verbal fog and who had written asking me to go to Mexico with him when he was investigating the cause of Trotsky ;
but I liked to think of him at ninety swimming and working at Key West long after Hemingway had moved to Cuba .</s>

<s>at Lee Simonson's house , I had dined with Edith Hamilton , the nonogenarian rationalist and the charming scholar who had a great popular success with The Greek Way .</s>

<s>then there was Mark Howe and there was Henry Dwight Sedgwick , an accomplished man of letters who wrote in the spirit of Montaigne and produced in the end a formidable body of work .</s>

<s>I saw Sedgwick often before his death at ninety-five , -- he had remarried at the age of ninety , -- and he asked me , when once I returned from Rome , if I knew the Cavallinis in the church of St. Cecilia in Trastevere .</s>

<s>I had to confess that I had missed these frescoes , recently discovered , that he had studied in his eighties .</s>

<s>Sedgwick had chosen to follow the philosophy of Epicurus whom , with his followers , Dante put in hell ;
but he defended the doctrine in The Art Of Happiness , and what indeed could be said against the Epicurean virtues , health , frugality , privacy , culture and friendship ?</s>

<s>of Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe the philosopher Whitehead said the Earth's first visitors to Mars should be persons likely to make a good impression , and when he was asked , whom would you send ?</s>

<s>he replied , my first choice would be Mark Howe .</s>

<s>this friend of many years came once to visit us in the house at Weston .</s>

<s>then I spoke at the ninetieth birthday party of W. E. Burghardt Du Bois , who embarked on a fictional trilogy at eighty-nine and who , with The Crisis , had created a Negro intelligentsia that had never existed in America before him .</s>

<s>as their interpreter and guide , he had broken with Tuskegee and become a spokesman of the coloured people of the world .</s>

<s>Mr. Burlingham , -- C.C.B.</s>

<s>-- wrote to me once about an old friend of mine , S. K. Ratcliffe , whom I had first met in London in 1914 and who also came out for a week-end in Weston .</s>

<s>did you ever know a man with greater zest for information ?</s>

<s>and his memory , like an elephant's , stored with precise knowledge of men and things and happenings .</s>

<s>his wife , Katie , as gay as a lark and as lively as a gazelle , -- she was then seventy-six , -- had a sense of humour that has been denied S.K.</s>

<s>, but neither has any aesthetic perceptions .</s>

<s>people and books are enough for them .</s>

<s>S.K.</s>

<s>was visiting C.C.B.</s>

<s>and , not waiting for breakfast , he was off to the University Club , where he spent hours writing obituaries of living Americans for The Manchester Guardian or The Glasgow Herald .</s>

<s>later , rising ninety , he was beset by publishers for the story of his life and miracles , as he put it , but , calling himself the Needy Knife-grinder , he had spent his time writing short articles and long letters and could not get even a small popular book done .</s>

<s>then , all but blind , he said there was nothing in Back to Methuselah -- G.B.S.</s>

<s>ought to have known that , -- and I look at my bookshelves despairingly , knowing that I can have nothing more to do with them .</s>

<s>however , at eighty-five , he had still been busy writing articles , reviewing and speaking , and I had never before known an Englishman who had visited and lectured in three quarters of the United States .</s>

<s>finally , colleges and clubs took the line that speakers from England were not wanted any longer , even speakers like S.K.</s>

<s>, so unlike the novelists and poets who had patronized the Americans for many years .</s>

<s>with their facile generalizations about the United States , these mediocrities , as they often were , had been great successes .</s>

<s>while S.K.</s>

<s>did not like Dylan Thomas , I liked his poems very much , but I made the mistake of telling Dylan Thomas so , whereupon he said to me , I suppose you think you know all about me .</s>

<s>I should have replied , I probably know something about the best part of you .</s>

<s>but I only thought of that in the middle of the night .</s>

<s>many years later I went to see S.K.</s>

<s>in England , where he was living at Whiteleaf , near Aylesbury , and he showed me beside his cottage there the remains of the road on which Boadicea is supposed to have travelled .</s>

<s>he was convinced that George Orwell's 1984 was nearly all wrong as it applied to England , which was driving forward into uncharted waters , with the danger of a new tyranny ahead .</s>

<s>but however we go , whatever our doom , it will not take the Orwellian shape .</s>

<s>with facts mainly in his mind , he was often acute in the matter of style , and he said , the young who have as yet nothing to say will try larks with initial letters and broken lines .</s>

<s>but put them before a situation which they are forced to depict , -- he was speaking of the Spanish civil war , -- and they have no hesitation ;
they merely do their best to make it real for others .</s>

<s>he looked at her as she spoke , then got up as she was speaking still , and , simply and wordlessly , walked out .</s>

<s>and that was the end .</s>

<s>or nearly .</s>

<s>he went to the Hotel Mayflower and telegraphed Mencken .</s>

<s>would he meet him in Baltimore in Drawing Room J , Car Three on the train leaving Washington at nine o'clock next morning ?</s>

<s>they would go to New York together , where parties would be piled on weariness and on misery .</s>

<s>but not for long .</s>

<s>both Alfred Harcourt and Donald Brace had written him enthusiastic praise of Elmer Gantry ( any changes could be made in proof , which was already coming from the printer ) and they had ordered 140,000 copies -- the largest first printing of any book in history .</s>

<s>but none of this could soothe the exacerbated nerves .</s>

<s>on New Year's Eve , Alfred Harcourt drove him up the Hudson to Bill Brown's Training Camp , a well-known establishment for the speedy if temporary rehabilitation of drunkards who could no longer help themselves .</s>

<s>but , in departing , Lewis begged Breasted that there be no liquor in the apartment at the Grosvenor on his return , and he took with him the first thirty galleys of Elmer Gantry .</s>

<s>on January 4 , with the boys back at school and college , Mrs. Lewis wrote Harcourt to say that she was through , quite through .</s>

<s>this whole Washington venture was my last gesture , and it has failed .</s>

<s>physically as well as mentally I have reached the limit of my endurance .</s>

<s>my last gift to him is complete silence until the book is out and the first heated discussion dies down .</s>

<s>for him to divorce God and wife simultaneously would be bad publicity .</s>

<s>I am really ill at the present moment , and I will go to some sort of a sanitarium to normalize myself .</s>

<s>and she withdrew then to Cromwell Hall , in Cromwell , Connecticut .</s>

<s>Harcourt replied : I do really hope you can achieve serenity in the course of time .</s>

<s>of course I hope Hal can also , but those hopes are much more faint .</s>

<s>8 on January 8 , 1927 , he returned to the Grosvenor in high spirits , and looking fit .</s>

<s>he had been , he wrote Mencken at once , in the country , a euphemism for an experience that had not greatly changed him .</s>

<s>Charles Breasted remembers that , before unpacking his bag , he telephoned his bootlegger with a generous order , and almost at once the familiar procession of people began milling through our living room at any hour between two P.M. and three A.M. .</s>

<s>they were strays of every kind -- university students and journalists , Village hangers-on and barflies , taxi drivers and editors and unknown poets , as well as friends like Elinor Wylie and William Rose Benet , the Van Dorens and Nathan , Rebecca West and Hugh Walpole and Osbert Sitwell , Laurence Stallings , Lewis Browne , William Seabrook , Arthur Hopkins , the Woodwards .</s>

<s>when he came home from his office at the end of the afternoon , Breasted never knew what gathering he should expect to find , but there almost always was one .</s>

<s>he did not neglect his wife in Cromwell Hall , but telephoned her and wrote her with assurances of his continuing interest and of his wish to stand behind her in their separation and of his hope that there would be no bitterness between them .</s>

<s>she was occupying herself in an attempt to write an article about the variety of houses that they had rented abroad .</s>

<s>he was of unsettled mind as to whether he should go abroad when the Gantry galleys were finished .</s>

<s>for a time , urging Breasted to give up his public relations work and take up writing instead , he hoped to persuade him to become his assistant in research for the labor novel ;
if Breasted agreed , they would get a car and tour the country , visiting every kind of industrial center .</s>

<s>when Breasted insisted that this was impossible for him , Lewis decided to go abroad .</s>

<s>he telephoned L. M. Birkhead and asked him and his wife to come to Europe as his guests , but Birkhead declined on the grounds that one of them must be in the United States when Elmer Gantry was published .</s>

<s>Lewis was spending his mornings , with the help of two secretaries , on the galleys of that long novel , making considerable revisions , and the combination of hard work and hard frivolity exhausted him once more , so that he was compelled to spend three days in the Harbor Sanatorium in the last week of January .</s>

<s>before he made that retreat , he telephoned Earl Blackman in Kansas City and asked him to come to Europe with him .</s>

<s>Blackman was to be in New York by February 2 , because they were sailing at 12:01 next morning .</s>

<s>Lewis told him what clothes he should bring along , and enjoined him not to buy anything that he did not already own , they would do that in New York .</s>

<s>Blackman arrived a day or two early , and Lewis took him to a department store immediately and outfitted him , luggage and all , and then he took him to a party at the Woodwards that went on until four in the morning .</s>

<s>on the evening that they were to sail , Lewis himself gave a party , but he was too indisposed to appear at it .</s>

<s>Woodward took occasion to warn Blackman about Lewis's drinking and urged him to try to keep him sober .</s>

<s>after a dinner party for which she had come down to New York , Mrs. Lewis and Casanova arrived to see them off , and Elinor Wylie made tart observations that indicated that Lewis had been less discreet than he had promised to be about the real nature of their separation .</s>

<s>nevertheless , Mrs. Lewis was still solicitous of his condition : let him do as he wished , let him sleep with chambermaids if he must , but , she begged Blackman , try to keep him from drinking a great deal and bring him back in good health .</s>

<s>as they stood at the first-class rail , waving down to his wife and Casanova below , Lewis said , Earl , there is Gracie's future husband .</s>

<s>and when questioned by ship's reporters about the separation , she said , I adore him , and he adores me .</s>

<s>Blackman had brought news from Kansas City .</s>

<s>before his departure , a group of his friends , the Reverend Stidger among them , had given him a luncheon , and Stidger had seen advance sheets of Elmer Gantry .</s>

<s>he was outraged by the book and announced that he had discovered fifty technical errors in its account of church practices .</s>

<s>L. M. Birkhead challenged him to name one and he was silent .</s>

<s>but his rancor did not cease , and presently , on March 13 , when he preached a sermon on the text , and Ben-hadad Was Drunk , he told his congregation how disappointed he was in Mr. Lewis , how he regretted having had him in his house , and how he should have been warned by the fact that the novelist was drunk all the time that he was working on the book .</s>

<s>but that sermon , like those of hundreds of other ministers , was yet to be delivered .</s>

<s>in London Lewis took the usual suite in Bury Street .</s>

<s>to the newspapers he talked about his unquiet life , about his wish to be a newspaperman once more , about the prevalence of American slang in British speech , about the loquacity of the English and the impossibility of finding quiet in a railway carriage , about his plans to wander for two years unless stopped and made to write another book .</s>

<s>the Manchester Guardian wondered how anyone in a railway carriage would have an opportunity to talk to Mr. Lewis , since it was well known that Mr. Lewis always did all of the talking .</s>

<s>his English friends , it said , had gone into training to keep up with him vocally and with his allegro movements around the luncheon table .</s>

<s>the New York Times editorialist wondered just who would stop Mr. Lewis and make him write a book .</s>

<s>Lewis's remarks about his marriage were suggestive enough to induce American reporters to invade the offices of Harcourt , Brace & Company for information , to pursue Mrs. Lewis to Cromwell Hall , and , after she had returned to New York , to ferret her out at the Stanhope on upper Fifth Avenue where she had taken an apartment .</s>

<s>there , to the Evening Post , she emphatically denied the divorce rumors and explained that she had stayed behind because of the schooling of their son , which henceforth would be strictly American .</s>

<s>these rumors of permanent separation started up a whole crop of stories about her .</s>

<s>one had it that a friend , protesting her snobbery , said , but , Gracie , you are an American , aren't you ?</s>

<s>and she replied , I was born in America , but I was conceived in Vienna .</s>

<s>Lewis himself furthered these tales .</s>

<s>he is said to have reported that once , when she went to a hospital to call on a friend after a serious operation , and the friend protested that it had been nothing , she replied , well , it was your healthy American peasant blood that pulled you through .</s>

<s>with these and similar tales he was entertaining his English friends , all of whom he was seeing when he was not showing Blackman the sights of London and its environs .</s>

<s>at once upon his arrival , he telephoned Lady Sybil Colefax who invited them to tea , and then Lewis decided to give a party as a quick way of rounding up his friends .</s>

<s>he invited Lady Sybil , Lord Thomson , Bechhofer Roberts , and a half dozen others .</s>

<s>it was a dinner party , Lewis had been drinking during the afternoon , and long before the party really got under way , he was quite drunk , with the result that the party broke up even before dinner was over .</s>

<s>Lewis , at the head of the table , would leap up and move around behind the chairs of his guests making remarks that , when not highly offensive , were at least highly inappropriate , and then presently he collapsed and was put to bed .</s>

<s>when Blackman emerged from the bedroom , everyone was gone except the tolerant Lord Thomson , who stayed and chatted with him for half an hour , and then Blackman lay awake most of that night , despairing of what he must expect on the Continent .</s>

<s>finally , at dawn , he fell asleep , and when he awoke and came into the living room , he found Lewis in his pajamas before the fire , smoking a cigarette .</s>

<s>Blackman said that he wanted to apologize for not having prevented Lewis from making that horrible spectacle of himself , that he should have seized him by the neck at once and forcibly hauled him into his bedroom .</s>

<s>Lewis warned him never to lay a hand on him , and then Blackman asked for his fare back to the United States .</s>

<s>Lewis looked at him and began to cry , and then , saying that he was going to make a promise , he asked Blackman to call the porter and to tell him to take out all the liquor that he did not want .</s>

<s>and from now on , for the rest of this trip , I will only drink what you agree that I should drink .</s>

<s>Blackman called the porter and had him remove everything but one bottle of brandy , and after that they would have a cocktail or two before dinner , or , on one of their walking trips , beer , or , in France and Italy , wine in moderation .</s>

<s>Lewis gave him a guidebook tour of London and , motoring and walking , took him to Stratford , but the London stay was for only ten days , and on the twentieth they took the train for Southampton , where they spent the night for an early morning Channel crossing .</s>

<s>near Southampton , in a considerable establishment , lived Homer Vachell , a well-known pulp writer , and his brother , Horace -- both friends of Lewis's .</s>

<s>he suggested that they call on these brothers , who received them pleasantly .</s>

<s>then they returned to their hotel and got ready for bed .</s>

<s>it was late , and Blackman was ready to go to sleep , but Lewis was not .</s>

<s>he said , we had a good time tonight , didn't we , Earl ?</s>

<s>Earl agreed , and Lewis said that it would have been very different if his wife had been with him .</s>

<s>then he kept Blackman awake for more than an hour while he did an imaginary dialogue between his wife and himself in which , discussing the evening , he was continually berated .</s>

<s>he began the dialogue by having his wife announce that one does not invade people's homes without warning them that one is coming , and went on from that with the entire catalogue of his social gaucheries .</s>

<s>from 1613 on , if the lists exist , they contain between twenty to thirty names .</s>

<s>as the total number of incepting bachelors in 1629 was , according to Masson ( Life , 1:218 ) and J , two hundred fifty-nine , the twenty-four names listed in the ordo senioritatis for that year constitute slightly less than one tenth of the total number of bachelors who then incepted .</s>

<s>there were four from St. John's and four from Christ's , three from Pembroke , and two from each of the colleges , Jesus , Peterhouse , Queens' , and Trinity , with Caius , Clare , King's , Magdalene , and Sidney supplying one each in the ordo senioritatis .</s>

<s>as 1624 , a mistake for 1629 .</s>

<s>Manningham also proceeded M.A.</s>

<s>in 1632 and became a fellow of his college in that year .</s>

<s>( John ) Boutflower of Christ's was twelfth in the list , coming from Perse School under Mr. Lovering as pensioner 20 April 1625 under Mr. Alsop .</s>

<s>the fourteenth name was ( Richard ) Buckenham , written Buckman , admitted to Christ's College under Scott 2 July 1625 .</s>

<s>the fifteenth name was ( Thomas ) Baldwin , admitted to Christ's 4 March 1625 under Alsop .</s>

<s>Christ's College was well represented that year in the ordo , and the name highest on the list from that college was Milton's , fourth in the entire university .</s>

<s>small wonder that Milton later boasted of how well his work had been received there , since he attained a rank in the order of commencing bachelors higher than that of any other inceptor from Christ's of that year .</s>

<s>it is not possible to reconstruct fully the arrangements whereby these honors lists were then made up or even how the names that they contained assumed the order in which we find them .</s>

<s>the process usually began with a tutor boasting about a boy , as Chappell had boasted about Lightfoot , to the higher officers of the college and university .</s>

<s>then the various officers of the college might take up the case .</s>

<s>it would , however , reach the proctors and other officers in charge of the public-school performances of the incepting bachelors , and the place that any individual obtained in the lists depended greatly on how he comported himself in the public schools during his acts therein as he was incepting .</s>

<s>of course the higher officials could add or place a name on the list wherever they wished .</s>

<s>Milton's name being fourth is neither too high nor too low to be assigned to the arbitrary action of vice-chancellor , proctor , master , or other mighty hand .</s>

<s>he evidently earned the place assigned him .</s>

<s>recapitulation of Milton's undergraduate career looking back from the spring of 1629 over the four years of Milton's undergraduate days , certain phases of his college career stand out as of permanent consequence to him and hence to us .</s>

<s>of course the principal factor in the whole experience was the kind of education he received .</s>

<s>it differed from what an undergraduate receives today from any American college or university mainly in the certainty of what he was forced to learn compared with the loose and widely scattered information obtained today by most of our undergraduates .</s>

<s>Milton was required to absorb and display an intensive and accurate knowledge of Latin grammar , logic-rhetoric , ethics , physics or natural philosophy , metaphysics , and Latin , Greek , and Hebrew .</s>

<s>he had also sampled various special fields of learning , being unable to miss some study of divinity , Justinian ( law ) , and Galen ( medicine ) .</s>

<s>above all , he had learned to write formal Latin prose and verse to a remarkable degree of artistry .</s>

<s>he had learned to dispute devastatingly , both formally and informally in Latin , and according to the rules on any topic , pro or con , drawn from almost any subject , more especially from Aristotle's works .</s>

<s>he could produce carefully constructed orations , set and formal speeches , artfully and prayerfully made by writing and rewriting with all the aid his tutor and others could provide , and then delivered verbatim from memory .</s>

<s>he had also learned to dispute extempore remarkably well , the main evidence for which of course is the presence of his name in the honors list of 1628/29 .</s>

<s>he also displayed the ability to write Latin verse on almost any topic of dispute , the verses , of course , to be delivered from memory .</s>

<s>then we have surviving at least one instance of a poem prepared for another , in Naturam non Pati Senium , and perhaps also the De Idea Platonica .</s>

<s>but his greatest achievement , in his own eyes and in the eyes of his colleagues and teachers , was his amazing ability to produce literary Latin pieces , and he was often called on to do so .</s>

<s>these were his public academic activities , domi forisque , in the college and in the university .</s>

<s>and his performances attracted much attention , as the frequency of his surviving pieces in any calendar that may be set up for his undergraduate activities testifies .</s>

<s>his other activities are not so easily recovered .</s>

<s>his statements about sports and exercises of a physical nature are suggestive , but inconclusive .</s>

<s>his later boastings of his skill with the small sword are indicative of much time and practice devoted to the use of that weapon .</s>

<s>Venn and others have dealt with sports and pastimes at Cambridge in Milton's day with not very specific results .</s>

<s>Milton himself , uncommunicative as he is about his lesser and nonliterary activities , at least gives us some evidence that he was a great walker , under any and all conditions .</s>

<s>his early poems and some of his prose prolusions speak of wanderings in the city and the neighboring country that may be extended to Cambridge and its surrounding countryside .</s>

<s>the town itself and the reedy Cam he often visited , as did all in the university .</s>

<s>the churches , the taverns , and the various other places of the town must have known his figure well as he roved to and about them .</s>

<s>the tiny hamlet of Chesterton to the north , with the fens and marshes lying on down the Ouse River , may have attracted him often , as it did many other youths of the time .</s>

<s>the Gog Magog Hills to the southeast afforded him and all other students a vantage point from which to view the town and university of their dwelling .</s>

<s>the country about Cambridge is flat and not particularly spectacular in its scenery , though it offers easy going to the foot traveler .</s>

<s>ball games , especially football , required some attention , and other organized sports may have attracted him as participant or spectator .</s>

<s>he smoked , as did everybody , and imbibed the various alcoholic beverages of that day , although his protestations while at Cambridge and after that he was no drunkard point to reasonable abstinence from the wild drinking bouts of some of the undergraduates and , we must add , of some of their elders including many of the regents or teachers .</s>

<s>what manner of person does Milton appear to have been when as an undergraduate he resided at Christ's College ?</s>

<s>he was then a slightly built young man of pleasing appearance , medium stature , and handsome face .</s>

<s>graceful as his fencing and dancing lessons had taught him to be in addition to the natural grace of his slight , wiry frame , he cut enough of a figure to have evoked a nickname in the college , to which he himself referred in Prolusion 6 :
a quibusdam , audivi nuper Domina .</s>

<s>that is , if we can trust that most specious of prolusions , packed as it is with wit and persiflage .</s>

<s>the Domina sounds real enough , if we could only trust the conditions under which we learn of its use ;
but anyone who would put much trust in any phase of Prolusion 6 except its illusive allusiveness deserves whatever fate may be meted out to him by virtue of the egregiously stilted banter .</s>

<s>in short , the traditional epithet for Milton of Lady of Christ's , while eminently fitting , rests only on this baffling passage in the midst of the most treacherous piece of writing Milton left us .</s>

<s>Aubrey's mention of it ( 2:67 , and Bodleian J Aubr.</s>

<s>8 , F. 63 ) comes from this prolusion , through Christopher Milton or Edward Phillips .</s>

<s>it is not a question of truth or falsity ;
the prolusion in which the autobiographic statement about the epithet occurs is such a mass of intentionally buried allusions that almost nothing in it can be accepted as true -- or discarded as false .</s>

<s>the entire exercise , Latin and English , is most suggestive of the kind of person Milton had become at Christ's during his undergraduate career ;
the mere fact that he was selected , though as a substitute , to act as interlocutor or moderator for it , or perhaps we should say with Buck as father of the act , is in itself a difficult phase of his development to grasp .</s>

<s>Milton was to act as the archfool , the supreme wit , the lightly bantering pater , Pater Liber , who could at once trip lightly over that which deserved such treatment , or could at will annihilate the common enemies of the college gathering , and with words alone .</s>

<s>from an exercise involving merely raucous , rough-and-tumble comedy , in his hands the performance turned into a revel of wit and word play , indecent at times , but always learned , pointed , and carefully aimed at some individuals present , and at the whole assembly .</s>

<s>to do this successfully required great skill and a special talent for both solemn and ribald raillery , a talent not bestowed on many persons , but one with which Milton was marked as being endowed and in which , at least in this performance , he obviously reveled .</s>

<s>it may be thought unfortunate that he was called on entirely by accident to perform , if again we may trust the opening of the oratio , for it marks the beginning for us of his use of his peculiar form of witty word play that even in this Latin banter has in it the unmistakable element of viciousness and an almost sadistic delight in verbally tormenting an adversary .</s>

<s>but the real beginnings of this development in him go back to the opposing of grammar school , and probably if it had not been this occasion and these Latin lines it would have been some others , such as the first prolusion , that set off this streak in him of unbridled and scathing verbal attack on an enemy .</s>

<s>all western Europe would hear and listen to him in this same vein about the middle of the century .</s>

<s>but these prolusions that we have surviving from the Christ's College days are only one phase of his existence then .</s>

<s>perhaps his most important private activity was the combination of reading , discussion with a few -- if we can trust his writings to Diodati and the younger Gill , very few -- congenial companions .</s>

<s>lines 23-36 of Lycidas later point to a friendship with Edward King , who entered Christ's College 9 June 1626 .</s>

<s>no other names among the young men in residence at the time seem to have been even suggested by Milton as those of persons with whom he in any way consorted .</s>

<s>but that scarcely means that he was the aloof , forbidding type of student who shared few if any activities with his fellows , the banter of the surviving prolusions providing enough evidence to deny this .</s>

<s>apparently he was not a participant in the college or university theatricals , which he once attacked as utterly unworthy performances ( see Apology 3:300 ) ;
but even in that famous passage , Milton was aiming not at the theatricals as such but at their performance by persons either enter'd , or presently to enter into the ministry .</s>

<s>the fact that he nowhere mentioned theatrical performances as part of the activities of the boys later in his hypothetical academy ( 1644 ) should not be taken too seriously as evidence that he desired them to eschew such performances .</s>

<s>perhaps , in that short piece or letter written to Hartlib in which he sketched his scheme for educating young men , he merely overlooked that phase of their exercises .</s>

<s>writers of this class of science fiction have clearly in mind the assumptions that man can master the principles of this cause-and-effect universe and that such mastery will necessarily better the human lot .</s>

<s>on the other hand , the bright vision of the future has been directly stated in science fiction concerned with projecting ideal societies -- science fiction , of course , is related , if sometimes distantly , to that utopian literature optimistic about science , literature whose period of greatest vigor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries produced Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward and H. G. Wells's A Modern Utopia .</s>

<s>in Arthur Clarke's Childhood's End ( 1953 ) , though written after the present flood of dystopias began , we can see the bright vision of science fiction clearly defined .</s>

<s>Childhood's End -- apparently indebted to Kurd Lasswitz's Utopian romance , auf Zwei Planeten ( 1897 ) , and also to Wells's Histories Of The Future , especially , The World Set Free ( 1914 ) and The Shape Of Things To Come ( 1933 ) -- describes the bloodless conquest of earth by the Overlords , vastly superior creatures who come to our world in order to prepare the human race for its next stage of development , an eventual merging with the composite mind of the universe .</s>

<s>arriving just in time to stop men from turning their planet into a radioactive wasteland , the Overlords unite earth into one world in which justice , order , and benevolence prevail and ignorance , poverty , and fear have ceased to exist .</s>

<s>under their rule , earth becomes a technological utopia .</s>

<s>both abolition of war and new techniques of production , particularly robot factories , greatly increase the world's wealth , a situation described in the following passage , which has the true utopian ring : everything was so cheap that the necessities of life were free , provided as a public service by the community , as roads , water , street lighting and drainage had once been .</s>

<s>a man could travel anywhere he pleased , eat whatever he fancied -- without handing over any money .</s>

<s>with destructive tensions and pressures removed men have the vigor and energy to construct a new human life -- rebuilding entire cities , expanding facilities for entertainment , providing unlimited opportunities for education -- indeed , for the first time giving everyone the chance to employ his talents to the fullest .</s>

<s>mankind , as a result , attains previously undreamed of levels of civilization and culture , a golden age which the Overlords , a very evident symbol of science , have helped produce by introducing reason and the scientific method into human activities .</s>

<s>thus science is the savior of mankind , and in this respect Childhood's End only blueprints in greater detail the vision of the future which , though not always so directly stated , has nevertheless been present in the minds of most science-fiction writers .</s>

<s>considering then the optimism which has permeated science fiction for so long , what is really remarkable is that during the last twelve years many science-fiction writers have turned about and attacked their own cherished vision of the future , have attacked the Childhood's End kind of faith that science and technology will inevitably better the human condition .</s>

<s>and they have done this on a very large scale , with a veritable flood of novels and stories which are either dystopias or narratives of adventure with dystopian elements .</s>

<s>because of the means of publication -- science-fiction magazines and cheap paperbacks -- and because dystopian science fiction is still appearing in quantity the full range and extent of this phenomenon can hardly be known , though one fact is evident : the science-fiction imagination has been immensely fertile in its extrapolations .</s>

<s>among the dystopias , for example , Isaac Asimov's The Caves Of Steel ( 1954 ) portrays the deadly effects on human life of the super-city of the future ;
James Blish's A Case Of Conscience ( 1958 ) describes a world hiding from its own weapons of destruction in underground shelters ;
Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 ( 1954 ) presents a book-burning society in which wall television and hearing-aid radios enslave men's minds ;
Walter M. Miller , Jr.'s , A Canticle For Leibowitz ( 1959 ) finds men , after the great atomic disaster , stumbling back to their previous level of civilization and another catastrophe ;
Frederick Pohl's The Midas Touch ( 1954 ) predicts an economy of abundance which , in order to remain prosperous , must set its robots to consuming surplus production ;
Clifford D. Simak's How-2 ( 1954 ) tells of a future when robots have taken over , leaving men nothing to do ;
and Robert Sheckley's The Status Civilization ( 1960 ) describes a world which , frightened by the powers of destruction science has given it , becomes static and conformist .</s>

<s>a more complete list would also include Bradbury's The Pedestrian ( 1951 ) , Philip K. Dick's Solar Lottery ( 1955 ) , David Karp's One ( 1953 ) , Wilson Tucker's The Long Loud Silence ( 1952 ) , Jack Vance's To Live Forever ( 1956 ) , Gore Vidal's Messiah ( 1954 ) , and Bernard Wolfe's Limbo ( 1952 ) , as well as the three perhaps most outstanding dystopias , Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth's The Space Merchants ( 1953 ) , Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano ( 1952 ) , and John Wyndham's Re-Birth ( 1953 ) , works which we will later examine in detail .</s>

<s>the novels and stories like Pohl's Drunkard's Walk ( 1960 ) , with the focus on adventure and with the dystopian elements only a dim background -- in this case an uneasy , overpopulated world in which the mass of people do uninteresting routine jobs while a carefully selected , university-trained elite runs everything -- are in all likelihood as numerous as dystopias .</s>

<s>there is , of course , nothing new about dystopias , for they belong to a literary tradition which , including also the closely related satiric utopias , stretches from at least as far back as the eighteenth century and Swift's Gulliver's Travels to the twentieth century and Zamiatin's We , Capek's War With The Newts , Huxley's Brave New World , E. M. Forster's The Machine Stops , C. S. Lewis's That Hideous Strength , and Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four , and which in science fiction is represented before the present deluge as early as Wells's trilogy , The Time Machine , A Story Of The Days To Come , and When The Sleeper Wakes , and as recently as Jack Williamson's With Folded Hands ( 1947 ) , the classic story of men replaced by their own robots .</s>

<s>what makes the current phenomenon unique is that so many science-fiction writers have reversed a trend and turned to writing works critical of the impact of science and technology on human life .</s>

<s>since the great flood of these dystopias has appeared only in the last twelve years , it seems fairly reasonable to assume that the chief impetus was the 1949 publication of Nineteen Eighty-Four , an assumption which is supported by the frequent echoes of such details as Room 101 , along with education by conditioning from Brave New World , a book to which science-fiction writers may well have returned with new interest after reading the more powerful Orwell dystopia .</s>

<s>not all recent science fiction , however , is dystopian , for the optimistic strain is still very much alive in Mission Of Gravity and Childhood's End , as we have seen , as well as in many other recent popular novels and stories like Fred Hoyle's The Black Cloud ( 1957 ) ;
and among works of dystopian science fiction , not all provide intelligent criticism and very few have much merit as literature -- but then real quality has always been scarce in science fiction .</s>

<s>in addition , there are many areas of the human situation besides the impact of science and technology which are examined , for science-fiction dystopias often extrapolate political , social , economic tendencies only indirectly related to science and technology .</s>

<s>nevertheless , with all these qualifications and exceptions , the current dystopian phenomenon remains impressive for its criticism that science and technology , instead of bringing utopia , may well enslave , dehumanize , and even destroy men .</s>

<s>how effectively these warnings can be presented is seen in Pohl and Kornbluth's The Space Merchants , Vonnegut's Player Piano and Wyndham's Re-Birth .</s>

<s>easily the best known of these three novels is The Space Merchants , a good example of a science-fiction dystopia which extrapolates much more than the impact of science on human life , though its most important warning is in this area , namely as to the use to which discoveries in the behavioral sciences may be put .</s>

<s>the novel , which is not merely dystopian but also brilliantly satiric , describes a future America where one-sixteenth of the population , the men who run advertising agencies and big corporations , control the rest of the people , the submerged fifteen-sixteenths who are the workers and consumers , with the government being no more than a clearing house for pressures .</s>

<s>like ours , the economy of the space merchants must constantly expand in order to survive , and , like ours , it is based on the principle of ever increasing everybody's work and profits in the circle of consumption .</s>

<s>the consequences , of course , have been dreadful : reckless expansion has led to overpopulation , pollution of the earth and depletion of its natural resources .</s>

<s>for example , even the most successful executive lives in a two-room apartment while ordinary people rent space in the stairwells of office buildings in which to sleep at night ;
soyaburgers have replaced meat , and wood has become so precious that it is saved for expensive jewelry ;
and the atmosphere is so befouled that no one dares walk in the open without respirators or soot plugs .</s>

<s>while the Space Merchants indicates , as Kingsley Amis has correctly observed , some of the impending consequences of the growth of industrial and commercial power and satirizes existing habits in the advertising profession , its warning and analysis penetrate much deeper .</s>

<s>what is wrong with advertising is not only that it is an outrage , an assault on people's mental privacy or that it is a major cause for a wasteful economy of abundance or that it contains a coercive tendency ( which is closer to the point ) .</s>

<s>rather what Kornbluth and Pohl are really doing is warning against the dangers inherent in perfecting a science of man and his motives .</s>

<s>The Space Merchants , like such humanist documents as Joseph Wood Krutch's The Measure Of Man and C. S. Lewis's The Abolition Of Man , considers what may result from the scientific study of human nature .</s>

<s>if man is actually the product of his environment and if science can discover the laws of human nature and the ways in which environment determines what people do , then someone -- a someone probably standing outside traditional systems of values -- can turn around and develop completely efficient means for controlling people .</s>

<s>thus we will have a society consisting of the planners or conditioners , and the controlled .</s>

<s>and this , of course , is exactly what Madison Avenue has been accused of doing albeit in a primitive way , with its hidden persuaders and what the space merchants accomplish with much greater sophistication and precision .</s>

<s>Pohl and Kornbluth's ad men have long since thrown out appeals to reason and developed techniques of advertising which tie in with every basic trauma and neurosis in American life , which work on the libido of consumers , which are linked to the great prime motivations of the human spirit .</s>

<s>as the hero , Mitchell Courtenay , explains before his conversion , the job of advertising is to convince people without letting them know that they're being convinced .</s>

<s>and to do this requires first of all the kind of information about people which is provided by the scientists in industrial anthropology and consumer research , who , for example , tell Courtenay that three days is the optimum priming period for a closed social circuit to be triggered with a catalytic cue-phrase -- which means that an effective propaganda technique is to send an idea into circulation and then three days later reinforce or undermine it .</s>

<s>and the second requirement for convincing people without their knowledge is artistic talent to prepare the words and pictures which persuade by using the principles which the scientists have discovered .</s>

<s>thus the copywriter in the world of the space merchants is the person who in earlier ages might have been a lyric poet , the person capable of putting together words that stir and move and sing .</s>

<s>as Courtenay explains , here in this profession we reach into the souls of men and women .</s>

<s>and we do it by taking talent -- and redirecting it .</s>

<s>now the basic question to be asked in this situation is what motivates the manipulators , that is , what are their values ?</s>

<s>-- since , as Courtenay says , nobody should play with lives the way we do unless he's motivated by the highest ideals .</s>

<s>but the only ideal he can think of is Sales ]
indeed , again and again , the space merchants confirm the prediction of the humanists that the conditioners and behavioral scientists , once they have seen through human nature , will have nothing except their impulses and desires to guide them .</s>

<s>we often say of a person that he looks young for his age or old for his age .</s>

<s>yet even in the more extreme of such cases we seldom go very far astray in guessing what his age actually is .</s>

<s>and this means , I suppose , that almost invariably age reveals itself by easily recognizable signs engraved on both the body and the mind .</s>

<s>young for his age means only the presence of some minor characteristic not quite usual .</s>

<s>stigmata quite sufficient for diagnosis are nevertheless there .</s>

<s>an assumption of youth , or the presence of a few youthful characteristics , deceives no more successfully than rouge or dyed hair .</s>

<s>looking young for your age means for your age and it means no more .</s>

<s>a mind expressing itself in words may reveal itself a little less obviously as old or young .</s>

<s>its surface loses its bloom and submits to its wrinkles in ways less immediately obvious than the body does .</s>

<s>youth may be , and often is , skeptical , cynical or despairing ;
age may be idealistic , believing and much given to professions of optimism .</s>

<s>but there is , nevertheless , always a subtle difference in the way in which supposedly similar opinions are held .</s>

<s>the pessimism of the young is defiant , anxious to confess or even exaggerate its ostensible gloom , and so exuberant as to reveal the fact that it regards its ability to face up to the awful truth as more than enough to compensate for the awfulness of that truth .</s>

<s>similarly the optimism of age protests too much .</s>

<s>if it proclaims that the best is yet to be , it always arouses , at least in the young , either a suspicious question or perhaps the exclamation of the Negro youth who saw on a tombstone the inscription , I am not dead but sleeping .</s>

<s>boy , you ain't fooling nobody but yourself .</s>

<s>we may say of some unfortunates that they were never young .</s>

<s>we cannot truthfully say of anyone who has succeeded in entering deep into his sixties that he was never old .</s>

<s>those famous lines of the Greek Anthology with which a fading beauty dedicates her mirror at the shrine of a goddess reveal a wise attitude : Venus , take my votive glass , since I am not what I was , what from this day I shall be , Venus , let me never see .</s>

<s>no good can come of contemplating the sad , inevitable fact that once youth has passed a worse and worse time still succeeds the former .</s>

<s>but there are at least two reasons for contemplating one's mind in even a cracked mirror .</s>

<s>one is that there sometimes are real although inadequate compensations in growing old .</s>

<s>serenity , if one is fortunate enough to achieve it , is not so good as joy , but it is something .</s>

<s>even to be from hope and fear set free is at least better than to have lost the first without having got rid of the second .</s>

<s>the other reason ( and the one with which I am here concerned ) is that one thus becomes inclined to inquire of any opinion , or change of opinion , whether it represents the wisdom of experience or is only the result of the difference between youth and age which is as inevitable as the all too obvious physical differences .</s>

<s>one may be exasperatingly aware that if the answer is favorable it will be judged such only by those of one's own age .</s>

<s>but at least the question has been raised .</s>

<s>many readers of this department no doubt discount certain of my opinions for the simple reason that they can guess pretty accurately , even if they have never actually been told , what my age is .</s>

<s>at least I should like them to know that I know these discounts are being made .</s>

<s>let me then ( and in public ) glance into the mirror .</s>

<s>I have known some men and women who said that the selves they are told about or even remember seem utter strangers to them now ;
that their remote past is as discontinuous with their present selves , as lacking in any conscious likeness to their mature personality , as the self of a butterfly may be imagined discontinuous with that of the caterpillar it once was .</s>

<s>for my part I find it difficult to conceive such a state of affairs .</s>

<s>I have changed and I have reversed opinions ;
but I am so aware of an uninterrupted continuity of the persona or ego that I see only as absurd the tendency of some psychologists from Heraclitus to Pirandello and Proust to regard consciousness as no more than a flux amid which nothing remains unchanged .</s>

<s>so far as I am concerned , the child is unmistakably father to the man , despite the obvious fact that child and father differ greatly -- sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse .</s>

<s>fundamental values , temperament and the way in which one approaches a conviction change less , of course , than specific opinions .</s>

<s>that fact is very clearly illustrated in the case of the many present-day intellectuals who were Communists or near-Communists in their youth and are now so extremely conservative ( or reactionary , as many would say ) that they can define no important political conviction that does not seem so far from even a centrist position as to make the distinction between Mr. Nixon and Mr. Khrushchev for them hardly worth noting .</s>

<s>but in ways more fundamental than specific political opinions they are still what they always were : passionate , sure without a shadow of doubt of whatever it is that they are sure of , capable of seeing black and white only and , therefore , committed to the logical extreme of whatever it is they are temporarily committed to .</s>

<s>to those of my readers who find many of my opinions morally , or politically , or sociologically antiquated ( and I have reason to know that there are some such ) , I would like to say what I have already hinted , namely , that some of my opinions may indeed be subject to some discount on the simple ground that I am no longer young and therefore incapable of being youthful of mind .</s>

<s>but I will also remind them that I have always been inclined to skepticism , to a kind of Laodicean lack of commitment so far as public affairs are concerned ;
so that , although not as eager as I once was to be disapproved of , I can still resist prevailing opinions .</s>

<s>at about the age of twelve I became a Spencerian liberal , and I have always considered myself a liberal of some kind even though the definition has changed repeatedly since Spencer became a reactionary .</s>

<s>several times in my youth I voted the Socialist ticket , but less because I was Socialist than because I was not either a Republican or a Democrat , and I voted for Franklin Roosevelt every time he was a candidate .</s>

<s>yet during the years when I was on the staff of The Nation , I tried to the limit the patience of the editors on almost every occasion when I was permitted to write an editorial having a bearing on a political or social question .</s>

<s>never once during the trying thirties did I come so close to succumbing to the private climate of opinion as to grant Russian communism even that most weasel-worded of encomiums an interesting experiment .</s>

<s>there are few things of which I am prouder than of that unblemished record .</s>

<s>many of my friends at the time thought that I had received a well-deserved condemnation when Lincoln Steffens denounced me in a review of one of my books as a perfect example of the obsolete man who could understand and sympathize only with the dead past .</s>

<s>but he , as I can now retort , was the man who could see so short a distance ahead that after a visit to Russia he gave voice to the famous exclamation : I have seen the future and it works .</s>

<s>the favorite excuse of those who have now recanted their approval of communism is that they did not know how things would develop .</s>

<s>with this excuse I have never been much impressed .</s>

<s>there was , it seems to me , enough in the openly declared principles and intentions of Russian leaders to alienate honorable men without their having to wait to see how it would turn out .</s>

<s>once many years ago I sat at dinner next to Arthur Train , and the subject of The Nation came up .</s>

<s>he asked me suddenly , what are your political opinions ?</s>

<s>well , I replied , some of my colleagues on the paper regard me as a rank reactionary .</s>

<s>after a moment's thought he replied , that still leaves you a lot of latitude .</s>

<s>and I suppose it did .</s>

<s>I never have been , and am not now , any kind of utopian .</s>

<s>when I first came across Samuel Johnson's pronouncement , the remedy for the ills of life is palliative rather than radical , it seemed to me to sum up the profoundest of political and social truths .</s>

<s>it will probably explain more of my attitudes toward society than any other phrase or principle could .</s>

<s>why did I choose to fill these pages in this particular issue with this mixture of rather tenuous reflections and autobiography ?</s>

<s>the reason is , I think , my awareness that my remarks last quarter on pacifism may well have served to confirm the opinion of some that my tendency to skepticism and dissent gets us nowhere , and that I am simply too old to hope .</s>

<s>I would , however , like to suggest that , wrong though I may be , the tendency to see dilemmas rather than solutions is one of which I have been a victim ever since I can remember , and therefore not merely a senile phenomenon .</s>

<s>I know that one must act .</s>

<s>but one need not always be sure that the action is either wise or conclusive .</s>

<s>apropos of what some would call cynicism , I remember an anecdote the source of which I forget .</s>

<s>it concerns a small-town minister who staged an impressive object lesson by confining a lion and a lamb together in the same cage outside his church door .</s>

<s>not only his parishioners , but the whole town and , ultimately , the whole county were enormously impressed by this object lesson .</s>

<s>one day he was visited by a delegation of would-be imitators who wanted to know his secret .</s>

<s>how on earth do you manage it ?</s>

<s>what is the trick ?</s>

<s>why , he replied , it is perfectly simple ;
there is no trick involved .</s>

<s>all you have to do is put in a fresh lamb from time to time .</s>

<s>cynical ?</s>

<s>blasphemous ?</s>

<s>not really , it seems to me .</s>

<s>the promise that the lion and the lamb will lie down together was given in the future tense .</s>

<s>it is not something that can be expected to happen now .</s>

<s>without really changing the general subject , I take this opportunity to confess that I am troubled by doubts , not only about pacifism , but also when asked to join in the protest against a law that most of those who consider themselves humane and liberal seem to regard as obviously barbarous ;
namely , the law that prescribes the death penalty for murder when there seem to be no extenuating circumstances .</s>

<s>it is not that I am unaware of the force of their strongest contention .</s>

<s>life , they say , should be regarded as sacred and , therefore , as something that neither an individual nor his society has a right to take away .</s>

<s>in fact I cannot imagine myself condemning a man to the noose or the electric chair if I had to take , as an individual , the responsibility for his death .</s>

<s>just as I know I would make a bad soldier even though I cannot sincerely call myself a pacifist , so too I would not be either a hangman by profession or , if I could avoid it , even a member of a hanging jury .</s>

<s>despite these facts the question :
should no murderer ever be executed ?</s>

<s>seems to me to create a dilemma not to be satisfactorily disposed of by a simple negative answer .</s>

<s>punishment of the wrongdoer , so liberals are inclined to say , can have only three possible justifications : revenge , reformation or deterrent example .</s>

<s>for here if anywhere in contemporary literature is a major effort to counterbalance Existentialism and restore some of its former lustre to the tarnished image of the species Man , or , as Malraux himself puts it , to make men conscious of the grandeur they ignore in themselves .</s>

<s>1 Andre Malraux's The Walnut Trees Of Altenburg was written in the early years of the second World War , during a period of enforced leisure when he was taken prisoner by the Germans after the fall of France .</s>

<s>the manuscript , presumably after being smuggled out of the country , was published in Switzerland in 1943 .</s>

<s>the work as it stands is not the entire book that Malraux wrote at that time -- it is only the first section of a three-part novel called La Lutte avec l'Ange ;
and this first section was somehow preserved ( there are always these annoying little mysteries about the actual facts of Malraux's life ) when the Gestapo destroyed the rest .</s>

<s>if we are to believe the list of titles printed in Malraux's latest book , La Metamorphose Des Dieux , Vol.</s>

<s>1 ( 1957 ) , he is still engaged in writing a large novel under his original title .</s>

<s>but as he remarks in his preface to The Walnut Trees , a novel can hardly ever be rewritten , and when this one appears in its final form , the form of the first part will no doubt be radically changed .</s>

<s>Malraux pretends , perhaps with a trifle too self-conscious a modesty , that his fragmentary work will accordingly appeal only to the curiosity of bibliophiles and to connoisseurs of what might have been .</s>

<s>even in its present form , however , the first part of Malraux's unrecoverable novel is among the greatest works of mid-twentieth century literature ;
and it should be far better known than it is .</s>

<s>the theme of The Walnut Trees Of Altenburg is most closely related to its immediate predecessor in Malraux's array of novels : Man's Hope ( 1937 ) .</s>

<s>this magnificent but greatly underestimated book , which bodies forth the very form and pressure of its time as no other comparable creation , has suffered severely from having been written about an historical event -- the Spanish Civil War -- that is still capable of fanning the smoldering fires of old political feuds .</s>

<s>even so apparently impartial a critic as W. H. Frohock has taken for granted that the book was originally intended as a piece of Loyalist propaganda ;
and has then gone on to argue , with unimpeachable consistency , that all the obviously non-propagandistic aspects of the book are simply inadvertent contradictions .</s>

<s>nothing , however , could be farther from the truth .</s>

<s>the whole purpose of Man's Hope is to portray the tragic dialectic between means and ends inherent in all organized political violence -- and even when such violence is a necessary and legitimate self-defense of liberty , justice and human dignity .</s>

<s>nowhere before in Malraux's pages have we met such impassioned defenders of a quality of man which transcends the realm of politics and even the realm of action altogether -- both the action of Malraux's early anarchist-adventurers like Perken and Garine , and the self-sacrificing action of dedicated Communists like Kyo Gisors and Katow in Man's Fate .</s>

<s>man engages only a small part of himself in an action says old Alvear the art-historian ;
and the more the action claims to be total , the smaller is the part of man engaged .</s>

<s>these lines never cease to haunt the book amidst all the exaltations of combat , and to make an appeal for a larger and more elemental human community than one based on the brutal necessities of war .</s>

<s>it is this larger theme of the quality of man , a quality that transcends the ideological and flows into the human , which now forms the pulsating heart of Malraux's artistic universe .</s>

<s>Malraux , to be sure , does not abandon the world of violence , combat and sudden death which has become his hallmark as a creative artist , and which is the only world , apparently , in which his imagination can flame into life .</s>

<s>The Walnut Trees Of Altenburg includes not one war but two , and throws in a Turkish revolution along with some guerrilla fighting in the desert for good measure .</s>

<s>but while war still serves as a catalyst for the values that Malraux wishes to express , these values are no longer linked with the triumph or defeat of any cause -- whether that of an individual assertion of the will-to-power , or a collective attempt to escape from the humiliation of oppression -- as their necessary condition .</s>

<s>on the contrary , the frenzy and furor of combat is only the sombre foil against which the sudden illuminations of the human flash forth with the piercing radiance of a Caravaggio .</s>

<s>2 The Walnut Trees Of Altenburg is composed in the form of a triptych , with the two small side panels framing and enclosing the main central episode of the novel .</s>

<s>this central episode consists of a series of staccato scenes set in the period from the beginning of the present century up to the first World War .</s>

<s>the framing scenes , on the other hand , both take place in the late Spring of 1940 , just at the moment of the defeat of France in the second great world conflict .</s>

<s>the narrator is an Alsatian serving with the French Army , and he has the same name ( Berger ) that Malraux himself was later to use in the Resistance ;
like Malraux he was also serving in the tank corps before being captured , and we learn as well that in civilian life he had been a writer .</s>

<s>these biographical analogies are obvious , and far too much time has been spent speculating on their possible implications .</s>

<s>much more important is to grasp the feelings of the narrator ( whose full name is never given ) as he becomes aware of the disorganized and bewildered mass of French prisoners clustered together in a temporary prison camp in and around the cathedral of Chartres .</s>

<s>for as his companions gradually dissolve back into a state of primitive confrontation with elemental necessity , as they lose all the appanage of their acquired culture , he is overcome by the feeling that he is at last being confronted with the essence of mankind .</s>

<s>as a writer , by what have I been obsessed these last ten years , if not by mankind ?</s>

<s>here I am face to face with the primeval stuff .</s>

<s>the intuition about mankind conveyed in these opening pages is of crucial importance for understanding the remainder of the text ;
and we must attend to it more closely than has usually been done .</s>

<s>what does the narrator see and what does he feel ?</s>

<s>a good many pages of the first section are taken up with an account of the dogged determination of the prisoners to write to their wives and families -- even when it becomes clear that the Germans are simply allowing the letters to blow away in the wind .</s>

<s>awkwardly and laboriously , in stiff , unemotional phrases , the soldiers continue to bridge the distance between themselves and those they love ;
they instinctively struggle to keep open a road to the future in their hearts .</s>

<s>and by a skillful and unobtrusive use of imagery ( the enclosure is called a Roman-camp stockade , the hastily erected lean-to is a Babylonian hovel , the men begin to look like Peruvian mummies and to acquire Gothic faces ) , Malraux projects a fresco of human endurance -- which is also the endurance of the human -- stretching backward into the dark abyss of time .</s>

<s>the narrator feels himself catching a glimpse of pre-history , learning of man's age-old familiarity with misfortune , as well as his equally age-old ingenuity , his secret faith in endurance , however crammed with catastrophes , the same faith perhaps as the cave-men used to have in the face of famine .</s>

<s>this new vision of man that the narrator acquires is also accompanied by a re-vision of his previous view .</s>

<s>I thought I knew more than my education had taught me , notes the narrator , because I had encountered the militant mobs of a political or religious faith .</s>

<s>is this not Malraux himself alluding to his own earlier infatuation with the ideological ?</s>

<s>but now he knows that an intellectual is not only a man to whom books are necessary , he is any man whose reasoning , however elementary it may be , affects and directs his life .</s>

<s>from this point of view the militant mobs of the past , stirred into action by one ideology or another , were all composed of intellectuals -- and this is not the level on which the essence of mankind can be discovered .</s>

<s>the men around him , observes the narrator , have been living from day to day for thousands of years .</s>

<s>the human is deeper than a mass ideology , certainly deeper than the isolated individual ;
and the narrator recalls the words of his father , Vincent Berger : it is not by any amount of scratching at the individual that one finally comes down to mankind .</s>

<s>the entire middle section of The Walnut Trees is taken up with the life of Vincent Berger himself , whose fragmentary notes on his encounters with mankind are now conveyed by his son .</s>

<s>he was not much older than myself , writes the narrator , when he began to feel the impact of that human mystery which now obsesses me , and which makes me begin , perhaps , to understand him .</s>

<s>for the figure of Vincent Berger Malraux has obviously drawn on his studies of T. E. Lawrence ( though Berger fights on the side of the Turks instead of against them ) , and like both Lawrence and Malraux himself he is a fervent admirer of Nietzsche .</s>

<s>a professor at the University of Constantinople , where his first course of lectures was on Nietzsche and the philosophy of action , Vincent Berger becomes head of the propaganda department of the German Embassy in Turkey .</s>

<s>as an Alsatian before the first World War he was of course of German nationality ;
but he quickly involves himself in the Young Turk revolutionary movement to such an extent that his own country begins to doubt his patriotism .</s>

<s>and , after becoming the right-hand man of Enver Pasha , he is sent by the latter to pave the way for a new Turkish Empire embracing the union of all Turks throughout Central Asia from Adrianople to the Chinese oases on the Silk Trade Route .</s>

<s>Vincent Berger's mission is a failure because the Ottoman nationalism on which Enver Pasha counted does not exist .</s>

<s>central Asia is sunk in a somnolence from which nothing can awaken it ;
and amid a dusty desolation in which nothing human any longer seemed to survive , Vincent Berger begins to dream of the Occident .</s>

<s>oh , for the green of Europe ]
trains whistling in the night , the rattle and clatter of cabs .</s>

<s>finally , after almost being beaten to death by a madman -- he could not fight back because madmen are sacred to Islam -- he throws up his mission and returns to Europe .</s>

<s>this has been his first encounter with mankind , and , although he has now become a legendary figure in the popular European press , it leaves him profoundly dissatisfied .</s>

<s>despite Berger's report , Enver Pasha refuses to surrender his dream of a Turkish Blood Alliance ;
and Vincent Berger learns that political ambition is more apt to hide than to reveal the truth about men .</s>

<s>but as he discovers shortly , on returning among intellectuals obsessed by le culte du moi , his experience of action had also taught him a more positive lesson .</s>

<s>for six years my father had had to do too much commanding and convincing , writes the narrator , not to understand that man begins with the other .</s>

<s>and when Vincent Berger returns to Europe , this first result of his encounters with mankind is considerably enriched and deepened by a crucial revelation .</s>

<s>for a dawning sense of illumination occurs in consequence of two events which , as so often in Malraux , suddenly confront a character with the existential question of the nature and value of human life .</s>

<s>one such event is the landing in Europe itself , when the mingled familiarity and strangeness of the Occident , after the blank immensities of Asia , shocks the returning traveller into a realization of the infinite possibilities of human life .</s>

<s>in a pessimistic assessment of the cold war , Eden declared : there must be much closer unity within the West before there can be effective negotiation with the East .</s>

<s>ordinary methods of diplomacy within the free world are inadequate , said the former Prime Minister .</s>

<s>something much more thorough is required .</s>

<s>citing the experience of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in World War 2 , Eden said that all would have been confusion and disarray without them .</s>

<s>this , he said , is exactly what has been happening between the politically free nations in the postwar world .</s>

<s>we need joint chiefs of a political general staff .</s>

<s>citing the advances of Communist power in recent years , Sir Anthony observed : this very grave state of affairs will continue until the free nations accept together the reality of the danger that confronts them and unite their policies and resources to meet it .</s>

<s>while I fully agree with Sir Anthony's contention , I think that we must carry the analysis farther , bearing in mind that while common peril may be the measure of our need , the existence or absence of a positive sense of community must be the measure of our capacity .</s>

<s>while it is hazardous to project the trend of history , it seems clear that a genuine community is painfully emerging in the Western world , particularly among the countries of Western Europe .</s>

<s>at the end of World War 2 , free Europe was ready for a new beginning .</s>

<s>the excesses of nationalism had brought down upon Europe a generation of tyranny and war , and a return to the old order of things seemed unthinkable .</s>

<s>under these conditions a new generation of Europeans began to discover the bonds of long association and shared values that for so long had been subordinated to nationalist xenophobia .</s>

<s>a slow and painful trend toward unification has taken hold , a trend which may at any time be arrested and reversed but which may also lead to a binding federation of Europe .</s>

<s>it may well be that the unification of Europe will prove inadequate , that the survival of free society will require nothing less than the confederation of the entire Western world .</s>

<s>the movement toward European unity has been expressed in two currents : federalism and functionalism , one looking to the constitution of a United States of Europe , the other building on wartime precedents of practical cooperation for the solution of specific problems .</s>

<s>thus far the advances made have been almost entirely along functional lines .</s>

<s>many factors contributed to the growth of the European movement .</s>

<s>in 1946 Sir Winston Churchill , who had spoken often of European union during the war , advocated the formation of a kind of United States of Europe .</s>

<s>had Churchill been returned to office in 1945 , it is just possible that Britain , instead of standing fearfully aloof , would have led Europe toward union .</s>

<s>in 1947 and 1948 the necessity of massive coordinated efforts to achieve economic recovery led to the formation of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation to supervise and coordinate the uses of American aid under the Marshall Plan .</s>

<s>the United States might well have exploited the opportunity provided by the European Recovery Program to push the hesitant European nations toward political federation as well as economic cooperation , but all proposals to this effect were rejected by the United States Government at the time .</s>

<s>another powerful factor in the European movement was the threat of Soviet aggression .</s>

<s>the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was followed immediately by the conclusion of the Brussels Treaty , a 50-year alliance among Britain , France and the Benelux countries .</s>

<s>and of course the Soviet threat was responsible for J , the grand alliance of the Atlantic nations .</s>

<s>new organs of unification proliferated in the decade following the conclusion of the J alliance .</s>

<s>in 1949 the Council of Europe came into existence , a purely consultative parliamentary body but the first organ of political rather than functional unity .</s>

<s>in 1952 , the European Coal and Steel Community was launched , placing the coal and steel production of France , West Germany , Italy and Benelux under a supranational High Authority .</s>

<s>for a time it appeared that a common European army might be created , but the project for a European Defense Community was rejected by the French National Assembly in 1954 .</s>

<s>in 1957 the social-economic approach to European integration was capped by the formation among the Six of a tariff-free European Common Market , and Euratom for cooperation in the development of atomic energy .</s>

<s>the overseas democracies have generally encouraged the European unification movement without seriously considering the wisdom of their own full participation in a broader Atlantic community .</s>

<s>the United States and Canada belong only to J and the new O.E.C.D.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>Britain until recently went along in some areas with all of the enthusiasm of the groom at a shotgun wedding .</s>

<s>in other areas it held back , pleading its Commonwealth bonds .</s>

<s>now Britain has decided to seek admission to the European Economic Community and it seems certain that she will be joined by some of her partners in the loose Free Trade Area of the Outer Seven .</s>

<s>besides its historical significance as a break with the centuries-old tradition of British insularity , Britain's move , if successful , will constitute an historic landmark of the first importance in the movement toward the unification of Europe and the Western world .</s>

<s>if a broader Atlantic community is to be formed -- and my own judgment is that it lies within the realm of both our needs and our capacity -- a ready nucleus of machinery is at hand in the J alliance .</s>

<s>the time is now ripe , indeed overdue , for the vigorous development of its non-military potentialities , for its development as an instrument of Atlantic community .</s>

<s>what is required is the full implementation of Article 2 of the Treaty , which provides : the Parties will contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening their free institutions , by bringing about a better understanding of the principles upon which these institutions are founded , and by promoting conditions of stability and well-being .</s>

<s>they will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage economic collaboration between any and all of them .</s>

<s>as Lester Pearson wrote in 1955 :
J cannot live on fear alone .</s>

<s>it cannot become the source of a real Atlantic community if it remains organized to deal only with the military threat which first brought it into being .</s>

<s>the problem of J is not one of machinery , of which there is an abundance , but of the will to use it .</s>

<s>the J Council is available as an executive agency , the Standing Group as a high military authority .</s>

<s>the unofficial Conference of Parliamentarians is available as a potential legislative authority .</s>

<s>this machinery will not become the instrument of an Atlantic community by fiat , but only when that community evolves from potentiality to reality .</s>

<s>the existence of a community is a state of mind -- a conviction that goals and values are widely shared , that effective communication is possible , that mutual trust is reasonably assured .</s>

<s>an equally promising avenue toward Atlantic community may lie through the development and expansion of the O.E.C.D.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>conceived as an organ of economic cooperation , there is no reason why O.E.C.D.</s>

<s>cannot evolve into a broader instrument of union if its members so desire .</s>

<s>indeed it might be a more appropriate vehicle than J for the development of a parliamentary organ of the Atlantic nations , because it could encompass all of the members of the Atlantic community including those , like Sweden and Switzerland , who are unwilling to be associated with an essentially military alliance like J .</s>

<s>underlying these hopes and prescriptions is a conviction that the nations of the North Atlantic area do indeed form a community , at least a potential community .</s>

<s>there is nothing new in this ;
what is new and compelling is that the West is now but one of several powerful civilizations , or systems , and that one or more of the others may pose a mortal danger to the West .</s>

<s>for centuries the North Atlantic nations dominated the world and as long as they did they could afford the luxury of fighting each other .</s>

<s>that time is now past and the Atlantic nations , if they are to survive , must develop a full-fledged community , and they must also look beyond the frontiers of Western civilization toward a world-wide concert of free nations .</s>

<s>6 the burden of these reflections is that a broader unity among the free nations is at the core of our needs .</s>

<s>and if we do not aspire to too much , it is also within our capacity .</s>

<s>a realistic balancing of the need for new forms of international organization on the one hand , and our capacity to achieve them on the other , must be approached through the concept of community .</s>

<s>history has demonstrated many times that concerts of nations based solely on the negative spur of common danger are unlikely to survive when the external danger ceases to be dramatically urgent .</s>

<s>only when a concert of nations rests on the positive foundations of shared goals and values is it likely to form a viable instrument of long-range policy .</s>

<s>it follows that the solution to the current disunity of the free nations is only to a very limited extent a matter of devising new machinery of consultation and coordination .</s>

<s>it is very much a matter of building the foundations of community .</s>

<s>it is for these reasons that proposals for a new world order , through radical overhaul of the United Nations or through some sort of world federation , are utterly fatuous .</s>

<s>in a recent book called World Peace Through World Law , two distinguished lawyers , Grenville Clark and Louis Sohn , call for just such an overhaul of the U.N. , basing their case on the world-wide fear of a nuclear holocaust .</s>

<s>I believe that these proposals , however meritorious in terms of world needs , go far beyond our capacity to realize them .</s>

<s>such proposals look to an apocalyptic act , a kind of Lockian social contract on a world-wide scale .</s>

<s>the defect of these proposals is in their attempt to outrun history and their assumption that because something may be desirable it is also possible .</s>

<s>a working concept of the organic evolution of community must lead us in a different direction .</s>

<s>the failures of the U.N. and of other international organs suggest that we have already gone beyond what was internationally feasible .</s>

<s>our problem , therefore , is to devise processes more modest in their aspirations , adjusted to the real world of sovereign nation states and diverse and hostile communities .</s>

<s>the history of the U.N. demonstrates that in a pluralistic world we must develop processes of influence and persuasion rather than coercion .</s>

<s>it is possible that international organization will ultimately supplant the multi-state system , but its proper function for the immediate future is to reform and supplement that system in order to render pluralism more compatible with an interdependent world .</s>

<s>new machinery of coordination should not be our primary objective in the foreseeable future -- though perhaps the political general staff of Western leaders proposed by Sir Anthony Eden would serve a useful purpose .</s>

<s>generally , however , there is an abundance of available machinery of coordination -- in J , in O.E.C.D.</s>

<s>, in the U.N. and elsewhere .</s>

<s>the trouble with this machinery is that it is not used and the reason that it is not used is the absence of a conscious sense of community among the free nations .</s>

<s>our proper objective , then , is the development of a new spirit , the realization of a potential community .</s>

<s>a concert of free nations should take its inspiration from the traditions of the nineteenth century Concert of Europe with its common values and accepted rules of the game .</s>

<s>constitutions of and by themselves mean little ;
the history of both the League of Nations and the United Nations demonstrates that .</s>

<s>but a powerful sense of community , even with little or no machinery , means a great deal .</s>

<s>that is the lesson of the nineteenth century .</s>

<s>a realistic concert of free nations might be expected to consist of an inner community of the North Atlantic nations and an outer community embracing much or all of the non-Communist world .</s>

<s>the recent experiments in the new poetry-and-jazz movement seen by some as part of the San Francisco Renaissance have been as popular as they are notorious .</s>

<s>it might well start a craze like swallowing goldfish or pee-wee golf , wrote Kenneth Rexroth in an explanatory note in the Evergreen Review , and he may have been right .</s>

<s>under the general heading poetry-and-jazz widely divergent experiments have been carried out .</s>

<s>Lawrence Ferlenghetti and Bruce Lippincott have concentrated on writing a new poetry for reading with jazz that is very closely related to both the musical forms of jazz , and the vocabulary of the musician .</s>

<s>even musicians themselves have taken to writing poetry .</s>

<s>( Judy Tristano now has poems as well as ballads written for her .
)</s>

<s>but the best known exploiters of the new medium are Kenneth Rexroth and Kenneth Patchen .</s>

<s>Rexroth and Patchen are far apart musically and poetically in their experiments .</s>

<s>Rexroth is a longtime jazz buff , a name-dropper of jazz heroes , and a student of traditional as well as modern jazz .</s>

<s>in San Francisco he has worked with Brew Moore , Charlie Mingus , and other swinging musicians of secure reputation , thus placing himself within established jazz traditions , in addition to being a part of the San Francisco School .</s>

<s>although Patchen has given previous evidence of an interest in jazz , the musical group that he works with , the Chamber Jazz Sextet , is often ignored by jazz critics .</s>

<s>( Downbeat did not mention the Los Angeles appearance of Patchen and the Sextet , although the engagement lasted over two months .
)</s>

<s>the stated goal of the J is the synthesis of jazz and serious music .</s>

<s>Patchen's musicians are outsiders in established jazz circles , and Patchen himself has remained outside the San Francisco poetry group , maintaining a self-imposed isolation , even though his conversion to poetry-and-jazz is not as extreme or as sudden as it may first appear .</s>

<s>he had read his poetry with musicians as early as 1951 , and his entire career has been characterized by radical experiments with the form and presentation of his poetry .</s>

<s>however , his subject matter and basic themes have remained surprisingly consistent , and these , together with certain key poetic images , may be traced through all his work , including the new jazz experiments .</s>

<s>from the beginning of his career , Patchen has adopted an anti-intellectual approach to poetry .</s>

<s>his first book , Before The Brave ( 1936 ) , is a collection of poems that are almost all Communistic , but after publication of this book he rejected Communism , and advocated a pacifistic anarchy , though retaining his revolutionary idiom .</s>

<s>he spoke for a proletariat that included all the lost and sick and hunted of the earth .</s>

<s>Patchen believes that the world is being destroyed by power-hungry and money-hungry people .</s>

<s>running counter to the destroying forces in the world are all the virtues that are innate in man , the capacity for love and brotherhood , the ability to appreciate beauty .</s>

<s>beauty as well as love is redemptive , and Patchen preaches a kind of moral salvation .</s>

<s>this salvation does not take the form of a Christian Heaven .</s>

<s>in Patchen's eyes , organized churches are as odious as organized governments , and Christian symbols , having been taken over by the moneyed classes , are now agents of corruption .</s>

<s>Patchen envisions a Dark Kingdom which stands above the waters as a sentinel warning man of danger from his own kind .</s>

<s>the Dark Kingdom sends Angels of Death and other fateful messengers down to us with stern tenderness .</s>

<s>actually Heaven and the Dark Kingdom overlap ;
they form two aspects of heavenly life after death .</s>

<s>Patchen has almost never used strict poetic forms ;
he has experimented instead with personal myth-making .</s>

<s>much of his earlier work was conceived in terms of a pseudo-anthropological myth reference , which is concerned with imaginary places and beings described in grandiloquent and travelogue-like language .</s>

<s>these early experiments were evidently not altogether satisfying to Patchen .</s>

<s>beginning in Cloth Of The Tempest ( 1943 ) he experimented in merging poetry and visual art , using drawings to carry long narrative segments of a story , as in Sleepers Awake , and constructing elaborate poems-in-drawing-and-type in which it is impossible to distinguish between the art and the poetry .</s>

<s>art makings or pseudo-anthropological myths did not meet all of Patchen's requirements for a poetic frame of reference .</s>

<s>many of his poems purported to be exactly contemporary and political ;
so during the period approximately from 1941 to 1946 , Patchen often used private detective stories as a myth reference , and the private eye as a myth hero .</s>

<s>speaking in terms of sociological stereotype , the private eye might appeal to the poet in search of a myth for many reasons .</s>

<s>the private detective ( at least in the minds of listeners and readers all over the country ) is an individual hero fighting injustice .</s>

<s>he is usually something of an underdog , he must battle the organized police force as well as recognized criminals .</s>

<s>the private detective must rely , as the Youngest Son or Trickster Hero does in primitive myth , on his wits .</s>

<s>the private detective is militant against injustice , a humorous and ironic explorer of the underworld ;
most important to Patchen , he was a non-literary hero , and very contemporary .</s>

<s>in 1945 , probably almost every American not only knew who Sam Spade was , but had some kind of emotional feeling about him .</s>

<s>in The Memoirs Of A Shy Pornographer ( 1945 ) Patchen exploited this national sentiment by making his hero , Albert Budd , a private detective .</s>

<s>but since 1945 , Sam Spade has undergone a metamorphosis ;
he has become Friday on Dragnet , a mouthpiece of arbitrary police authority .</s>

<s>he has , like so many other secular and religious culture symbols , gone over to the side of the ruling classes .</s>

<s>obviously , the private eye can have no more appeal for Patchen .</s>

<s>to fill the job of contemporary hero in 1955 , Patchen needed someone else .</s>

<s>it was logical that he would come up with the figure of the modern jazz musician .</s>

<s>the revolution in jazz that took place around 1949 , the evolution from the bebop school of Dizzy Gillespie to the cool sound of Miles Davis and Lennie Tristano , Lee Konitz , and the whole legend of Charlie Parker , had made an impression on many academic and literary men .</s>

<s>the differentiation between the East Coast and West Coast schools of jazz , the differences between the hard bop school of Rollins , and the cerebral experiments of Tristano , Konitz and Marsh , the general differences in the mores of white and Negro musicians , all had become fairly well known to certain segments of the public .</s>

<s>the immense amount of interest that the new jazz had for the younger generation must have impressed him , and he began working toward the merger of jazz and poetry , as he had previously attempted the union of graphic art and poetry .</s>

<s>in addition to his experiments in reading poetry to jazz , Patchen is beginning to use the figure of the modern jazz musician as a myth hero in the same way he used the figure of the private detective a decade ago .</s>

<s>in this respect , his approach to poetry-and-jazz is in marked contrast to Kenneth Rexroth's .</s>

<s>Rexroth uses many of his early poems when he reads to jazz , including many of his Chinese and Japanese translations ;
he usually draws some kind of comparison with the jazz tradition and the poem he is reading -- for instance , he draws the parallel between a poem he reads about an Oriental courtesan waiting for the man she loves , and who never comes , and the old blues chants of Ma Rainy and other Negro singers -- but usually the comparison is specious .</s>

<s>Rexroth may sometimes achieve an effective juxtaposition , but he rarely makes any effort to capture any jazz feeling in the text of his poems , relying on his very competent musicians to supply this feeling .</s>

<s>Patchen does read some of his earlier works to music , but he has written an entire book of short poems which seem to be especially suited for reading with jazz .</s>

<s>these new poems have only a few direct references to jazz and jazz musicians , but they show changes in Patchen's approach to his poetry , for he has tried to enter into and understand the emotional attitude of the jazz musician .</s>

<s>it is difficult to draw the line between stereotype and the reality of the jazz musician .</s>

<s>everyone knows that private detectives in real life are not like Sam Spade and Pat Novak , but the real and the imaginary musician are closely linked .</s>

<s>seen by the public , the musician is the underdog par excellence .</s>

<s>he is forced to play for little money , and must often take another job to live .</s>

<s>his approach to music is highly individualistic ;
the accent is on improvisation rather than arrangements .</s>

<s>while he is worldly , the musician often cultivates public attitudes of childlike astonishment and naivete .</s>

<s>the musician is non-intellectual and non-verbal ;
he is far from being a literary hero , yet is a creative artist .</s>

<s>many of these aspects will be seen as comparable to those of the ideal detective , but where the detective is active and militant , the jazz musician is passive , almost a victim of society .</s>

<s>in order to write with authority either about musicians , or as a musician , Patchen would have to soft pedal his characteristically outspoken anger , and change ( at least for the purposes of this poetry ) from a revolutionary to a victim .</s>

<s>he must become one who knows all about the injustice in the world , but who declines doing anything about it .</s>

<s>this involves a shift in Patchen's attitude and it is a first step toward writing a new jazz poetry .</s>

<s>he has shown considerable ingenuity in adapting his earliest symbols and devices to the new work , and the fact that he has kept a body of constant symbols through all of his experiments gives an unexpected continuity to his poetry .</s>

<s>perhaps tracing some of these more important symbols through the body of his work will show that Patchen's new poetry is well thought out , and remains within the mainstream of his work , while being suited to a new form .</s>

<s>Henry Miller characterized Patchen as a man of anger and light .</s>

<s>his revolutionary anger is apparent in most of his early poems .</s>

<s>the following passage from The Hangman's Great Hands illustrates the directness of this anger .</s>

<s>anger won't help .</s>

<s>I was born angry .</s>

<s>angry that my father was being burnt alive in the mills ;
angry that none of us knew anything but filth and poverty .</s>

<s>angry because I was that very one somebody was supposed to be fighting for .</s>

<s>this angry and exasperated stance which Patchen has maintained in his poetry for almost fifteen years has been successfully modulated into a kind of woe that is as effective as anger and still expresses his disapproval of the modern world .</s>

<s>in his recent book , Hurray For Anything ( 1957 ) , one of the most important short poems -- and it is the title poem for one of the long jazz arrangements -- is written for recital with jazz .</s>

<s>although it does not follow the metrical rules for a blues to be sung , the phrases themselves carry a blues feeling .</s>

<s>I went to the city and there I did weep , men a-crowing like asses , and living like sheep .</s>

<s>oh , can't hold the han' of my love ]
can't hold her little white han' ]
yes , I went to the city , and there I did bitterly cry , men out of touch with the earth , and with never a glance at the sky .</s>

<s>oh , can't hold the han' of my love ]
can't hold her pure little han' ]
Patchen is still the rebel , but he writes in a doleful , mournful tone .</s>

<s>neither of these poems is an aberration ;
each is so typical that it represents a prominent trend in the poet's development .</s>

<s>Patchen is repeatedly preoccupied with death .</s>

<s>in many of his poems , death comes by train : a strongly evocative visual image .</s>

<s>perhaps Patchen was once involved in a train accident , and this passage from First Will And Testament may have been how the accident appeared to the poet when he first saw it -- if he did : Lord , love us , look at all the disconnected limbs floating hereabouts , like bloody feathers at that -- and all the eyes are talking and all the hair are moving and all the tongue are in all the cheek .</s>

<s>let us see just how typical Krim is .</s>

<s>he is New York-born and Jewish .</s>

<s>he spent one year at the University of North Carolina because Thomas Wolfe went there .</s>

<s>he returned to New York to work for The New Yorker , to edit a Western pulp , to duck the war in the J , to write publicity for Paramount Pictures and commentary for a newsreel , then he began his career as critic for various magazines .</s>

<s>now he has abandoned all that to be A Writer .</s>

<s>I do not want to quibble about typicality ;
in a certain sense , one manner of experience will be typical of any given group while another will not .</s>

<s>but I've got news for Krim : he's not typical , he's pretty special .</s>

<s>his may typify a certain kind of postwar New York experience , but his experience is certainly not typical of his generation's .</s>

<s>in any case , who ever thought that New York is typical of anything ?</s>

<s>men of Krim's age , aspirations , and level of sophistication were typically involved in politics before the war .</s>

<s>they did not duck the war but they fought in it , however reluctantly ;
they sweated out some kind of formal education ;
they read widely and eclectically ;
they did not fall into pseudo-glamorous jobs on pseudo-glamorous magazines , but they did whatever nasty thing they could get in order to eat ;
they found out who they were and what they could do , then within the limits of their talent they did it .</s>

<s>they did not worry about experience , because experience thrust itself upon them .</s>

<s>and they traveled out of New York .</s>

<s>only a native New Yorker could believe that New York is now or ever was a literary center .</s>

<s>it is a publishing and public relations center , but these very facts prevent it from being a literary center because writers dislike provincialism and untruth .</s>

<s>Krim's typicality consists only in his New Yorker's view that New York is the world ;
he displays what outlanders call the New York mind , a state that the subject is necessarily unable to perceive in himself .</s>

<s>the New York mind is two parts abstraction and one part misinformation about the rest of the country and in fact the world .</s>

<s>in his fulminating against the literary world , Krim is really struggling with the New Yorker in himself , but it's a losing battle .</s>

<s>closely related to his illusions about his typicality is Krim's complicated feeling about his Jewishness .</s>

<s>he writes , most of my friends and I were Jewish ;
we were also literary ;
the combination of the Jewish intellectual tradition and the sensibility needed to be a writer created in my circle the most potent and incredible intellectual-literary ambition I have ever seen or could ever have imagined .</s>

<s>within themselves , just as people , my friends were often tortured and unappeasably bitter about being the offspring of this unhappily unique-ingrown-screwedup breed ;
their reading and thinking gave an extension to their normal blushes about appearing Jewish in subway , bus , racetrack , movie house , any of the public places that used to make the Jew of my generation self-conscious ( heavy thinkers walking across Seventh Avenue without their glasses on , willing to dare the trucks as long as they didn't look like the ikey-kikey caricature of the Yiddish intellectual ) .</s>

<s>at other points in his narrative , Krim associates Jewishness with unappeasable literary ambition , with abstraction , with his personal turning aside from the good , the true , and the beautiful of fiction in the manner of James T. Farrell to the international , the false , and the inflated .</s>

<s>Krim says , in short , that he is a suffering Jew .</s>

<s>the only possible answer to that is , I am a suffering Franco-Irishman .</s>

<s>we all love to suffer , but some of us love to suffer more than others .</s>

<s>had Krim gone farther from New York than Chapel Hill , he might have discovered that large numbers of American Jews do not find his New York version of the Jews' lot remotely recognizable .</s>

<s>more important is the simple human point that all men suffer , and that it is a kind of anthropological-religious pride on the part of the Jew to believe that his suffering is more poignant than mine or anyone else's .</s>

<s>this is not to deny the existence of pogroms and ghettos , but only to assert that these horrors have had an effect on the nerves of people who did not experience them , that among the various side effects is the local hysteria of Jewish writers and intellectuals who cry out from confusion , which they call oppression and pain .</s>

<s>in their stupidity and arrogance they believe they are called upon to remind the gentile continually of pogroms and ghettos .</s>

<s>some of us have imagination and sensibility too .</s>

<s>finally , there is the undeniable fact that some of the finest American fiction is being written by Jews , but it is not Jewish fiction ;
Saul Bellow and Bernard Malamud , through intellectual toughness , perception , through experience in fact , have obviously liberated themselves from any sentimental Krim self-indulgence they might have been tempted to .</s>

<s>Krim's main attack is upon the aesthetic and the publishing apparatus of American literary culture in our day .</s>

<s>Krim was able to get an advance for a novel , and time and opportunity to write at Yaddo , but it was no good .</s>

<s>I had natural sock , he says , as a storyteller and was precociously good at description , dialogue , and most of the other staples of the fiction-writer's trade but I was bugged by a mammoth complex of thoughts and feelings that prevented me from doing more than just diddling the surface of sustained fiction-writing .</s>

<s>and again , how can you write when you haven't yet read Bartleby The Scrivener ?</s>

<s>Krim came to believe that the novel as a form had outlived its vital meaning .</s>

<s>his articulate Jewish friends convinced him that education ( read reading ) was a must .</s>

<s>he moved in a highly intellectual group in Greenwich Village in the late forties , becoming internationalized overnight .</s>

<s>then followed a period in which he wrote reviews for The New York Times Book Review , The Commonweal , Commentary , had a small piece in Partisan Review , and moved on to Hudson , The Village Voice , and Exodus .</s>

<s>the work for Commonweal was more satisfying than work for Commentary because of the staff's tiptoeing fear of making a booboo .</s>

<s>Commentary was a mere suburb of Partisan Review , the arch-enemy .</s>

<s>both magazines were rigid with reactionary fear .</s>

<s>Partisan has failed , Krim says , for being snob-clannish , overcerebral , Europeanish , aristocratically alienated from the U.S. .</s>

<s>it was the creation of a monstrous historical period wherein it thought it had to synthesize literature and politics and avant-garde art of every kind with its writers crazily trying to outdo each other in Spenglerian inclusiveness .</s>

<s>Kenyon , Sewanee , and Hudson operated in an Anglo-Protestant New Critical chill ;
their example caused Krim and his friends to put on Englishy airs , affect all sorts of impressive scholarship and social-register unnaturalness in order to slip through their narrow transoms and get into their pages .</s>

<s>qui s'excuse s'accuse , as the French Jewish intellectuals used to say .</s>

<s>through all this raving , Krim is performing a traditional and by now boring rite , the attack on intelligence , upon the largely successful attempt of the magazines he castigates to liberate American writing from local color and other varieties of romantic corn .</s>

<s>God knows that Partisan and the rest often were , and remain , guilty of intellectual flatulence .</s>

<s>sociological jargon , Germano-Slavic approximations to English , third-rate but modish fiction , and outrages to common sense have often disfigured Partisan , and in lesser degree , the other magazines on the list .</s>

<s>what Krim ignores , in his contempt for history and for accuracy , is that these magazines , Partisan foremost , brought about a genuine revolution in the American mind from the mid-thirties to approximately 1950 .</s>

<s>the most obvious characteristic of contemporary American writing , apart from the beat nonsense , is its cosmopolitanism .</s>

<s>the process of cosmopolitanism had begun in earnest about 1912 , but the First War and the depression virtually stalled that process in its tracks .</s>

<s>without the good magazines , without their book reviews , their hospitality to European writers , without above all their awareness of literary standards , we might very well have had a generation of Krim's heroes -- Wolfes , Farrells , Dreisers , and I might add , Sandburgs and Frosts and MacLeishes in verse -- and then where would we be ?</s>

<s>screwed , stewed , and tattooed , as Krim might say after reading a book about sailors .</s>

<s>when Partisan and Kenyon set up shop , Mencken was still accepted as an arbiter of taste ( remember Hergesheimer ?
)</s>

<s>, George Jean Nathan and Alexander Woollcott were honored in odd quarters , and the whole Booth Tarkington , Willa Catheter ( sic , ) Pearl Buck , Amy Lowell , William Lyon Phelps atmosphere lay thick as Los Angeles smog over the country .</s>

<s>politics , economics , sociology -- the entire area of life that lies between literature and what Krim calls experience -- urgently needed to be dug into .</s>

<s>the universities certainly were not doing it , nor were the popular magazines of the day .</s>

<s>this Partisan above all did ;
if it had never printed a word of literature its contribution to the politico-sociological area would still be historic .</s>

<s>but it did print good verse and good fiction .</s>

<s>if the editors sometimes dozed and printed pretentious , New York-mind dross , they also printed Malraux , Silone , Chiaromonte , Gide , Bellow , Robert Lowell , Francis Fergusson , Mary McCarthy , Delmore Schwartz , Mailer , Elizabeth Hardwick , Eleanor Clark , and a host of other good writers .</s>

<s>Partisan Review and the other literary magazines helped to educate , in the best sense , an entire generation .</s>

<s>that these magazines also deluded the Krims of the world is unfortunate but inevitable .</s>

<s>it is a fact of life that magazines are edited by groups : they have to be or they wouldn't be published at all .</s>

<s>and it is also a fact of life that there will always be youngish half-educated people around who will be dazzled by the glitter of what looks like a literary movement .</s>

<s>( there are no literary movements , there are only writers doing their work .</s>

<s>literary movements are the creation of pimps who live off writers .
)</s>

<s>when Krim says mine was as severe a critical-intellectual environment as can be imagined , he is off his rocker .</s>

<s>he indicates that he has none of the disciplines that criticism requires , including education ;
the result was his inevitable bedazzlement through ignorance .</s>

<s>he wasn't being educated in those Village bull-sessions , as he claims .</s>

<s>no one was ever educated through bull-sessions in anything other than , to quote him again , perfumed bullshit .</s>

<s>only a New York hick would expect to find the literary life in Greenwich Village at any point later than Walt Whitman's day .</s>

<s>the highly intellectual minds that Krim says he encountered in the Village did their work in spite of , not because of , any Village atmosphere .</s>

<s>but Krim's complaint is important because not only in New York , but in other cities and in universities throughout this country , young and not so young men at this moment are being bedazzled by half-digested ideas .</s>

<s>those who have quality will outgrow the experience ;
the rest will turn beat , or into dentists , or into beat dentists .</s>

<s>for the sad truth is that while one might write well without having read Bartleby The Scrivener , one is more likely to write well if one has read it , and much else .</s>

<s>the most appalling aspect of Krim's piece is his reflection of the beat aesthetic .</s>

<s>he mentions the beats only once , when he refers to their having revived through mere power and abandonment and the unwillingness to commit death in life some idea of a decent equivalent between verbal expression and actual experience , but the entire narrative is written in the tiresome vocabulary of that lost and dying cause , and in the sprung syntax that is supposed to supplant our mother tongue .</s>

<s>Krim's aesthetic combines anti-intellectualism , conscious and unconscious naivete , and a winsome reliance upon the natural and upon experience .</s>

<s>ideas are the thruway to nowhere .</s>

<s>my touchstones had been strictly literature and , humanly enough , American literature ( because that was what I wanted to write ) .</s>

<s>he alludes to something called direct writing , and he finds that criticism gets in the way of his truer , realer , imaginative bounce .</s>

<s>there had been signs and portents like the regular toppling over and defacing of the bust of Lauro Di Bosis near the Villa Lante and in the Gianicolo .</s>

<s>something was happening all right , slowly it is true , but you could feel it .</s>

<s>the Italians felt it .</s>

<s>little things .</s>

<s>an Italian poet had noticed plainclothes policemen lounging around the area of Quirinal Palace , the first time since the war .</s>

<s>at least they hadn't stepped up and asked to see papers in the hated , flat , dialect mispronunciation of Mussolini's home district -- dogumenti , per favore .</s>

<s>but , who knew , that might be coming one of these days .</s>

<s>there were other Italians who still bore scars they had earned in police station basements , resisting .</s>

<s>they laughed and , true to national form and manners , never talked long or solemnly on any subject at all , but some of them worried out loud about short memories and ghosts .</s>

<s>we saw Giuseppe Berto at a party once in a while , tall , lean , nervous and handsome , and , in our opinion , the best novelist of them all except Pavese , and Pavese is dead .</s>

<s>Berto's The Sky Is Red had been a small masterpiece and in its special way the best book to come out of the war .</s>

<s>now he was married to a beautiful girl , had a small son , and lived in an expensive apartment and worked for the movies .</s>

<s>on his desk was a slowly accumulating treatment and script of The Count Of Monte Cristo .</s>

<s>on his bookshelves were some of the latest American novels , including Bellow's Seize The Day , but he hadn't read them ( they were sent by American publishers ) and wasn't especially interested in what the American writers were up to .</s>

<s>he was interested in Robert Musil's The Man Without Qualities .</s>

<s>so were a lot of other people .</s>

<s>he was interested in Italo Svevo .</s>

<s>he was thinking his way into a new novel , a big one , one that people had been waiting for .</s>

<s>it was going to be hard going all the way because he hadn't written seriously for a while , except for a few stories , was tired of the old method of realismo he had so successfully used in The Sky Is Red .</s>

<s>this one was going to be different .</s>

<s>he had bought a little piece of property down along the coast of the hard country of Calabria that he knew so well .</s>

<s>he was going to do one or two more films for cash and then chuck it all , leave Rome and its intellectual cliques and money-fed life , go back to Calabria .</s>

<s>Berto seemed worried , too .</s>

<s>he knew all about it and had put it down in journal form in The War In A Black Shirt , a wonderful book not , for some strange reason , published in the U.S. .</s>

<s>he knew all about the appeal of a black shirt and jackboots to a poor , southern , peasant boy .</s>

<s>he knew all about the infection and the fever , and , too , the moment of realization when he saw for himself , threw up his hands and quit , ended the war as a prisoner in Texas .</s>

<s>Berto knew all about Fascism .</s>

<s>so did his friend , the young novelist Rimanelli .</s>

<s>Rimanelli is tough and square-built and adventurous , says what he thinks .</s>

<s>he had put it down in a war novel , The Day Of The Lion .</s>

<s>these people were not talking much about it , but you , a foreigner , sensed their apprehension and disappointment .</s>

<s>so there we were talking around and about it .</s>

<s>the English lady said she had to go to Vienna for a while .</s>

<s>it was a pity because she had planned to lay a wreath at the foot of the Garibaldi statue , towering over Rome in spectacular benediction from the highpoint of the Gianicolo .</s>

<s>around that statue in the green park where children play and lovers walk in twos and there is a glowing view of the whole city , in that park are the rows of marble busts of Garibaldi's fallen men , the ones who one day rushed out of the Porta San Pancrazio and , under fire all the way , up the long , straight narrow lane to take , then lose the high ground of the Villa Doria Pamphili .</s>

<s>when they lost it , the French artillery moved in , and that was the end for Garibaldi that time , on 30 April 1849 .</s>

<s>once out of the gate they had charged straight up the narrow lane .</s>

<s>we had walked it many times and shivered , figuring what a fish barrel it had been for the French .</s>

<s>now the park is filled with marble busts and all the streets in the immediate area have the full and proper names of the men who fell .</s>

<s>we were at a party once and heard an idealistic young European call that awful charge glorious .</s>

<s>our companion was a huge , plain-spoken American sculptor who had been a sixteen-year-old rifleman all across France in 1944 .</s>

<s>he said it was stupid butchery to order men to make a charge like that , no matter who gave the order and what for .</s>

<s>oh , it would be butchery all right , the European said .</s>

<s>we would see it that way , but it was glorious then .</s>

<s>it was the last time in history anybody could do something gloriously like that .</s>

<s>I thought : who is older now ?</s>

<s>old world and new world .</s>

<s>the sculptor looked at him , bugeyed and amazed , angry .</s>

<s>he had made an assault once with 180 men .</s>

<s>it was a picked assault company .</s>

<s>they went up against an J unit of comparable size , over a little rise of ground , over an open field .</s>

<s>object -- a village crossroads .</s>

<s>they made it , killed every last one of the Krauts , took the village on schedule .</s>

<s>when it was over , eight of his company were still alive and all eight were wounded .</s>

<s>the whole thing , from the moment when they jumped heavily off the trucks , spread out and moved into position just behind the cover of that slight rise of ground and then jumped off , took maybe between twenty and thirty minutes .</s>

<s>the sculptor looked at him , let the color drain out of his face , grinned , and looked down into his drink , a bad Martini made with raw Italian gin .</s>

<s>bullshit , he said softly .</s>

<s>excuse me , the European said .</s>

<s>I am not familiar with the expression .</s>

<s>the apartment where we were talking that afternoon in March faced onto the street Garibaldi's men had charged up and along .</s>

<s>across the way from the apartment building is a ruined house , shot to hell that day in 1849 , and left that way as a memorial .</s>

<s>there is a bronze wreath on the wall .</s>

<s>like everything else in Rome , ruins and monuments alike , that house is lived in .</s>

<s>I have seen diapers strung across the ruined roof .</s>

<s>the English lady really wanted to put a wreath on the Garibaldi monument on the 30th of April .</s>

<s>she had her reasons for this .</s>

<s>for one thing , there wasn't going to be any ceremony at all this year .</s>

<s>there were a few reasons for that , too : Garibaldi had been taken up and exploited by the Communists nowadays .</s>

<s>therefore the government wanted no part of him .</s>

<s>( it is sort of as if our government should decide to disown Washington or Lincoln for the same reason .
)</s>

<s>and then there were ecclesiastical matters , the matter of Garibaldi's anti-clericalism .</s>

<s>there was a new Pope and the Vatican was making itself heard and felt these days .</s>

<s>as it happens the English lady is a good Catholic herself , but of more liberal political persuasion .</s>

<s>nothing was going to be done this year to celebrate Garibaldi's bold and unsuccessful defense of Rome .</s>

<s>all that the English lady wanted to do was to walk up to the monument and lay a wreath at its base .</s>

<s>this would show that somebody , even a foreigner living in Rome , cared .</s>

<s>and then there were other things .</s>

<s>some of the marble busts in the park are of young Englishmen who fought and died for Garibaldi .</s>

<s>she also mentioned leaving a little bunch of flowers at the bust of Lauro Di Bosis .</s>

<s>it is hard for me to know how I feel about Lauro Di Bosis .</s>

<s>I suffer from mixed feelings .</s>

<s>he was a well-to-do , handsome , and sensitive young poet .</s>

<s>his bust shows an intense , mustached , fine-featured face .</s>

<s>he flew over Rome one day during the early days of Mussolini and scattered leaflets over the city , denouncing the Fascists .</s>

<s>he was never heard of again .</s>

<s>he is thought either to have been killed by the Fascists as soon as he landed or to have killed himself by flying out to sea and crashing his plane .</s>

<s>he was , thus , an early and spectacular victim .</s>

<s>and there is something so wonderfully romantic about it all .</s>

<s>he really didn't know how to fly .</s>

<s>he had crashed on takeoff once before .</s>

<s>gossip had it ( for gossip is the soul of Rome ) that a famous American dancer of the time had paid for both the planes .</s>

<s>it was absurd and dramatic .</s>

<s>it is remembered and has been commemorated by a bust in a park and a square in the city which was renamed Piazzo Lauro Di Bosis after the war .</s>

<s>most Romans , even some postmen , know it by the old name .</s>

<s>faced with a gesture like Di Bosis' , I find usually that my sentiments are closer to those of my sculptor friend .</s>

<s>the things that happened in police station basements were dirty , grubby , and most often anonymous .</s>

<s>no poetry , no airplanes , no dancers .</s>

<s>that is how the real routine of resistance goes on , and its strength is directly proportionate to the number of insignificant people who can let themselves be taken to pieces , piece by piece , without quitting .</s>

<s>it is an ugly business and there are few , if any , wreaths for them .</s>

<s>I keep thinking of a young woman I knew during the Occupation in Austria .</s>

<s>she was from Prague .</s>

<s>she had been picked up by the Russians , questioned in connection with some pamphlets , sentenced to life imprisonment for espionage .</s>

<s>she escaped , crawled through the usual mine fields , under barbed wire , was shot at , swam a river , and we finally picked her up in Linz .</s>

<s>she showed us what had happened to her .</s>

<s>no airplanes , no Nathan Hale statements .</s>

<s>just no spot , not even a dimesize spot , on her whole body that wasn't bruised , bruise on top of bruise , from beatings .</s>

<s>I understand very well about Lauro Di Bosis and how his action is symbolic .</s>

<s>the trouble is that like many symbols it doesn't seem a very realistic one .</s>

<s>the English lady wanted to pay tribute to Garibaldi and to Lauro Di Bosis , but she wasn't going to be here to do it .</s>

<s>were any of us interested enough in the idea to do it for her , by proxy so to speak ?</s>

<s>there was a pretty thorough silence at that point .</s>

<s>my spoon stirring coffee , banging against the side of the cup , sounded as loud as a bell .</s>

<s>I thought : what the hell ?</s>

<s>why not ?</s>

<s>I said I would do it for her .</s>

<s>I had some reasons , too .</s>

<s>I admire the English lady .</s>

<s>I hate embarrassing silences and have been known to make a fool out of myself just to prevent one .</s>

<s>I also had and have feelings about Garibaldi .</s>

<s>like every Southerner I can't escape the romantic tradition of brave defeats , forlorn lost causes .</s>

<s>though Garibaldi's fight was small shakes compared to Pickett's Charge -- which , like all Southerners , I view in almost Miltonic terms , fallen angels , etc.</s>

<s>-- I associated the two .</s>

<s>and to top it all I am often sentimental on purpose , trying to prove to myself that I am not afraid of sentiment .</s>

<s>so much for all that .</s>

<s>the English lady was pleased and enthusiastic .</s>

<s>she gave me the names of some people who would surely help pay for the flowers and might even march up to the monument with me .</s>

<s>the idea of the march pleased her .</s>

<s>maybe twenty , thirty , fifty .</s>

<s>maybe I could call Rimanelli at the magazine Rottosei where he worked .</s>

<s>the system is composed of three credit services , Federal Land Banks and National Farm Loan Associations , Federal Intermediate ( short-term ) Credit Banks , and Banks for Cooperatives .</s>

<s>this system provides long- and short-term credit to farmers and their cooperative marketing , purchasing , and business service organizations .</s>

<s>as a source of investment capital , the system is beneficial to local communities and encourages the development of industries in rural areas .</s>

<s>the credit provdied by the first two services in the system outlined above is primarily for general agricultural purposes .</s>

<s>the third credit service , Banks for Cooperatives , exists under authority of the Farm Credit Act of 1933 .</s>

<s>the Banks for Cooperatives were established to provide a permanent source of credit on a sound basis for farmers' cooperatives .</s>

<s>types of loans
three distinct classes of loans are made available to farmers' cooperatives by the Banks for Cooperatives : commodity loans , operating capital loans , and facility loans .</s>

<s>eligibility
to be eligible to borrow from a Bank for Cooperatives , a cooperative must be an association in which farmers act together in processing and marketing farm products , purchasing farm supplies , or furnishing farm business services , and must meet the requirements set forth in the Farm Credit Act of 1933 , as amended .</s>

<s>interest rates
interest rates are determined by the board of directors of the bank with the approval of the Farm Credit Administration .</s>

<s>minerals exploration
to encourage exploration for domestic sources of minerals , the Office of Minerals Exploration ( OME ) of the U.S. Department of the Interior offers financial assistance to firms and individuals who desire to explore their properties or claims for 1 or more of the 32 mineral commodities listed in the J regulations .</s>

<s>requirements
this help is offered to applicants who ordinarily would not undertake the exploration under present conditions or circumstances at their sole expense and who are unable to obtain funds from commercial sources on reasonable terms .</s>

<s>each applicant is required to own or have sufficient interest in the property to be explored .</s>

<s>the Government will contract with an eligible applicant to pay up to one-half of the cost of approved exploration work as it progresses .</s>

<s>the applicant pays the rest of the cost , but his own time spent on the work and charges for the use of equipment which he owns may be applied toward his share of the cost .</s>

<s>repayment
funds contributed by the Government are repaid by a royalty on production from the property .</s>

<s>if nothing is produced , there is no obligation to repay .</s>

<s>a 5-percent royalty is paid on any production during the period the contract is in effect ;
if the Government certifies that production may be possible from the property , the royalty obligation continues for the 10-year period usually specified in the contract or until the Government's contribution is repaid with interest .</s>

<s>the royalty applies to both principal and interest , but it never exceeds 5 percent .</s>

<s>in most of the less developed countries , however , such programing is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent .</s>

<s>only a very few of the more advanced ones , such as India and Pakistan , have developed systematic techniques of programing .</s>

<s>others have so-called development plans , but some of these are little more than lists of projects collected from various ministries while others are statements of goals without analysis of the actions required to attain them .</s>

<s>only rarely is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation .</s>

<s>we can help in the planning process .</s>

<s>neither growth nor a development program can be imposed on a country ;
it must express the nation's own will and goal .</s>

<s>nevertheless , we can administer an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing .</s>

<s>first , we can encourage responsibility by establishing as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs .</s>

<s>second , we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on the consistency of such projects with the program .</s>

<s>third , we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapted to the country's objectives and resources .</s>

<s>this includes assistance in -- assembling the basic economic , financial , technological , and educational information on which programing depends ;
surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad sectors of the economy , such as transport , agriculture , communication , industry , and power ;
designing the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation ;
and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of programs once established .</s>

<s>we must use common sense in applying conditions .</s>

<s>the application of conditions in the allocation of aid funds cannot , of course , be mechanical .</s>

<s>it must be recognized that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meeting such conditions .</s>

<s>to insist on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid growth .</s>

<s>in the more primitive areas , where the capacity to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited , some activities may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them before a well worked out program is available .</s>

<s>thus , we might provide limited assistance in such fields as education , essential transport , communications , and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country programs .</s>

<s>in such a case , however , we would encourage the recipient country to get on with its programing task , supply it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task , and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance to the country's development was conditional upon programing progress being made .</s>

<s>at the other end of the spectrum , where the more advanced countries can be relied upon to make well thought through decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program , we should be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward long-term support , in cooperation with other developed countries , of the essential foreign exchange requirements of the country's development program .</s>

<s>D .</s>

<s>encouraging self-help 1 .</s>

<s>the reasons for stressing self-help
a systematic approach to development budgeting and programing is one important kind of self-help .</s>

<s>there are many others .</s>

<s>it is vitally important that the new U.S. aid program should encourage all of them , since the main thrust for development must come from the less developed countries themselves .</s>

<s>external aid can only be marginal , although the margin , as in the case of the Marshall plan , can be decisive .</s>

<s>external aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help .</s>

<s>U.S. aid , therefore , should increasingly be designed to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take .</s>

<s>aid advice is not interference .</s>

<s>in establishing conditions of self-help , it is important that we not expect countries to remake themselves in our image .</s>

<s>open societies can take many forms , and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals .</s>

<s>on the other hand , it is no interference with sovereignty to point out defects where they exist , such as that a plan calls for factories without power to run them , or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them .</s>

<s>once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned with a country's development potential , we can be blunt in suggesting the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>the range of self-help
the major areas of self-help are the following : ( A ) the effective mobilizing of resources .</s>

<s>this includes not only development programing , but also establishing tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment ;
fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation ;
and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a few .</s>

<s>( B ) the reduction of dependence on external sources .</s>

<s>this includes foreseeing balance-of-payments crises , with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports .</s>

<s>it also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate projects after they are completed .</s>

<s>( C ) tapping the energies of the entire population .</s>

<s>for both economic and political reasons all segments of the population must be able to share in the growth of a country .</s>

<s>otherwise , development will not lead to longrun stability .</s>

<s>( D ) honesty in government .</s>

<s>in many societies , what we regard as corruption , favoritism , and personal influence are so accepted as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted but unfriendly .</s>

<s>yet an economy cannot get the most out of its resources if dishonesty , corruption , and favoritism are widespread .</s>

<s>moreover , tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion of aid resources and in the long run generates anti-American sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest .</s>

<s>some of the most dramatic successes of Communism in winning local support can be traced to the identification -- correct or not -- of Communist regimes with personal honesty and pro-Western regimes with corruption .</s>

<s>a requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically uncomfortable in the short run , but it is politically essential in the long run .</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>U.S. position on self-help
the United States can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by responding with aid on a sustained basis , tailored to priority needs , to those countries making serious efforts in self-help .</s>

<s>in many instances it can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such efforts .</s>

<s>there are other countries where , with skillful diplomacy , we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups in government which would like to press forward with economic and social reform measures to promote growth .</s>

<s>governments are rarely monolithic .</s>

<s>but there will be still other countries where , despite the inadequacy of the level of self-help , we shall deem it wise , for political or military reasons , to give substantial economic assistance .</s>

<s>even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to termination .</s>

<s>E .</s>

<s>encouraging a long-term approach 1 .</s>

<s>development requires a long-term approach .</s>

<s>the most fundamental concept of the new approach to economic aid is the focusing of our attention , our resources , and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and social development of the less developed countries .</s>

<s>this is not a short-run goal .</s>

<s>to have any success in this effort , we must ourselves view it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years , and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same fashion .</s>

<s>most of our aid will go to those nearing self-sufficiency .</s>

<s>how long it will take to show substantial success in this effort will vary greatly from country to country .</s>

<s>in several significant cases , such as India , a decade of concentrated effort can launch these countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance .</s>

<s>these cases in which light is already visible at the other end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb the bulk of our capital assistance .</s>

<s>gradually others will move up to the same level .</s>

<s>the number of countries thus favorably situated is small , but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the underdeveloped world .</s>

<s>meantime , over the decade of the sixties , we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into self-sustaining growth .</s>

<s>in still others which are barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity , the decade can bring significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded range of developmental activities is possible .</s>

<s>aid is a long-term process .</s>

<s>the whole program must be conceived of as an effort , stretching over a considerable number of years , to alter the basic social and economic conditions in the less developed world .</s>

<s>it must be recognized as a slow-acting tool designed to prevent political and military crises such as those recently confronted in Laos and Cuba .</s>

<s>it is not a tool for dealing with these crises after they have erupted .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>the specific reasons for a long-term approach ( A )
the need to budget a period of years .</s>

<s>many of the individual projects for which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy periods .</s>

<s>dams , river development schemes , transportation networks , educational systems require years to construct .</s>

<s>moreover , on complex projects , design work must be completed and orders for machinery and equipment placed months or .</s>

<s>the capital expansion programs of business firms involve multi-year budgeting and the same is true of country development programs .</s>

<s>( B ) the need to plan investment programs .</s>

<s>more importantly , several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more than that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities involved are all to take place in the proper sequence .</s>

<s>without such forward planning , investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities are completed before there is power to operate them or before there is transport to service them ;
or a skilled labor force is trained before there are plants available in which they can be employed .</s>

<s>( C ) the need to allocate country resources .</s>

<s>most important of all , the less developed countries must be persuaded to take the necessary steps to allocate and commit their own resources .</s>

<s>they must be induced to establish the necessary tax , fiscal , monetary , and regulatory policies .</s>

<s>they must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help measures which are described in the preceding section .</s>

<s>the taking of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions .</s>

<s>moreover , once these steps are taken , they may require years to make themselves felt .</s>

<s>they must , therefore , be related to long-range development plans .</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>providing an incentive
if the less developed countries are to be persuaded to adopt a long-term approach , the United States , as the principal supplier of external aid , must be prepared to give long-term commitments .</s>

<s>in this , as in so many aspects of our development assistance activities , the incentive effects of the posture we take are the most important ones .</s>

<s>the extent to which we can persuade the less developed countries to appraise their own resources , to set targets toward which they should be working , to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate attention , and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves , all on a realistic long-term basis , will depend importantly on the incentives we place before them .</s>

<s>if they feel that we are taking a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities , they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required .</s>

<s>perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we have responded with long-term commitments .</s>

<s>you have heard him tell these young people that during his almost 50 years of service in the Congress he has seen the Kaisers and the Hitlers and the Mussolinis , the Tojos and Stalins and Khrushchevs , come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest Nation that mankind has ever known .</s>

<s>then I have seen the pride of country well in the eyes of these young people .</s>

<s>so , I say , Mr. Speaker , God bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body but for the United States of America and the free world .</s>

<s>you remember the words of President Kennedy a week or so ago , when someone asked him when he was in Canada , and Dean Rusk was in Europe , and Vice President Johnson was in Asia , who is running the store ?</s>

<s>and he said , the same fellow who has been running it , Sam Rayburn .</s>

<s>general leave to extend Mr. McCormack

<s>Mr. Speaker , I ask unanimous consent that all Members who desire to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the record ;

<s>there was no objection .</s>

<s>remarks of Hon.</s>

<s>Joseph P. Addabbo of
New York Mr. Addabbo .</s>

<s>it is notably significant that so many Members from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for our beloved Speaker , the Honorable Sam Rayburn .</s>

<s>I purposely refrained from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from the State of Texas .</s>

<s>I did so because I agree with so many here today , that he is the beloved Speaker of all the people of the United States .</s>

<s>for the dignity , the influence , and the power of the legislative branch of our Government -- it is a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all the people of our country .</s>

<s>to honor him is to honor ourselves .</s>

<s>in this my first year as a Member of this body I have experienced many memorable moments .</s>

<s>many of these experiences are so important that they will be cherished forever by me .</s>

<s>and , like many of you here present , I hold as the highlight of all , the occasion of my first meeting with the honorable Speaker of the House .</s>

<s>at that time , he afforded me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as I may need , to speak about my background , my hopes , my views on various national and local topics , and any problems that I may have been vexed with at the time .</s>

<s>he was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me and tremendously wise in his counsel .</s>

<s>in conclusion , he wished me well -- and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express himself , he asked to be remembered to my wife and children .</s>

<s>in my short period here I believe that at no time has he been otherwise than the most popular man on both sides of the aisle .</s>

<s>he is most effective in the ordinary business of the House , and in the legislative accomplishments of this session , he easily rose to great occasion -- even at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle -- and as the Nation witnessed these contests , he rose , even as admitted by those who differed with him , to the proportions of a hero and a noble partisan .</s>

<s>I am highly privileged today to commemorate the brilliant career of this parliamentary giant .</s>

<s>he will ever be my example as a true statesman ;
one who is thoroughly human , who affects no dignity , and who is endowed with real ability , genuine worth , and sterling honesty -- all dedicated to secure the best interests of the country he has loved and served so long .</s>

<s>may the Divine Speaker in Heaven bless this country with Sam Rayburn's continued service here for years to come .</s>

<s>remarks of Hon.</s>

<s>Wayne L. Hays of Ohio Mr. Hays .</s>

<s>it is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues in this paean of praise , respect , and affection for Speaker Sam Rayburn .</s>

<s>in this hour of crisis , the wisdom , the dedication , the stabilizing force that he represents in current American government is an almost indispensable source of strength .</s>

<s>he has become in this half century the grand old man of American history .</s>

<s>it seems to me that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition to Providence that Sam Rayburn's vigor and his life remain undiminished through the coming decades .</s>

<s>here briefly in this humble tribute I have sought for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country .</s>

<s>but the task is beyond me because I hold it impossible to compress in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions Sam Rayburn has made as an individual , as a legislator , as a statesman and as a leader and conciliator , to the majestic progress of this Nation .</s>

<s>it happens that I am a legislator from Ohio and that I feel deeply about the needs , the aspirations , the interests of my district and my State .</s>

<s>what Sam Rayburn's life proves to us all is the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests of one's own community , one's own district , one's own State , and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of the problems of this the greatest nation of all time .</s>

<s>for Sam Rayburn never forgot Bonham , his home community , and he never forgot Texas .</s>

<s>in the same way I like to think we owe our loyalty as legislators to our community , our district , our State .</s>

<s>and , if we follow the Rayburn pattern , as consciously or by an instinctual political sense I like to think I have followed it , then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country .</s>

<s>for what Sam Rayburn's life in this House teaches us is that loyalty and character are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your country and neglecting your district .</s>

<s>there is no such thing as being diligent about national affairs but indifferent about home needs .</s>

<s>the two are as one .</s>

<s>this may not be the greatest but it certainly comes close to being the greatest lesson Sam Rayburn's career , up to this hour , teaches all of us who would aspire to distinction in political life under our processes of government .</s>

<s>more than that , Sam Rayburn is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition .</s>

<s>through the most rancorous battles of political controversy and the most bitterly fought national and presidential campaigns his character shines as an example of dignity and honesty , forthrightness and nobility .</s>

<s>Sam Rayburn has never had to look back at any of his most devastating fights and ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under fire or his political manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions .</s>

<s>this means much to the American tradition .</s>

<s>it is an answer in its way , individual and highly dramatic , to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily vicious in its campaign characteristics .</s>

<s>and the name Rayburn is one of the most dominant in the history of American politics for the last half century .</s>

<s>it is , I insist , hard to define the Rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is so massive and so widespread and so complicated , and because it goes so deep .</s>

<s>but this we know : here is a great life that in every area of American politics gives the American people occasion for pride and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities of honor , decency , and self-respect .</s>

<s>I pray to God that he may be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the United States and the whole world can ill afford to lose .</s>

<s>remarks of Hon.</s>

<s>Melvin Price of Illinois Mr. Price .</s>

<s>all but two of my nine terms in the House of Representatives has been served under the Speakership of Sam Rayburn .</s>

<s>of this I am proud .</s>

<s>I have a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility with which he carries his greatness .</s>

<s>and Sam Rayburn is a great man -- one who will go down in American history as a truly great leader of the Nation .</s>

<s>he will be considered not only great among his contemporaries , but as great among all the Americans who have played a part in the country's history since the beginning .</s>

<s>I pay my personal tribute to Sam Rayburn , stalwart Texan and great American , not only because today he establishes a record of having served as Speaker of the House of Representatives more than twice as long as Henry Clay , but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the Nation during his almost half century of service as a Member of Congress .</s>

<s>Speaker Rayburn has not limited his leadership as a statesman to his direction of the House in the Speaker's chair .</s>

<s>he had an outstanding record as a legislator since the start of his career in the House in 1913 , the 63d Congress .</s>

<s>no one has sponsored more progressive and important legislation than has Sam Rayburn .</s>

<s>he is the recognized father of the Rural Electrification Administration and the Security and Exchange Commission .</s>

<s>but to run the gauntlet of the programs Sam Rayburn brought into being through his legislative efforts would fill the pages of today's Record .</s>

<s>no greater pleasure has come to me in my own service in this House than to be present today to participate in this tribute to this great Speaker , this great legislator , this great Texan , this great American .</s>

<s>my sincere wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today .</s>

<s>remarks of Hon.</s>

<s>John S. Monagan of Connecticut Mr. Monagan
.</s>

<s>Sam Rayburn is one of the greatest American public figures in the history of our country and I consider that I have been singly honored in the privilege of knowing Sam Rayburn and sharing with him the rights and obligations of a Member of the House of Representatives in the Congress of the United States .</s>

<s>others may speak of Speaker Rayburn's uniquely long and devoted service ;
of his championship of many of the progressive social measures which adorn our statute books today , and of his cooperation in times of adversity with Presidents of both of our major parties in helping to pilot the Ship of State through the shoals of today's stormy international seas .</s>

<s>I prefer to speak , however , of Sam Rayburn , the person , rather than Sam Rayburn , the American institution .</s>

<s>although Sam Rayburn affects a gruff exterior in many instances , nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition .</s>

<s>no one could be more devoted than he to the American Congress as an institution and more aware of its historical significance in the political history of the world , and I shall never forget his moving talks , delivered in simple yet eloquent words , upon the meaning of our jobs as Representatives in the operation of representative government and their importance in the context of today's assault upon popular government .</s>

<s>above all , he is a person to whom a fledgling Representative can go to discuss the personal and professional problems which inevitably confront a new Congressman .</s>

<s>in this role of father confessor , he has always been most characteristic and most helpful .</s>

<s>on September 16 , Sam Rayburn will have served as Speaker twice as long as any predecessor and I am proud to join with others in marking this date , and in expressing my esteem for that notable American , Sam Rayburn .</s>

<s>origin of state automobile practices .</s>

<s>the practice of state-owned vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years .</s>

<s>at least one state vehicle was in existence in 1917 .</s>

<s>the state presently owns 389 passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately 200 in 1940 .</s>

<s>the automobile maintenance unit , or motor pool , came into existence in 1942 and has been responsible for centralized maintenance and management of state-owned transportation since that time .</s>

<s>the motor pool has made exceptional progress in automotive management including establishment of cost billing systems , records keeping , analyses of vehicle use , and effecting economies in vehicle operation .</s>

<s>cars were operated in 1959 for an average $.027 per mile .</s>

<s>purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state purchases .</s>

<s>unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal excise taxes .</s>

<s>vehicle purchase , assignment and use policies .</s>

<s>the legislature's role in policy determination concerning state-owned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to appropriating funds for vehicles .</s>

<s>the meaningful policies governing the purchase , assignment , use and management of state vehicles have been shaped by the state's administrative officers .</s>

<s>meaningful policies include : ( A ) kinds of cars the state should own , ( B ) when cars should be traded , ( C ) the need and assignment of vehicles , ( D ) use of cars in lieu of mileage allowances , ( E ) employees taking cars home , and ( F ) need for liability insurance on state automobiles .</s>

<s>a review of these policies indicates : ( 1 ) the state purchases and assigns grades of cars according to need and position status of driver and use of vehicle .</s>

<s>( 2 )
the purchase of compact ( economy ) cars is being made currently on a test basis .</s>

<s>( 3 )
cars are traded mostly on a three-year basis in the interest of economy .</s>

<s>( 4 )
the factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible according to circumstances .</s>

<s>( 5 )
unsuccessful efforts have been made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles .</s>

<s>( 6 )
it is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage state cars at their homes .</s>

<s>( 7 )
the state has recently undertaken liability insurance for drivers of state cars .</s>

<s>automobile practices in other states .</s>

<s>a survey of practices and/or policies in other states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals several points for comparison with Rhode Island's practices .</s>

<s>forty-seven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state business .</s>

<s>two other states provide vehicles , but only with legislative approval .</s>

<s>states which provide automobiles for employees assign them variously to the agency , the individual , or to a central pool .</s>

<s>twenty-six states operate a central motor pool for acquisition , allocation and/or maintenance of state-owned vehicles .</s>

<s>nineteen states report laws , policies or regulations for assigning state vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances .</s>

<s>of these states the average change-over point ( at which a car is substituted for allowances ) is 13,200 miles per year .</s>

<s>mileage allowances .</s>

<s>mileage allowances for state employees are of two types : ( A ) actual mileage and ( B ) fixed monthly allowances .</s>

<s>actual mileage allowances are itemized reimbursements allowed employees for the use of personally-owned vehicles on state business at the rate of $.07 per mile .</s>

<s>fixed monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except on a non-itemized basis .</s>

<s>both allowances are governed by conditions and restrictions set forth in detail in the state's Travel Regulations .</s>

<s>Rhode Island's reimburseable rate of $.07 per mile for use of personally-owned cars compares favorably with other states' rates .</s>

<s>the average of states' rates is $.076 per mile .</s>

<s>Rhode Island's rate of $.07 per mile is considerably lower than reimburseable rates in the federal government and in industry nationally which approximate a $.09 per mile average .</s>

<s>actual mileage allowances are well-administered and not unduly expensive for the state .</s>

<s>the travel regulations , requirements and procedures governing reimbursement are controlled properly and not overly restrictive .</s>

<s>fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject .</s>

<s>they have a great advantage in ease of audit time and payment .</s>

<s>however , they lend themselves to abuse and inadequate control measures .</s>

<s>flat payments over $50 per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of state-owned vehicles .</s>

<s>travel allowances .</s>

<s>travel allowances , including subsistence , have been revised by administrative officials recently and compare favorably with other states' allowances .</s>

<s>with few exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses and $15 per day subsistence .</s>

<s>travel allowances are well-regulated and pose little problem in administration and/or audit control .</s>

<s>origin of state automobile practices general background .</s>

<s>it is difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of the state purchasing automobiles for use of employees in Rhode Island .</s>

<s>few records are available concerning the subject prior to 1940 .</s>

<s>those that are available shed little light .</s>

<s>the Registry of Motor Vehicles indicates that at least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917 .</s>

<s>it should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles is at least forty years old .</s>

<s>the best reason that can be advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded highway construction during the 1920s and '30s .</s>

<s>at that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties .</s>

<s>using privately-owned vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees , and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly justifiable .</s>

<s>once the principle was established , the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly .</s>

<s>and reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth .</s>

<s>Table 1 immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles and employees .</s>

<s>this rate of increase does not signify anything in itself .</s>

<s>it does not indicate loose management , ineffective controls or poor policy .</s>

<s>but it does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees .</s>

<s>in the past twenty years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now .</s>

<s>whether there were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is problematical .</s>

<s>the fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them .</s>

<s>history and operation of the motor pool .</s>

<s>while the origin of state-owned automobiles may be obscured , subsequent developments concerning the assignment , use , and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly .</s>

<s>prior to 1942 , automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned .</s>

<s>this responsibility included all phases of management .</s>

<s>it embraced determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles , who was to drive , when and where repairs were to be made , where gasoline and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters .</s>

<s>in 1942 , however , the nation was at war .</s>

<s>gasoline and automobile tires were rationed commodities .</s>

<s>the state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual .</s>

<s>it met these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit ( more popularly called the motor pool ) , a centralized operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation .</s>

<s>the motor pool then , as now , had headquarter facilities in Providence and other garages located throughout the state .</s>

<s>it was organizationally the responsibility of the Department of Public Works and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation .</s>

<s>in 1951 the pool's operation was transferred to the newly-created Department of Administration , an agency established as the central staff and auxiliary department of the state government .</s>

<s>the management of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner : under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made .</s>

<s>the agencies of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars .</s>

<s>whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations , the introduction of the cost-billing system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis .</s>

<s>one indication of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951-1956 , while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35% , the total maintenance cost increased only 11% .</s>

<s>in order to further refine the management of passenger vehicles , on July 1 , 1958 , the actual title to every vehicle was transferred , by Executive Order , to the Division of Methods , Research and Office Services .</s>

<s>the objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management , assignment , and replacement of all vehicles .</s>

<s>( note : so far as State Police cars are concerned , only their replacement is under this division ) .</s>

<s>this tied in closely with the current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs ( in light of depreciation ) become excessive .</s>

<s>moreover , it allows the present management to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly distributed throughout the fleet ;
for example , if one driver puts on 22,000 miles per year and another driver 8,000 miles per year , their cars will be switched so that both cars will have 30,000 miles after two years , rather than 44,000 miles ( and related higher maintenance costs ) and 16,000 miles respectively .</s>

<s>the motor pool is a completely centralized and mechanized operation .</s>

<s>it handles all types of vehicle maintenance , but concentrates more on service station activities than on extensive vehicle repairs .</s>

<s>it contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work .</s>

<s>where the pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses .</s>

<s>pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon of each vehicle , the miles traveled in one year or three years , the periods when vehicle costs become excessive , and when cars should be traded for sound economies .</s>

<s>from this , motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data .</s>

<s>in 1959-60 , vehicles averaged an operating cost of $.027 per mile .</s>

<s>based on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles , pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of 10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles .</s>

<s>they estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data of compact cars is compiled , the break-even point may be reduced to 7,500 miles of travel per year .</s>

<s>Table 2 shows operating cost data of state vehicles selected at random .</s>

<s>one matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities .</s>

<s>present pool quarters at two locations in Providence are crowded , antiquated and , in general , make for inefficient operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment .</s>

<s>good facilities would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more .</s>

<s>purchasing practices .</s>

<s>the purchase of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state .</s>

<s>requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made .</s>

<s>bids are evaluated by the Division of Purchases with the assistance of pool staff , and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible bidders .</s>

<s>unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public .</s>

<s>the reasons are obvious : ( 1 ) the state is buying in quantity , and ( 2 ) it has no federal excise or state sales tax to pay .</s>

<s>until 1958 the state was also entitled to a special type of manufacturers' discount through the dealers .</s>

<s>in that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool , cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier .</s>

<s>this is a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately cost-accounting principles .</s>

<s>the assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later .</s>

<s>vehicle purchase , assignment , and use policies
probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase , assignment , use , and management of state vehicles .</s>

<s>the legislature's role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles .</s>

<s>the more meaningful policies have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state -- the Director of Administration .</s>

<s>the Rhode Island property tax
there was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well .</s>

<s>for many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax .</s>

<s>this tax was discontinued in 1936 .</s>

<s>since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years .</s>

<s>at the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well .</s>

<s>thus , there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and , in addition , must give assistance to its local governments .</s>

<s>this financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax , or at least at the rates then existing , insufficient for their requirements .</s>

<s>consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and shared taxes , as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level .</s>

<s>notwithstanding state aid , the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax .</s>

<s>this is being done both by the revaluation of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property hitherto neglected or ignored .</s>

<s>taxation of tangible movable property in Rhode Island has been generally of a hands off nature due possibly to several reasons : ( 1 ) local assessors , in the main , are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs , ( 2 ) the numerous categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely difficult , and ( 3 ) the inexperience of the majority of assessors in evaluating this type of property .</s>

<s>problems of taxing personal property .</s>

<s>among the many problems in the taxing of personal property , and of movable tangible property in particular , two are significant : ( 1 ) situs , ( 2 ) fair and equitable assessment of value .</s>

<s>these problems are not local to Rhode Island , but are recognized as common to all states .</s>

<s>situs of property .</s>

<s>although the laws of the various states , in general , specify the situs of property , i.e.</s>

<s>, residence or domicile of the owner , or location of the property , the exceptions regarding boats , airplanes , mobile homes , etc.</s>

<s>, seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment .</s>

<s>Rhode Island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated .</s>

<s>it also provides for the taxation of all personal property , belonging to inhabitants of the state , both tangible and intangible , and the tangible personal property of non-residents in this state .</s>

<s>in defining personal property , it specifically mentions all ships or vessels , at home or abroad .</s>

<s>intangible property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater portion of the year .</s>

<s>although a similar situs for tangible property is mentioned in the statute , this is cancelled out by the provision that definite kinds of property and all other tangible property situated or being in any town is taxable where the property is situated .</s>

<s>this would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property at its location on December 31 .</s>

<s>both boats and aircraft would fall within this category , as well as motor vehicles .</s>

<s>the location of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration , and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is garaged .</s>

<s>obviously , it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of December .</s>

<s>in view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes , in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft .</s>

<s>a recent example of this problem is the flying of six airplanes , on December 31 , 1960 , from the Newport Airpark in Middletown , to the North Central Airport in Smithfield .</s>

<s>this situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax , and probably justifiably .</s>

<s>Middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that all rateable property , both tangible and intangible , shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve ( 12 ) months next preceding the first day of April in each year .</s>

<s>the Smithfield tax assessor , in turn , claims the tax under the provision of law and all other tangible personal property situated or being in any town , in or upon any place of storage shall be taxed to such person in the town where said property is situated .</s>

<s>assessment of value .</s>

<s>this problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors , who in general are non-professional and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem .</s>

<s>this accounts for the wide variance in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in Rhode Island .</s>

<s>this condition will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established , or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopted .</s>

<s>the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in its publication once commented : the most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the State take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property .</s>

<s>an adequately staffed and equipped State assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout the State .</s>

<s>a single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different and independent assessing units .</s>

<s>the Institute of Public Administration , in its report to the State Fiscal Study Commission in 1959 , recommended consolidating and centralizing all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally organized and equipped for the job .</s>

<s>the resulting setup , it was declared , would be similar to that which is in successful operation in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than Rhode Island .</s>

<s>practices in Rhode Island .</s>

<s>to determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property , a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in Rhode Island .</s>

<s>the replies from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case .</s>

<s>there are legitimate reasons for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among the public officials in each town .</s>

<s>these opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time .</s>

<s>in reply to a question of whether they now tax boats , airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles , nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not .</s>

<s>the wording of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different interpretations .</s>

<s>one assessor checked boats only , another trailers and tractors , one mentioned house trailers , and two others referred to trailers without specifying the type .</s>

<s>in two cases , airplanes only were indicated .</s>

<s>it is difficult to tabulate exactly what was meant in each individual situation , but the conclusion may be drawn that 21 towns do not assess movable personal property , and of the remainder only certain types are valued for tax purposes .</s>

<s>boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats .</s>

<s>it would seem , then , that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property .</s>

<s>so few answered the question relating to their efforts to assess movable property that the results are inconclusive .</s>

<s>only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind .</s>

<s>of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership .</s>

<s>fifteen stated that it was according to location , four by residence of the owner , and nineteen did not answer .</s>

<s>twenty-seven assessors stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable personal property , and only five were opposed .</s>

<s>seven others expressed no opinion .</s>

<s>on this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now .</s>

<s>it is not clear , however , whether they are thinking of all movable property or only of boats , trailers , aircraft or certain other types of personal property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular towns .</s>

<s>another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner .</s>

<s>eighteen voted for assessment by the town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in which the owner resides .</s>

<s>ten others made no reply .</s>

<s>of those who have an opinion , it seems that assessment by location is preferred .</s>

<s>there was one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date .</s>

<s>to summarize , it may be said that there is no one prevailing practice in Rhode Island with respect to the taxation of movable property , that assessors would like to see an improvement , and of those who have an opinion , that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge .</s>

<s>the need for greater knowledge is evident from their replies .</s>

<s>boats as personal property taxing of boats .</s>

<s>interest has been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats .</s>

<s>assessors in Rhode Island are charged not only with placing a valuation upon real and personal property , but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax a sum not less than nor more than a specified amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting .</s>

<s>it has been obvious to the assessors , particularly those in shore communities , that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal property which they have been unable to reach .</s>

<s>through their professional organization , the Rhode Island Tax Officials Association the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed .</s>

<s>no satisfactory solution has been found , but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessors .</s>

<s>it has been estimated that the value of boats in Rhode Island waters is something in excess of fifty million dollars , excluding commercial boats .</s>

<s>it is obvious that this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation .</s>

<s>it is known that at least five towns ( Barrington , Bristol , Narragansett , Newport and Westerly ) place some value on some boats for tax purposes .</s>

<s>however , few are taxed , and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town valuations .</s>

<s>no one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be .</s>

<s>slightly more than 5,000 boats were registered with the Coast Guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law .</s>

<s>only a few more than 10,000 boats had been registered with the Division of Harbors and Rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season , but many had been taken out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought the season to an early close .</s>

<s>the assessors' association , meeting at Narragansett in September 1960 , devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem .</s>

<s>local industry's investment in Rhode Island was the big story in 1960's industrial development effort .</s>

<s>fifty-two companies started or committed themselves to new plant construction , totaling 1,418,000 square feet and representing an investment of $11,900,000 ;
a new post-World War 2 record .</s>

<s>with minor exceptions , this expansion was instituted either by firms based in Rhode Island or out-of-state manufacturers already operating here .</s>

<s>what made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation , Rhode Island scored marked progress in new industry , new plants , and new jobs .</s>

<s>of the major expansions in 1960 , three were financed under the R. I.</s>

<s>Industrial Building Authority's 100% guaranteed mortgage plan : Collyer Wire , Leesona Corporation , and American Tube & Controls .</s>

<s>leading firms that arranged their own financing included Speidel Corporation , Cornell-Dubilier , Photek , Inc. Division of Textron , Narragansett Gray Iron Foundry , W. R. Cobb Company , and Mays Manufacturing Company .</s>

<s>expansion and relocation of industry in Rhode Island is the direct responsibility of the Development Council's Industrial Division , and the figures quoted above indicate a successful year's operation .</s>

<s>Industrial Division personnel worked with 54 out-of-state and 97 Rhode Island concerns during 1960 , many of whom are still interested in a Rhode Island location .</s>

<s>they are conscious of this state's new feeling of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of new plants and construction projects in Rhode Island .</s>

<s>aids to small business
although much of the Industrial Division's promotional effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by major industries , small business is also afforded considerable attention .</s>

<s>our Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce carries on a vigorous program , directly aimed at solving and expediting the problems of manufacturers in the lower employment categories .</s>

<s>a primary function is the operation of a Government Bid Center , which receives bids daily from the Federal Government's principal purchasing agencies .</s>

<s>assistance is rendered to interested Rhode Island businessmen concerning interpretation of bid invitations , where to obtain specifications , and follow-ups concerning qualification .</s>

<s>during the past year , 10,517 government bid invitations were received and 4,427 procurement leads were mailed to Rhode Island manufacturers .</s>

<s>in addition , the Office's domestic trade program provided consultant services to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses ;
how and where to apply for financial assistance ;
details on marketing ;
information concerning patents , copyrights and trade marks , availability of technical reports , and other subjects of interest to small business .</s>

<s>the Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce is also active in the field of international trade , assisting Rhode Island firms in developing and enlarging markets abroad .</s>

<s>this office cooperates with the U. S. Department of Commerce in giving statewide coverage to services which include : statistics on markets abroad ;
locating foreign agents , buyers , distributors , etc.</s>

<s>;
information on foreign and domestic import duties and regulations , licensing , investments , and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad , and documentary requirements concerning export shipments and arrangements for payment .</s>

<s>during the year 1960 , this office supplied 954 visitors with information related to foreign and domestic commerce , and made 73 field visits .</s>

<s>advertising program
our media advertising continued , during 1960 , its previous effective program that stressed such specifics as 100% financing , plant availabilities , and location advantages .</s>

<s>we also continued to run a series of ads featuring endorsement of Rhode Island by industrialists who had recently established new plants here .</s>

<s>to reach a still greater audience of location-minded manufacturers , our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal year was increased from $32,000 to $40,000 , and the Industrial Building Authority's financial participation was upped from $17,000 to $20,000 .</s>

<s>newspaper advertising was mainly concentrated in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal ( Eastern and Midwestern editions ) which averaged two prominent ads per month , and to a lesser degree the New York Herald Tribune and , for the west coast , the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal ( Pacific Coast edition ) .</s>

<s>in addition to the regular schedule , advertisements were run for maximum impact in special editions of the New York Times , Boston Herald , American Banker , Electronic News and , for local promotion , the Providence Sunday Journal .</s>

<s>magazine advertising included Management Methods , The New Englander , U. S. Investor , and Plant Location .</s>

<s>the direct mail campaign consisted of 3 intra-state mailings of 1680 letters each and 6 out-of-state directed to electronics , plastics , pharmaceutical , and business machine manufacturers , and to publishers .</s>

<s>these totaled 6,768 pieces of correspondence .</s>

<s>the 1960 advertising campaign brought a total of 239 inquiries ;
164 from media and 75 from direct mail .</s>

<s>two hundred and nineteen were received from 35 of our 50 United States and 11 came from foreign countries .</s>

<s>New York led in the number of inquiries , followed by California , New Jersey , Massachusetts , and Pennsylvania .</s>

<s>among foreign countries responding were Germany , Canada , Brazil and India .</s>

<s>industrial promotion
an important operation in soliciting industrial locations involves what we term Missionary calls by one of this Division's industrial promotion specialists .</s>

<s>these consist of visits , without previous announcement , on top officials of manufacturing concerns located in highly industrialized areas .</s>

<s>more than 25 carefully selected cities were visited , including New York , Brooklyn , Long Island City , Newark , Elizabeth , Stamford , Waterbury , New Haven , Bridgeport , Boston , Cambridge , Worcester , and Waltham .</s>

<s>out of a total of 603 calls , 452 contacts were established with top executive personnel .</s>

<s>we received 76 out-of-state visitors interested in investigating Rhode Island's industrial advantages , and Industrial Division personnel made 55 out-of-state follow-up visits .</s>

<s>industrial conferences
during 1960 , two important conferences were organized by the Development Council's Industrial Division .</s>

<s>in June , the Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce -- in conjunction with local trade associations , chambers of commerce , and bank officials -- sponsored a World Trade Conference at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel .</s>

<s>its purpose was to find ways of offsetting the United States' declining balance of trade for 1958 and 1959 .</s>

<s>approximately 100 representatives of business attended this conclave and the R. I.</s>

<s>Export Conference Committee later voted to continue the activity as an annual event .</s>

<s>on October 8th of last year , the Industrial Division sponsored the Governor's Conference on Industrial Development at the former Henry Barnard School .</s>

<s>a comprehensive program devoted to the various phases of the development effort attracted 143 interested individuals .</s>

<s>morning sessions included addresses by Ward Miller , Jr. of the U. S. Dept.</s>

<s>of Commerce .</s>

<s>Richard Preston , executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission , and Edwin C. Kepler of General Electric Company .</s>

<s>workshop sessions in the afternoon featured development executives from Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Maine , and rounded out a rewarding program .</s>

<s>in connection with this conference , a 64-page supplement was published in the October 2nd edition of The Providence Sunday Journal .</s>

<s>devoted to the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in Rhode Island , it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this Division .</s>

<s>more than 2000 copies have been sent out to prospective clients .</s>

<s>mailings and publications
other special mailings by the Industrial Division included copies of speeches delivered at the Governor's Conference , letters and brochures to conferees at Med-Chemical Symposium at University of Rhode Island and letters and reprints of industrial advertisements to such organizations as Society of Industrial Realtors .</s>

<s>1184 copies of the R. I. Directory Of Manufacturers were distributed : 643 in-state and 541 out-of-state .</s>

<s>the Industrial Division published , in 1960 , a new , attractive industrial brochure , Rhode Island -- Right For Industry , and prepared copy for a new edition of the Directory Of Manufacturers ( to be printed shortly ) , and for a new space catalogue .</s>

<s>additional promotional activities included organizing the dedication program for Operation Turnkey , the new automated post office , and a conference with representatives of Brown University , Providence College , and University of Rhode Island , and eight electronics concerns regarding the inauguration of a training program for electronics personnel .</s>

<s>planning division
stated in its simplest terms , the main job of the Planning Division is to plan for the future of the State of Rhode Island .</s>

<s>the activities of the Planning Division are defined in considerable detail in the enabling act of the Development Council , which assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning .</s>

<s>two years ago , the Institute of Public Administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled State-Local Relations In Metropolitan Rhode Island .</s>

<s>as the result of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contained in this report , plus an analysis of our own enabling act , the Planning Division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused a reorientation of its work program .</s>

<s>these objectives are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the Planning Division .</s>

<s>( 1 )
first priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state .</s>

<s>( 2 )
recognizing the truth of the statement by the Institute of Public Administration that Metropolian Planning ( in Rhode Island ) means , or should mean , state planning , the state guide plan will take into account the metropolitan nature of many of Rhode Island's problems .</s>

<s>( 3 )
it will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local government .</s>

<s>to this end , the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available , on a shared cost basis , technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff .</s>

<s>( 4 )
the planning division will take the initiative in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government ;
among the operating departments of the state ;
between the cities and towns of the state ;
and on a regional basis between the six New England states .</s>

<s>( 5 )
on the basis that all citizens of the state are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources , plans for the provision of essential services ( such as water ) will be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries , within the framework of the state plan .</s>

<s>( 6 )
the state development budget will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan .</s>

<s>( 7 )
in preparing the state guide plan , particular attention will be given means of strengthening the economy of the state through the development of industry and recreation .</s>

<s>functionally the planning division carries out four activities : long-range state planning , current state planning , local planning assistance ;
and the preparation of the state development budget .</s>

<s>long-range state planning
the planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation .</s>

<s>the long-range aspects of this program are divided into four distinct phases : basic mapping , inventory , analysis and plan and policy formation .</s>

<s>the work program , as it was originally proposed , was to take five years to complete .</s>

<s>recent events -- particularly the necessity of providing planning information for the statewide origin/destination study of the Department of Public Works -- indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated .</s>

<s>the basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled for completion July 1 , 1961 .</s>

<s>basic mapping
since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning program , the first step taken by the planning division to implement the long-range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps -- one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile , and the second a series of 26 sheets at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet , covering the entire state .</s>

<s>with these maps completed , the inventory
phase of the plan has been started .</s>

<s>inventory with the aid of matching federal funds available under Section 701 of the Housing Act of 1954 as amended , the planning division began a one year program July 1 , 1960 to complete the inventory phase of the state planning program .</s>

<s>this phase consists of four items : urban land use , rural land use , physical features and public utility service areas .</s>

<s>since the validity of all subsequent planning depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information , great care is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible .</s>

<s>the urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide planning .</s>

<s>the rural land use study is being carried out under contract by the University of Rhode Island and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use .</s>

<s>the mapping of important physical features such as slopes and types of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and , like the other two inventory projects , are scheduled for completion July 1 , 1961 .</s>

<s>analysis
the collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose .</s>

<s>special districts in Rhode island .</s>

<s>it is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode Island .</s>

<s>however , a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government .</s>

<s>there are forty-seven special district governments in Rhode Island ( excluding two regional school districts , four housing authorities , and the Kent County Water Authority ) .</s>

<s>these forty-seven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes , to borrow money , own property , sue and be sued , and in general to exercise normal corporate powers .</s>

<s>unlike cities and towns , however , they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state Bureau of Audits .</s>

<s>it is not an exaggeration to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government .</s>

<s>in addition to the collection of service charges , the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $450,000 .</s>

<s>fiscal years in other states comparative data
.</s>

<s>a review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report .</s>

<s>included in the findings are : 1 .</s>

<s>forty-six states , including Rhode Island , end their fiscal year on June 30 .</s>

<s>the other four states end on varying dates : Alabama ( Sept. 30 ) , New York ( March 31 ) , Pennsylvania ( May 31 ) , and Texas ( August 31 ) .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>in sixteen states , the fiscal year ending of the cities ( June 30 ) is the same as that of the state : Alaska , Arizona , California , Delaware , Massachusetts , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , North Carolina , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Oregon , Vermont , West Virginia , Wyoming , and Hawaii ) .</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>in eleven states , the fiscal year of the cities ends on December 31 , while the state fiscal year ends on June 30 ( Arkansas , Colorado , Indiana , Kansas , New Hampshire , New Jersey , Ohio , South Dakota , Utah , Washington , and Wisconsin ) .</s>

<s>4 .</s>

<s>in eight states whose fiscal years close on June 30 , a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on December 31 :
( Georgia , Iowa , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , Virginia , and South Carolina ) .</s>

<s>5 .</s>

<s>one state , Alabama , closes its fiscal year on September 30 , and all cities in the state , with one exception , also close fiscal years on September 30 .</s>

<s>6 .</s>

<s>Mississippi closes its fiscal year on June 30 , while all of its cities close their fiscal years on September 30 .</s>

<s>7 .</s>

<s>Pennsylvania closes its fiscal year on May 31 .</s>

<s>all of its cities close their fiscal years on December 31 .</s>

<s>the remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state , city and local governments .</s>

<s>however , only Illinois , Oregon , Louisiana and Rhode Island have a situation in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity .</s>

<s>fiscal uniformity : advantages and disadvantages
advantages .</s>

<s>an excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently .</s>

<s>he listed among the values of fiscal uniformity : 1 .</s>

<s>the uniform fiscal year requires compliance with common sense administration of local finances : adoption of the budget , or financial plan , in advance of spending .</s>

<s>2 .</s>

<s>the uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another common sense rule , that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn .</s>

<s>it enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts .</s>

<s>3 .</s>

<s>the uniform fiscal year promotes more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures .</s>

<s>by fixing the tax rate in advance of spending , upper limits are set on expenditures .</s>

<s>4 .</s>

<s>the uniform fiscal year brings the town's fiscal year into line with that of the schools , which expend the largest share of local disbursements .</s>

<s>this greatly simplifies the town's bookkeeping and financial reporting .</s>

<s>5 .</s>

<s>the uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes .</s>

<s>furthermore , tax collections not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes , augmenting the town's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax levy .</s>

<s>6 .</s>

<s>the uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison of revenues and expenditures .</s>

<s>when towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons ;
and as the cost of local government increases , the demand for such comparison also increases .</s>

<s>towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare .</s>

<s>of all advantages , probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes .</s>

<s>borrowing in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at all times .</s>

<s>it may be by bank loans , sale of notes or warrants , or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and registration of warrants .</s>

<s>in any event it is a form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered unnecessary .</s>

<s>its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs , heavy when short-term money rates are high , and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most .</s>

<s>this type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year .</s>

<s>any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security .</s>

<s>it should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year .</s>

<s>both the federal and state governments commence their fiscal years on July 1 .</s>

<s>both units of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below : it has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property tax , the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap ;
but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid , the emphasis on equalization , and the state-local sharing of responsibility for certain important functions , this is no longer true .</s>

<s>the haphazard fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local revenue and expenditure relationships .</s>

<s>disadvantages .</s>

<s>although there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal years in Rhode Island , there are also certain difficulties encountered .</s>

<s>these involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantages to the principle .</s>

<s>one problem is a matter of shifting dates ;
the other , is how to finance the transition .</s>

<s>little can be done about the changing of dates .</s>

<s>this is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars .</s>

<s>it usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period of time .</s>

<s>but cooperation and understanding between local officials and the citizenry help lessen this problem .</s>

<s>the other problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns .</s>

<s>this will be covered more fully later .</s>

<s>it should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city .</s>

<s>fortunately , there are no cities or towns in the state , with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change .</s>

<s>sacrifice will have to be made in some cases , but it is to the municipality's advantage to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely .</s>

<s>adjusting the fiscal calendars
the advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for Rhode Island municipalities to exert effort to secure them .</s>

<s>the type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed .</s>

<s>two features are immediately evident .</s>

<s>first , the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula .</s>

<s>second , the shift to a uniform July 1 to June 30 fiscal year will , of itself , improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns .</s>

<s>there are at least two problems to consider : one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar ;
the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary .</s>

<s>the latter matter is considered in detail in a later section .</s>

<s>twelve cities and towns in Rhode Island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform and/or coordinated fiscal tax year calendar .</s>

<s>plans vary from the talking stage to establishing special committees to accomplish this end .</s>

<s>what is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them .</s>

<s>an analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought .</s>

<s>however , it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved .</s>

<s>the adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout Rhode Island , based on a July 1 to June 30 year , are shown below .</s>

<s>no adjustment needed .</s>

<s>six cities and towns are presently on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection year with it .</s>

<s>no change is required for these towns .</s>

<s>these municipalities include : Barrington , Lincoln , Middletown , Newport , North Kingstown , and South Kingstown .</s>

<s>adjustment of fiscal year .</s>

<s>one town and one city , Coventry and East Providence , require an adjustment of their fiscal year only .</s>

<s>this change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year .</s>

<s>adjustment of tax collection year .</s>

<s>six cities and towns are now on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity .</s>

<s>these cities and towns include Bristol , Glocester , Pawtucket , Cumberland , Central Falls , and Woonsocket .</s>

<s>simultaneous adjustments .</s>

<s>two cities to be considered , Providence and Cranston , are an enigma .</s>

<s>both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars .</s>

<s>however , neither of these two cities is on the desired July 1 to June 30 fiscal year .</s>

<s>the adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them .</s>

<s>in that both cities end their fiscal years on September 30 , they could levy taxes for an interim period of nine months , commencing with September 30 and ending with June 30 .</s>

<s>these three installment dates would be : October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 ( Providence ) and November 15 , February 16 and May 15 ( Cranston ) .</s>

<s>both would start their new fiscal year on July 1 .</s>

<s>their tax collection calendar could then be : July 25 , October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 , ( Providence ) ;
and August 15 , November 15 , February 17 , and May 15 , ( Cranston ) .</s>

<s>under this plan both Cranston and Providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods .</s>

<s>varying adjustments .</s>

<s>the remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal years which end prior to June 30 .</s>

<s>all of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years .</s>

<s>assuming an adjustment to the July 1 to June 30 fiscal year , the required adjustment of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in Table 3 .</s>

<s>methods of financing adjustments
aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars , there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary .</s>

<s>it should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements .</s>

<s>in many communities there is simply no financial problem ;
it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods , careful fiscal planning and management , or some like combination of techniques .</s>

<s>in other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal year changes .</s>

<s>fortunately , such cases in Rhode Island are more the exception than the rule .</s>

<s>as shown earlier in Table 1 , the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection calendars .</s>

<s>in addition , no two Rhode Island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition .</s>

<s>these factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible ;
each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars , the financial condition of the treasuries , and the length of the transition interval .</s>

<s>suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds .</s>

<s>the financial problem , where it exists , usually stems from the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period .</s>

<s>for those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments , there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone , or in combination with others , would minimize if not even eliminate the problem .</s>

<s>Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency

<s>its supplement , The Medical Technicians Bulletin , supplied similar material to enlisted medical personnel .</s>

<s>these publications replaced the U. S. Naval Medical Bulletin , published continuously from 1907 through 1959 , as well as the Navy's Hospital Corps Quarterly and the Bulletin of the U. S. Army Medical Department , published from 1922 to 1949 .</s>

<s>in addition , their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated Air Force medical bulletin .</s>

<s>estimated annual savings resulting from publication of the Journal and Bulletin on a triservice basis , as compared with the cost of producing separate periodicals for each service , were between $65,000 and $70,000 .</s>

<s>additionally , on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations , the availability of the Journal removed the necessity of subscribing to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized , in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage .</s>

<s>from 1 July 1958 to 30 June 1960 , 24 numbers of the Journal and nine of the Bulletin were published .</s>

<s>each Journal contained articles of professional and clinical interest , and departments devoted to military medical news , reviews of new books , and other features of interest to officers of the medical services .</s>

<s>the Council on National Defense of the American Medical Association contributed a brief article to each issue entitled , This Is Your A.M.A.</s>

<s>.</s>

<s>beginning with the October 1959 issue of the Journal , the method of production of copy for photo-offset reproduction was changed from varityping to hot typesetting .</s>

<s>this resulted in an improved appearance , but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total of allocated funds .</s>

<s>the use of 100 instead of 140 substance paper plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the May 1960 issue reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with nearly $4,000 in unexpended funds .</s>

<s>two special issues were published , one for November 1959 on Space Medicine , the other the Tenth Anniversary issue for January 1960 .</s>

<s>the February 1960 issue marked the reinstitution of the section entitled , The Medical Officer Writes .</s>

<s>replacing the discontinued Medical Technicians Bulletin , publication of which was suspended with the November-December 1959 issue , a section called Technical Notes was inaugurated on a bimonthly basis beginning with the April 1960 issue .</s>

<s>occasional features were published on historical medicine , special reports , bibliography , and Collector's Items .</s>

<s>in May 1960 , the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology began a series of articles on the Medical Museum , and in June , the Institute started contributing a regular monthly Case For Diagnosis .</s>

<s>the Institute also planned to furnish a regular series of articles , beginning in the fall of 1960 , on its more significant Scientific Exhibits .</s>

<s>the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board agreed to submit each month a report for one of its 12 commissions , so that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest and value to medical officers of the Armed Forces .</s>

<s>the first report in this continuing series appeared in the September 1960 issue of the Journal .</s>

<s>another recent achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product is relatively non-volatile .</s>

<s>this work gave a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method , and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago .</s>

<s>similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product , beryllium fluoride .</s>

<s>the development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion .</s>

<s>in one of these , an exploding-wire device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6,000 F and 100 atmospheres pressure , a major goal was achieved .</s>

<s>the accuracy of measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 percent .</s>

<s>this agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals .</s>

<s>the method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter .</s>

<s>the element is inserted in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire , and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy .</s>

<s>this is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element .</s>

<s>a high-speed shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion .</s>

<s>the shutter consists of two parts : a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part .</s>

<s>using Edgerton's method , the fast-closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires .</s>

<s>the fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil ( approximately F ) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera .</s>

<s>the opening action is obtained when a capacitor , charged to high voltage , is suddenly discharged through the foil .</s>

<s>during the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera .</s>

<s>experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds .</s>

<s>the shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil .</s>

<s>laboratory measurements of interstellar radio spectra
.</s>

<s>besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 J wavelength , the spectra of extraterrestrial radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms , ions , and small molecules .</s>

<s>the detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and , perhaps , planetary atmospheres .</s>

<s>among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides J and J ;
somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides J , J , and J .</s>

<s>very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable ;
in interstellar gas , concentrations as low as F molecules per F may be sufficient , as compared to the F hydrogen atom's F required for detection of the 21-cm line .</s>

<s>high sensitivity in radio telescopes is achieved by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver ;
therefore , only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible .</s>

<s>to secure precise measurements of these frequencies , a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy has been started .</s>

<s>since conventional methods are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions , the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead .</s>

<s>this involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor , which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave range , where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity .</s>

<s>the first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the J radical .</s>

<s>results of this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which J may be identified in interstellar gas ;
the frequencies are 1665.32 and 1667.36 F , with an uncertainty of 0.10 F .</s>

<s>success in observing these spectral lines has so far , apparently , been confined to the laboratory ;
extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported .</s>

<s>preparations are being made for similar experiments on J and J radicals .</s>

<s>low temperature thermometry .</s>

<s>the Bureau is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 F .</s>

<s>the efforts and accomplishments fall into three main categories : absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas , secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors , and helium-4 vapor-pressure measurements ( see p. 144 ) .</s>

<s>acoustical interferometer
.</s>

<s>an acoustical interferometer has been constructed and used , with helium gas as the thermometric fluid , to measure temperatures near 4.2 and 2.1 F .</s>

<s>such an interferometer provides a means of absolute temperature measurement , and may be used as an alternative to the gas thermometer .</s>

<s>when values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium-4 vapor pressures , differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively were found .</s>

<s>this result is preliminary , and work is continuing .</s>

<s>resistance thermometers .</s>

<s>carbon resistors and impurity-doped germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region .</s>

<s>several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 F and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1/3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium .</s>

<s>preliminary calibrations of the resistors have been made from 4.21 to 2.16 F at every 0.1 F .</s>

<s>the estimated standard deviations of the data for two of the resistors were 1 millidegree ;
and for the third resistor , 3.3 millidegrees .</s>

<s>vapor pressure method .</s>

<s>the reproducibilities of helium vapor-pressure thermometers have been investigated in conjunction with a constant temperature liquid helium bath from 4.2 to 1.8 F .</s>

<s>surface temperature gradients have been found to exist in liquid helium baths contained in 15- and 25-liter metallic storage dewars .</s>

<s>the gradient was about one half of a millidegree at 4.2 F but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly greater than the J point .</s>

<s>a hydrostatic head correction has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium .</s>

<s>however , the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate the tube ( which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb ) from the liquid helium surface .</s>

<s>it has also been observed , in helium 2 , that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer .</s>

<s>this has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer .</s>

<s>in this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow .</s>

<s>pressure transducer for J measurements .</s>

<s>precise pressure-volume-temperature measurements on corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer .</s>

<s>a prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested .</s>

<s>the transducer is a null-type instrument and employs a stretched diaphragm , 0.001 in.</s>

<s>thick and 1 in.</s>

<s>in diameter .</s>

<s>a small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced 0.001 in.</s>

<s>apart ( for F ) .</s>

<s>spherical concave backing surfaces support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit .</s>

<s>over a temperature range from 25 to 200 F and at pressures up to 250 J , an overload of 300 J , applied for a period of one day , results in an uncertainty in the pressure of , at most , one millimeter of mercury .</s>

<s>transport properties of air .</s>

<s>a 6-year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed .</s>

<s>this project was carried out under sponsorship of the Ballistic Missile Division of the Air Research and Development Command , U.S. Air Force , and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding .</s>

<s>a significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region .</s>

<s>another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present .</s>

<s>the results of the study , based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air , will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1,000 to 10,000 F and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from F to F times normal density .</s>

<s>international cooperative activities .</s>

<s>in March , 1961 , representatives of the national laboratories of Australia , Canada , The Netherlands , United Kingdom , U.S.S.R. , United States , and West Germany , met at the J to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90 F .</s>

<s>as a first step toward this goal , arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory .</s>

<s>such a group of thermometers was obtained and calibrated at the J .</s>

<s>these thermometers have now been sent to the United Kingdom for calibration at the National Physical Laboratory .</s>

<s>temperature symposium .</s>

<s>during the last week of march 1961 , Columbus , Ohio was the site of the Fourth Symposium on Temperature , Its Measurement And Control In Science And Industry .</s>

<s>the Symposium , which was jointly sponsored by the American Institute of Physics , the Instrument Society of America , and the National Bureau of Standards , attracted nearly one thousand registrants , including many from abroad .</s>

<s>the Bureau contributed to the planning and success of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr. W. A. Wildhack , General Chairman , and Dr. C. M. Herzfeld , Program Chairman .</s>

<s>under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research and the Advanced Research Projects Agency , a data center was established to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probabilities .</s>

<s>an exhaustive survey was made of the literature , and a primary reference file of approximately 600 references was catalogued .</s>

<s>selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now in preparation .</s>

<s>a wall-stabilized high-current arc source was constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen and oxygen .</s>

<s>this apparatus will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large number of other elements .</s>

<s>a study of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about F percent .</s>

<s>a set of tables containing spectral intensities for 39,000 lines of 70 elements , as observed in a copper matrix in a J arc , was completed and published .</s>

<s>studies of the intensity data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition probabilities .</s>

<s>Mr. Dooley .</s>

<s>Mr. Speaker , for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have .</s>

<s>the causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex -- high taxes , losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers , to name but two .</s>

<s>and the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied , ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service .</s>

<s>there have been a number of sound plans proposed .</s>

<s>but none of these has been implemented .</s>

<s>instead we have stood idly by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping hand .</s>

<s>though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased tremendously since World War 2 , total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million for 1947 to 1957 .</s>

<s>nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the New York City area .</s>

<s>here the New York Central Railroad , one of the Nation's most important carriers , has alone lost 47.6 percent of its passengers since 1949 .</s>

<s>at this time of crisis in our Nation's commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New York Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad's proposal for control of the Baltimore & Ohio railroads .</s>

<s>the New York Central has pointed out that this control , if approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission , would give the combined C. & O.</s>

<s>- B.</s>

<s>& O.</s>

<s>Railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the New York Central .</s>

<s>not only is this kind of duplication wasteful , but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New York Central and other railroads serving the area .</s>

<s>the New York Central notes : the freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the C. & O.</s>

<s>- B.</s>

<s>& O. provides the backbone of Central's revenues .</s>

<s>these revenues make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire New York Central system as well as the New York area commuter and terminal freight services .</s>

<s>if these services are to be maintained , the New York Central must have the revenues to make them possible .</s>

<s>the New York Central today handles 60 percent of all southbound commuter traffic coming into New York City .</s>

<s>this is a $14 million operation involving 3,500 employees who work on commuter traffic exclusively .</s>

<s>a blow to this phase of the Central's operations would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad itself , but to the 40,000 people per day who are provided with efficient , reasonably priced transportation in and out of the city .</s>

<s>there is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful C. & O.</s>

<s>- B.</s>

<s>& O. merger scheme -- the Central has pointed out .</s>

<s>the logic of creating a strong , balanced , competitive two-system railroad service in the East is so obvious that B.</s>

<s>& O. was publicly committed to the approach outlined here .</s>

<s>detailed studies of the plan were well underway .</s>

<s>though far from completion , these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned , their investors , their customers , their users , and to the public at large .</s>

<s>then , abandoning the studies in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned , B.</s>

<s>& O. entered on-again-off-again negotiations with C. & O. which resulted in the present situation .</s>

<s>in the light of the facts at hand , however , New York Central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create a healthy two-system eastern railroad structure in the public interest .</s>

<s>the Interstate Commerce Commission will commence its deliberations on the proposed C. & O.</s>

<s>- B.</s>

<s>& O. merger on June 18 .</s>

<s>obviously , the Interstate Commerce Commission will not force the New York Central to further curtail its commuter operations by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge .</s>

<s>however , there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss .</s>

<s>that is , will it serve the long-range public interest ?</s>

<s>for the past 40 years Congress has advocated a carefully planned , balanced and competitive railway system .</s>

<s>we must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter -- the two-way B.</s>

<s>- C. & O. merger , or the three-way New York Central - B.</s>

<s>Mr. Speaker , I rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper , the New York Times , on the occasion of a major change in its top executive command .</s>

<s>Arthur Hays Sulzberger has been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to American journalism on the occasion of his retirement .</s>

<s>I am pleased to note that Mr. Sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the board of the New York Times .</s>

<s>Mr. Sulzberger's successor as publisher is Mr. Orvil E. Dryfoos , who is president of the New York Times Co. , and who has been with the Times since 1942 .</s>

<s>Mr. Dryfoos' outstanding career as a journalist guarantees that the high standards which have made the Times one of the world's great newspapers will be maintained .</s>

<s>I am also pleased to note that Mr. John B. Oakes , a member of the Times staff since 1946 , has been appointed as editorial page editor .</s>

<s>Mr. Oakes succeeds Charles Merz , editor since 1938 , who now becomes editor emeritus .</s>

<s>I should like at this time , Mr. Speaker , to pay warm tribute to Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Charles Merz on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished careers in American journalism .</s>

<s>my heartiest congratulations go to their successors , Orvil E. Dryfoos and John B. Oakes , who can be counted upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the New York Times .</s>

<s>Mr. Stratton .</s>

<s>Mr. Speaker , in my latest newsletter to my constituents I urged the imposition of a naval blockade of Cuba as the only effective method of preventing continued Soviet armaments from coming into the Western Hemisphere in violation of the Monroe Doctrine .</s>

<s>yesterday , I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U.S. News & World Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail , including both its advantages and its disadvantages .</s>

<s>under leave to extend my remarks , I include the relevant portion of my newsletter , together with the text of the article from the U.S. News & World Report : your Congressman , Samuel S. Stratton , reports from Washington , May 1 , 1961 .</s>

<s>Cuban S.S.R.</s>

<s>: whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro-held mainland last week , there was at least one positive benefit , and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian-dominated military base .</s>

<s>in fact , one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment .</s>

<s>somehow , the pictures and stories of Soviet J tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home .</s>

<s>Russian tanks and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United States , violate the Monroe Doctrine , and threaten the security of every other Latin American republic .</s>

<s>once the full extent of this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear , President Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone .</s>

<s>but the Latin American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American Defense Board .</s>

<s>for years the United States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro's representative from secret military talks .</s>

<s>but it took the pictures of the Migs and the J tanks to do the job .</s>

<s>there is a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week .</s>

<s>you can see it , for example , in the extensive efforts President Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos ;
efforts , as I see it , which are being directed , by the way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past .</s>

<s>what the next move will be only time , of course , will tell .</s>

<s>personally , I think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of Cuba .</s>

<s>we simply can't tolerate further Russian weapons , including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles , being located in Cuba .</s>

<s>obviously , we can't stop them from coming in , however , just by talk .</s>

<s>a naval blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine , would be a relatively simple operation to carry out , and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere .</s>

<s>( from U.s. News & World Report , May 8 , 1961 ) next for Cuba : an arms blockade ?</s>

<s>look at Castro now -- cockier than ever with arms and agents to threaten the Americas .</s>

<s>how can the United States act ?</s>

<s>blockade is one answer offered by experts .</s>

<s>in it they see a way to isolate Cuba , stop infiltration , maybe finish Castro , too .</s>

<s>this is the question now facing President Kennedy : how to put a stop to the Soviet buildup in Cuba and to Communist infiltration of this hemisphere ?</s>

<s>on April 25 , the White House reported that a total embargo of remaining U.S. trade with Cuba was being considered .</s>

<s>its aim : to undermine further Cuba's economy .</s>

<s>weaken Castro .</s>

<s>another strategy -- bolder and tougher -- was also attracting notice in Washington : a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world , destroy Castro .</s>

<s>blockade , in the view of military and civilian experts , could restore teeth to the Monroe Doctrine .</s>

<s>it could halt a flood of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro .</s>

<s>it could stop Cuban re-export of guns and propaganda materials to South America .</s>

<s>it would be the most severe reprisal , short of declared war , that the United States could invoke against Castro .</s>

<s>it is the strategy of blockade , therefore , that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials , Members of Congress , officers in the Pentagon .</s>

<s>as a possible course of action , it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions .</s>

<s>among these questions : what would a Cuba blockade take ?</s>

<s>military experts say a tight naval blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task forces , each built around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers .</s>

<s>the Navy , on April 25 , announced it is bringing back the carrier Shangri-La from the Mediterranean , increasing to four the number of attack carriers in the vicinity of Cuba .</s>

<s>more than 36 other big Navy ships are no less than a day's sailing time away .</s>

<s>to round out the blockading force , submarines would be needed -- to locate , identify and track approaching vessels .</s>

<s>land-based radar would help with this task .</s>

<s>so would radar picket ships .</s>

<s>a squadron of Navy jets and another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier task forces .</s>

<s>three requirements go with a blockade : it must be proclaimed ;
the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it ;
and it must be enforced without discrimination .</s>

<s>once these conditions of international law are met , countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk .</s>

<s>blockade runners can be stopped -- by gunfire , if necessary -- searched and held , at least temporarily .</s>

<s>they could be sent to U.S. ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated .</s>

<s>what could a blockade accomplish ?</s>

<s>plenty , say the experts .</s>

<s>in a broad sense , it would reaffirm the Monroe Doctrine by opposing Communist interference in the Western Hemisphere .</s>

<s>it could , by avoiding direct intervention , provide a short-of-war strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration .</s>

<s>primary target would be shipments of tanks , guns , aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from Russia and Czechoslovakia .</s>

<s>shipments of arms from Western countries could similarly be seized as contraband .</s>

<s>in a total blockade , action could also be taken against ships bringing in chemicals , oils , textiles , and even foodstuffs .</s>

<s>at times , three ships a day from the Soviet bloc are unloading in Cuban ports .</s>

<s>from its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public Law 236 , 66th Congress , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the States , by means of grants-in-aid , to return disabled men and women to productive , gainful employment .</s>

<s>the authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent as Title 5 of the Social Security Act in 1935 .</s>

<s>up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job .</s>

<s>recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78th Congress in 1943 passed P. L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure .</s>

<s>recent changes .</s>

<s>despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation's backlog of an estimated two million disabled .</s>

<s>to assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities , the 83rd Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954 ( P. L. 565 ) .</s>

<s>these amendments to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and half-way workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program's overall effectiveness .</s>

<s>financial aspects .</s>

<s>under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50-50 basis .</s>

<s>under P. L. 113 , 78th Congress , the Federal Government assumed responsibility for 100% of necessary State expenditures in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50% of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services .</s>

<s>throughout these years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act .</s>

<s>the 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program , providing for a three-part grant structure -- for ( 1 ) basic support ;
( 2 ) extension and improvement ;
and ( 3 ) research , demonstrations , training and traineeships for vocational rehabilitation -- and in addition for short-term training and instruction .</s>

<s>the first part of the new structure -- that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services -- is described in this Section .</s>

<s>subsequent sections on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure .</s>

<s>the following table shows , for selected years , the authorizations , appropriations , allotment base , Federal grants to States and State matching funds for this part of the grant program : method of distributing funds description of formula .</s>

<s>in order to assist the States in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services , Section 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for support of such services be based on ( 1 ) need , as measured by a State's population , and ( 2 ) fiscal capacity , as measured by its per capita income .</s>

<s>the Act further provides for a floor or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the base allotment , and a ceiling or maximum allotment , for each State .</s>

<s>it stipulates , in addition , that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing the ceiling , and not used for insuring the floor , be redistributed to those States still below their maximums .</s>

<s>these provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the States , with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a State with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated State .</s>

<s>the provisions are also designed to avoid disruption in State programs already in operation , which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone .</s>
